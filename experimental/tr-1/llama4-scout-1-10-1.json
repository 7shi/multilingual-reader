    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "Several large segments of the original text were not translated into Spanish and were instead included in French, sometimes with added English meta-comments, or partial, incorrect Spanish. This severely obstructs the reader's ability to understand the content. For instance, Camille's line about the AI being a 'young graduate' and Luc's consultant analogy are untranslated. Even in the translated parts, minor grammatical errors ('la IA hace de mismo' instead of 'lo mismo') and unnatural phrasing ('Ella lee una cantidad masiva') slightly hinder easy comprehension.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation suffers significantly from a lack of fluency due to the untranslated segments and the inclusion of original French text within the Spanish dialogue. This breaks the natural flow entirely. In the translated portions, there are instances of stiff or literal translation ('en el aviso' for 'dans le prompt', 'Ella olvida todo' repeated, 'Es pues una memoria de un solo uso') and minor grammatical issues that make the text sound less natural to a native Spanish speaker. The inconsistent use of 'usted' for a general podcast audience also impacts the naturalness.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally handles core technical terms well, such as 'pre-entrenamiento' (pré-entraînement), 'ajuste fino' (affinage) with 'fine-tuning' provided, 'aprendizaje por transferencia' (apprentissage par transfert), 'ventana de contexto' (fenêtre de contexte), 'aprendizaje en contexto' (apprentissage en contexte) with 'ICL' provided, and 'anclaje' (ancrage) with 'grounding' provided. However, the translation of 'prompt' as 'aviso' is less common and could be improved ('instrucción' or simply 'prompt'). More critically, the problem of untranslated sections directly impacts terminology consistency, as key concepts are presented in French instead of Spanish.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and format of a tech podcast dialogue are maintained when the text is actually translated. However, the presence of untranslated French blocks, interspersed with English meta-comments, completely disrupts the contextual adaptation, making the 'podcast transcript' incoherent for a Spanish-speaking audience. The tone is mostly preserved in the translated sections, but the issues with fluency and terminology (e.g., 'aviso' for 'prompt') slightly detract from a perfect adaptation to the target context.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This criterion is severely impacted by the significant portions of the original text that are not translated. Several critical explanations and dialogue exchanges are either missing entirely from the Spanish output, presented in their original French, or appear with confusing mixed-language formatting. For example, Camille's analogy of AI as a 'young graduate', Luc's consultant analogy for ICL, and his detailed explanation of the permanence of fine-tuning knowledge are largely absent or highly problematic in the translation, leading to substantial gaps in information for the Spanish reader.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation exhibits major deficiencies across all evaluation criteria, primarily due to numerous large segments of the original French text being left untranslated or presented in a highly fragmented and confusing manner with mixed languages (French, Spanish, English meta-comments). This severely impacts readability, fluency, and, most critically, information completeness, as crucial parts of the dialogue are missing. While some technical terms are correctly rendered, the overall quality suggests a significant failure in the translation process, likely a partial or unedited machine translation. The translated parts also contain several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from naturalness. Substantial editing and re-translation of the omitted segments are required to make this text functional and comprehensible for a Spanish audience."
