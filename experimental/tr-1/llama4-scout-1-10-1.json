  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The readability is severely compromised as large portions of the text are left untranslated, appearing in French or English within the Spanish output. Some sections are even marked 'Spanish translation result' without actual content. This makes the text incomprehensible to a Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation lacks any fluency due to the presence of untranslated French and English sentences, as well as placeholder text. The parts that are translated also suffer from awkward phrasing and inconsistent use of 'tú' and 'usted' forms, preventing a natural flow.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While some core terms like 'pre-entrenamiento' and 'ajuste fino' are correctly translated, the overall handling of terminology is poor. Many technical terms are untranslated. Additionally, 'bachotage' (cramming) is incorrectly translated as 'hacer trampa' (to cheat), which is a significant semantic error in a technical context.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to adapt to the target context effectively. The most notable issue is the inconsistent use of formal ('usted') and informal ('tú') address forms throughout the dialogue, which is a basic contextual adaptation requirement in Spanish. The overall intent of explaining AI concepts is lost due to the incompleteness of the translation.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The information completeness is critically low. Multiple significant paragraphs and sentences from the original French text are completely missing from the Spanish translation, replaced by either the original French text, English text, or the placeholder 'Spanish translation result'. This means a substantial amount of the original information is not conveyed.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation is highly incomplete and inaccurate. Large sections of the original text are left untranslated (in French or English), or marked with placeholders, making the output unusable. The portions that are translated exhibit inconsistencies in address forms (tú/usted) and some incorrect terminology ('bachotage' translated as 'hacer trampa'). This submission fails to meet basic translation quality standards."
