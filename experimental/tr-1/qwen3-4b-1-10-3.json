    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally understandable, and the concepts are conveyed. However, frequent grammatical errors, awkward sentence structures directly translated from French, and some less natural word choices (e.g., 'Por lo tanto' used repetitively, 'la manera en que') impede the smooth flow and require the reader to re-read or mentally correct phrases, thus reducing overall readability.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation suffers significantly from a lack of naturalness. There are numerous grammatical errors, particularly concerning gender and number agreement ('poco información', 'Las conocimientos', 'estos herramientas'), and inconsistent use of formal/informal address ('tú' vs. 'usted'). Phrases like 'Vea mejor' for 'Voyez plutôt', 'le proporcionar' instead of 'proporcionarle', and 'Gracias por haber escuchado a nosotros' are very awkward and not idiomatic in Spanish. The anglicism 'fine-tunes un modelo' is also a notable error.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are translated correctly (e.g., 'preentrenamiento', 'afinamiento', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto'). The inclusion of English terms in parentheses ('fine-tuning', 'ICL', 'grounding') is helpful for clarity. However, the inconsistent use of 'afinamiento' versus the direct English verb 'fine-tunes' is an issue. The translation of 'ancrage' as 'ancrage' with 'grounding' is acceptable but could be more precisely adapted for the context. The colloquial 'antisèche' was poorly rendered as 'preparación', missing the intended nuance.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text is a conversational podcast, but the translation often loses this informal, engaging tone due to overly literal translations, repetitive formal connectors ('Por lo tanto'), and grammatical stiffness. The analogy of 'une antisèche' (a cheat sheet) which is crucial to conveying the concept of temporary knowledge, is poorly translated as 'una preparación', thus losing its contextual impact and humor. The general intent to explain AI concepts is present, but the delivery is not optimally adapted to a natural Spanish podcast style.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original text has been conveyed in the translation without any omissions. The core concepts of pre-training, fine-tuning, in-context learning, and the differences between temporary and permanent knowledge are all present. No extraneous information has been added, and the content remains concise despite the fluency issues.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation successfully conveys the core information and technical concepts from the French source text. However, its overall quality is significantly hindered by persistent issues in fluency and naturalness. There are numerous grammatical errors, awkward literal translations, and inconsistencies in tone and terminology that make the text sound less professional and less engaging than a native Spanish podcast would. While the content is complete, the presentation frequently detracts from the listening experience. Significant revisions are needed to improve the linguistic quality and ensure it reads like an original Spanish script."
