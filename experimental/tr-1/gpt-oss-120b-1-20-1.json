    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The vast majority of the translated text is missing. What remains are ellipses, placeholder characters, or entirely omitted sections, making it impossible for a reader to understand the content. Only one sentence is partially translated, but it's isolated and lacks any surrounding context.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "With almost the entire text missing, there is no natural flow or coherence. The isolated translated sentence is grammatically acceptable, but it's insufficient to establish any level of fluency for the overall text.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are absent because the corresponding parts of the original text were not translated. While 'ajuste fino' for 'fine-tuning' (from 'affinage') is an acceptable translation in the one instance it appears, the lack of other critical terminology and context makes this criterion score very low.",

    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent, tone, and purpose of the podcast dialogue are completely lost due to the extensive omissions. There's no effective conveyance of information or adaptation to the target audience's cultural context.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This is the most critical issue. The translation omits almost all information from the original text. Only a tiny fraction of one sentence is present, meaning the vast majority of the content is missing, rendering the translation completely incomplete and unusable.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation is severely incomplete and largely unusable. Almost the entire original text is missing, replaced by ellipses or non-text characters. Only a single sentence is partially translated, making it impossible to evaluate readability, fluency, terminology, or contextual adaptation meaningfully. The information completeness is virtually zero."
