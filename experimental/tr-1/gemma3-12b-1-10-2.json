  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is severely incomplete, with large segments of the original text missing or replaced by untranslated English phrases, internal thought processes, or truncated sentences. This makes the text incoherent and utterly unreadable for a Spanish speaker, preventing any understanding of the original content or its logical flow.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Due to the extensive missing content, truncated sentences, and insertion of non-Spanish text (English phrases, internal notes), the translated text entirely lacks fluency and naturalness. It reads as a disjointed collection of words and phrases rather than a coherent dialogue in Spanish.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While some technical terms like 'pre-entrenamiento', 'ajuste fino', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', and 'ventana de contexto' are correctly translated when they appear, the vast majority of the technical explanations and their consistent use are absent or corrupted by the incomplete translation. Therefore, a comprehensive assessment of terminology handling is impossible, and its overall application is severely flawed.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text is a podcast transcript, requiring a conversational, engaging, and educational tone. The translated output, riddled with omissions and errors, completely fails to adapt to this context. The core intent and purpose of explaining AI concepts are lost due to the fragmented and incomprehensible nature of the translation.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This is the most critical failure point. Significant portions of the original text have been omitted from the translation, or replaced with non-target language content (English phrases) or internal processing notes. Crucial information, explanations, and dialogue exchanges are missing, rendering the 'translated' text entirely incomplete and devoid of the original meaning.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation is fundamentally flawed and unusable. It is extremely incomplete, with large segments of the original French text either completely missing, replaced by English words/phrases, or by internal thought processes/instructions. The output is a disjointed collection of words that does not constitute a coherent or accurate translation. It appears as though the translation process failed or was interrupted, leading to a severely compromised result."
