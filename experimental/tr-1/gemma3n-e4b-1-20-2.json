    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The readability is significantly hampered by a critical error where an entire sentence explaining 'In-Context Learning' is corrupted and missing from the translation. This creates a major gap in information, making the subsequent discussion hard to follow. Additionally, there are instances of awkward phrasing ('realmente real') and inconsistent use of formal and informal address ('tú' vs 'usted'), which can be confusing for the reader.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation suffers from inconsistent use of formal and informal address (e.g., switching between 'tus' and 'usted' forms), which sounds unnatural to a native speaker. Grammatical errors like 'se ataca' instead of 'se ataque' or a more appropriate verb, and unnatural phrasing such as 'presentárselo' (should be 'presentarle') and 'con tus conversaciones' instead of 'mediante', also detract from the overall fluency and naturalness.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While standard technical terms like 'pre-entrenamiento', 'ajuste fino' (fine-tuning), and 'aprendizaje por transferencia' are correctly translated, the complete omission of the crucial sentence defining 'In-Context Learning' (ICL) means that a core technical concept is not introduced or explained in the Spanish text. This is a major terminology failure despite other terms being correct. 'Anclaje' for 'grounding' is acceptable, but there might be more common equivalents in a technical context.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational and explanatory tone of a podcast is generally maintained in parts of the translation. However, the severe information gap caused by the missing sentence significantly hinders the ability to convey the original text's intent of clearly explaining AI concepts. The inconsistencies in formality (tú/usted) also detract from a consistent podcast style.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This is the weakest aspect of the translation. A critical sentence, 'Oui, et elle est rendue possible par l'expansion massive de la mémoire à court terme de l'IA, ou « fenêtre de contexte ». Cette approche s'appelle l'apprentissage en contexte, ou ICL (In-Context Learning),' is completely missing and replaced by gibberish. This is a severe omission of vital information. Minor omissions like 'C'est un sujet fascinant' and 'J'ai déjà entendu ce terme' also exist.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the general conversational style of a podcast and accurately translates many individual phrases and common technical terms. However, its quality is severely compromised by a critical error: an entire, crucial sentence explaining 'In-Context Learning' is completely omitted and replaced by corrupted text. This leads to a significant loss of information and severely impacts the coherence and readability of the explanation. Furthermore, the translation suffers from inconsistent use of formal and informal address, awkward grammatical constructions, and some less precise word choices (e.g., 'realmente real', 'libreta de apuntes' for 'antisèche'). These issues collectively detract from the overall fluency, naturalness, and accuracy of the translation."
