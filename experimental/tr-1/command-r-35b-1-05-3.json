    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "While most of the text is comprehensible, several grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and the significant mistranslation of \"ré-entraîner\" for \"retraer\" (retrain vs. retract) create points of confusion. The inconsistent use of formal and informal 'you' (tú/usted/ustedes) also forces the reader to mentally adjust, reducing the overall ease of understanding and flow.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The most prominent issue affecting fluency is the inconsistent use of address (tú/usted/ustedes). This creates an unnatural and jarring listening experience for a podcast. Additionally, some vocabulary choices are either unnatural (\"estimulador\" for \"prompt\") or could be improved for better flow and idiomatic expression (\"hace surgir\" instead of \"está surgiendo\"). Grammatical errors like \"Las conocimientos\" and \"Toda la historial\" further detract from naturalness.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Terminology is a major weakness. \"L'affinage\" (fine-tuning) is translated inconsistently (\"especialización,\" \"afinación,\" \"refinamiento\"), when \"ajuste fino\" or consistent \"afinamiento\" would be appropriate. \"L'apprentissage par transfert\" alternates between \"transferencia de conocimientos\" and the more accurate \"aprendizaje por transferencia.\" Crucially, \"prompt\" is mistranslated as \"estimulador,\" which is incorrect in AI contexts. \"Ré-entraîner\" (retrain) is rendered as \"retraer\" (retract), a fundamental error in a technical discussion. These inconsistencies and errors undermine the technical accuracy.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation successfully conveys the intent and purpose of explaining AI concepts. The title adaptation \"Tecnología Al Instante\" is good. However, the inconsistent formal/informal address (tú/usted/ustedes) is a significant flaw in contextual adaptation for a podcast format. A consistent register is essential for establishing a clear relationship with the audience. While no major cultural missteps are present, the inconsistent voice makes the dialogue less engaging and professional.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the information from the original text is conveyed. However, the mistranslation of \"ré-entraîner\" to \"retraer\" represents a critical distortion of information regarding a core AI process. While other grammatical issues might obscure information slightly, this specific error directly misrepresents a key concept. The choice of \"guía\" for \"antisèche\" also loses a nuanced implication.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation provides a generally understandable rendition of the French podcast. However, it is significantly hampered by prevalent inconsistencies in addressing the audience (tú/usted/ustedes), which breaks the natural flow and professionalism suitable for a podcast. There are notable mistranslations of key technical terms, such as \"retraer\" for \"retrain\" and \"estimulador\" for \"prompt,\" along with inconsistent terminology choices for \"fine-tuning\" and \"transfer learning.\" Grammatical errors like subject-verb agreement (e.g., \"Las conocimientos\") and awkward phrasings also detract from its fluency and readability. While the core message is transmitted, the cumulative effect of these issues indicates a need for thorough revision to achieve a high-quality, technically accurate, and natural-sounding translation."
