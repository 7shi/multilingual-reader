    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is extremely fragmented and contains numerous untranslated sections, including direct quotes from the original French, internal AI thought processes (e.g., '1. Syntactic Analysis', '2. Contextual Interpretation'), and completely blank lines. This makes the text incoherent and impossible for a reader to follow or understand the content.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While some isolated sentences are grammatically correct and flow reasonably well in Spanish, the overwhelming presence of missing segments, abrupt cut-offs, and embedded non-Spanish text (English comments, French original phrases) completely destroys the natural flow and rhythm of the dialogue. It does not sound natural at all to a native speaker.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms like 'pre-entrenamiento' and 'aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)' are correctly translated where they appear. However, the term for 'bachoter' (cramming) is incorrectly translated as 'empalmar' instead of 'empollar' or 'estudiar de memoria'. Crucially, the explanation and translation for 'ancrage' (grounding) are entirely missing. The frequent presence of untranslated text segments also means many terms are not handled at all.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text is a conversational podcast transcript. Due to the severe fragmentation, missing content, and inclusion of AI internal monologue, the conversational tone and explanatory purpose of the podcast are entirely lost. The analogies and nuances are either missing or delivered in a broken, unintelligible manner, failing to adapt to the target audience's needs or the original context.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This is the most critical failure point. A significant portion of the original text's information is completely missing from the translation. Entire paragraphs and speaker lines are either omitted, replaced by internal AI comments/placeholders, or left untranslated (e.g., Luc's explanation of fine-tuning, Camille's explanation of grounding, large parts of the discussion on memory and ICL). The translation only covers a fraction of the original content.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is critically flawed and essentially unusable. It suffers from severe information loss, extensive fragmentation, and the inclusion of non-translated content, including internal processing notes from the language model itself. This makes the text incoherent, unreadable, and completely fails to convey the original message. It appears as if the translation process was interrupted or incomplete, resulting in a highly compromised output."
