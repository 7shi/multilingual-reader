    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is mostly clear and easy to follow. However, the translation of \"Vous avez tout compris\" as \"Eso es exactamente como contratar a un consultor brillante\" is a significant error that completely changes the meaning and speaker's intent, heavily impacting comprehensibility at that point. Other minor issues include \"¿C'est a decir?\" instead of \"¿Es decir?\" and \"asombrosamente poco información nueva\" instead of \"asombrosamente poca información nueva\". The typo \"alasiento\" also slightly hinders reading.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational tone is largely preserved, but several instances break the natural flow. The direct translation of \"C'est-à-dire?\" into \"¿C'est a decir?\" is completely unnatural in Spanish. The switch between \"tú\" (e.g., \"tus datos\", \"tu nueva petición\", \"tu proyecto\") and \"vosotros\" (\"vuestras conversaciones\", \"vuestro historial\") forms when addressing the listener creates an inconsistent and somewhat awkward register. The replacement of \"Vous avez tout compris\" with a fragment of the subsequent speaker's dialogue severely disrupts the conversational turn-taking.",

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently and appropriately translated or transliterated, such as \"pre-entrenamiento,\" \"ajuste fino (fine-tuning),\" \"aprendizaje por transferencia,\" \"ventana de contexto,\" \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL),\" and \"anclaje (grounding).\" The term \"prompt\" is correctly adopted and italicized. The handling of domain-specific vocabulary is strong.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall podcast dialogue format and informal, explanatory style are well-maintained. The analogies are effectively transferred. However, the significant error in replacing Camille's affirming statement \"Vous avez tout compris\" with a phrase from Luc's subsequent explanation completely alters the immediate context and dialogue flow. The inconsistency in address forms (\"tú\" vs. \"vosotros\") also slightly detracts from a seamless adaptation to a single, consistent target audience interaction style.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the information from the original text is accurately conveyed, including the key concepts and their explanations. However, Camille's line \"Vous avez tout compris\" is entirely omitted and replaced by an incorrect fragment from Luc's next sentence, representing a direct loss of specific information and a misrepresentation of the dialogue.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a good grasp of technical terminology and generally maintains a conversational and informative tone suitable for a podcast. However, its overall quality is significantly marred by critical errors in dialogue reproduction, most notably the complete misrepresentation and effective omission of a key speaker affirmation (\"Vous avez tout compris\"). Minor grammatical inaccuracies and inconsistent use of address forms (\"tú\" vs. \"vosotros\") also detract from its naturalness and fluency. The final JSON output also exhibited severe formatting issues, including extraneous explanatory text and newline characters within a string value, violating the specified output schema."
