    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally comprehensible, but frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and particularly the mistranslation or non-translation of key informal terms (like 'bachotage' as 'aplastamiento' and 'antisèche' left as is) significantly hinder the reading flow and force the reader to pause and re-interpret sections. While the core message comes across, it requires notable effort from the reader.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text suffers from numerous grammatical inaccuracies, making it sound unnatural and stilted to a native Spanish speaker. Issues include incorrect verb conjugations ('se afinan' instead of 'se afina', 'proporcionar' instead of 'proporcionarle'), lack of agreement in gender and number ('nuevas conocimientos', 'estos herramientas', 'toda la potencia'), redundant pronouns ('Ella lee'), and literal translations of idiomatic expressions ('bienvenido en', 'Yo veo'). The inconsistent use of formal ('usted') and informal ('tú') address forms further detracts from the fluency.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Many technical terms like 'pré-entraînement' (entrenamiento previo), 'apprentissage par transfert' (aprendizaje por transferencia), 'fenêtre de contexte' (ventana de contexto), and 'apprentissage en contexte' (aprendizaje en contexto) are correctly translated. However, the translation of 'affinage' (fine-tuning) as 'afinado' or 'afinamiento' is acceptable but 'ajuste fino' or 'sintonización fina' would be more standard in AI contexts. A major flaw is the complete failure to correctly translate common, context-specific terms like 'bachotage' ('cramming') which is rendered as the nonsensical 'aplastamiento', and 'antisèche' ('cheat sheet') which is left untranslated, leading to significant confusion in crucial explanatory parts.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "While the core intent of explaining AI learning is conveyed, the translation struggles to adapt the dialogue to a natural conversational style appropriate for a Spanish podcast. The attempt to convey a casual yet informative tone is often undermined by literal translations and grammatical errors. The failure to correctly translate informal analogies (like 'bachotage') completely misses the original's communicative intent and cultural nuance. The inconsistent formality in addressing the listener ('usted' mixed with 'tú') is also a significant issue for contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "One sentence from the original text was omitted: 'L'intégralité de l'historique de votre discussion dans cette session constitue le contexte.' Apart from this single omission, all other information from the source text appears to be present in the translation. However, the clarity and effective conveyance of some information are compromised due to significant lexical and grammatical errors, making it difficult for the reader to fully grasp certain concepts.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation attempts to convey the technical discussion but is heavily hampered by numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and poor lexical choices, particularly in rendering informal yet crucial terms. While core technical terms are generally correct, the lack of natural flow and the significant mistranslations of common vocabulary make the text sound unnatural and, in parts, confusing for a native Spanish speaker. Consistency in address form (usted/tú) and a more idiomatic approach to translation are needed for a higher quality output."
