    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "While most of the text is clear, there are several grammatical errors (\"Es sentido\" instead of \"Tiene sentido\", \"las información\" instead of \"la información\", singular/plural inconsistency for \"conocimiento\") and an incorrect explanation of the ICL acronym which directly impacts understanding of a core concept. This hinders overall ease of comprehension.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains several phrases that sound somewhat literal or less natural in Spanish (\"Mira más bien\", \"Es sentido\" - which is also a grammatical error, \"instrumentos\" for tools). The conversational flow is occasionally disrupted by phrases that aren't quite idiomatic or are awkwardly merged, such as the translation of \"On peut dire ça\".",
      "score": 11
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The most significant issue is the mistranslation of \"ICL (In-Context Learning)\" as \"ICL (Aprendizaje por Computadora)\", which is fundamentally incorrect and misinforms the reader about a key concept. Additionally, \"guía\" is an inaccurate translation for \"antisèche\" (cheat sheet), and the podcast title \"Tech Éclair\" is translated inconsistently (\"Tecnología Rápida\" vs \"Tech Claridad\"). These errors demonstrate a lack of precision in technical terminology.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall conversational tone and the use of analogies are largely preserved, which helps convey the original text's purpose of explaining complex concepts simply. However, the presence of grammatical errors and significant terminology inaccuracies (e.g., ICL) detracts from the clarity and authority needed for such an explanatory context, slightly hindering effective adaptation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major pieces of information from the original text are present in the translation. There are no noticeable omissions. However, the information's accuracy is compromised in places, particularly with the incorrect expansion of the ICL acronym and a minor misinterpretation regarding \"what a verb is\" vs \"rules of verbs\". This impacts the quality of the conveyed information, even if it's all \"present\".",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation attempts to convey the information and conversational tone, but it is marred by significant terminology errors (most notably ICL), several grammatical mistakes, and some awkward phrasing. While the core message is largely understandable, these issues undermine its professionalism and accuracy, especially for a technical topic. Consistency in terminology (podcast title) is also lacking."
