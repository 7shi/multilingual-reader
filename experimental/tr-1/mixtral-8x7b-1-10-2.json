    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation suffers significantly from poor readability due to several critical issues. There are untranslated French and English terms ('pré-entraînement', 'La tuning', 'approche', 'fenêtre de contexte', 'ancraje', 'cram'), which hinder understanding. Grammatical errors, such as 'el IA' instead of 'la IA', and inconsistent formality ('Mire' followed by 'enseñarías'), further degrade the text's clarity. Most notably, the inclusion of an entirely extraneous sentence ('2. The speaker, Luc, is expressing the idea...') completely breaks the flow and makes the text nonsensical at that point.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text frequently sounds unnatural and stiff due to overly literal translation from French. The presence of untranslated foreign words (as noted in readability) severely impacts the natural flow for a Spanish speaker. Inconsistencies in addressing the listener (formal 'Mire' then informal 'enseñarías') and the use of non-standard or incorrect technical vocabulary ('afinación'/'tuning' instead of 'ajuste fino') detract significantly from the overall fluency.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "This criterion exhibits major deficiencies. Key technical terms are either left untranslated ('pré-entraînement', 'fenêtre de contexte', 'ancrage', 'approche') or are inconsistently and incorrectly translated. For example, 'l'affinage' is rendered as 'la afinación', 'la tuning', and 'refinamiento' at different points, none of which is the most accurate or common term ('ajuste fino'). The use of 'afilando' for 'constamment affinée' is also technically inaccurate in this context. This lack of appropriate and consistent terminology makes the technical discussion difficult to follow.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely fails to adapt to the podcast context. The conversational and explanatory tone of the original is lost due to literal translations and the array of errors. The most glaring issue is the insertion of an external, non-original sentence ('2. The speaker, Luc, is expressing the idea...') which is completely out of place and destroys the contextual integrity. Untranslated terms also demonstrate a failure to adapt the language for the target Spanish-speaking audience.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Information completeness is severely compromised. The translation includes a significant amount of extraneous information not present in the original text ('2. The speaker, Luc, is expressing the idea...'). Conversely, it omits the correct Spanish equivalents for several key technical terms (e.g., 'fenêtre de contexte', 'ancrage'), which are left in their original French or English forms. This results in a text that is both inaccurate due to additions and incomplete due to omissions, making it unreliable.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation is of very poor quality, marked by numerous critical errors across all evaluation criteria. The most significant issues include the insertion of extraneous, non-original text, widespread failure to translate key technical terminology, inconsistent and often incorrect usage of technical terms, and frequent grammatical errors. The text often reads as a literal, unedited machine translation rather than a human-quality rendition, failing to convey the original's meaning, tone, or fluency. Substantial revision and correction are required."
