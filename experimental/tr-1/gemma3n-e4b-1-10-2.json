    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly comprehensible, but it suffers from several issues that hinder readability. There are multiple grammatical errors ('Imagína' instead of 'Imagina', 'poco información' instead of 'poca información', 'alasiento' instead of 'al asiento', missing opening question marks), and some phrases are direct translations that sound awkward in Spanish ('Esto es donde' instead of 'Aquí es donde', 'Eso es exactamente como' instead of 'Es exactamente como'). The most significant issue affecting readability is the presence of an entire sentence left untranslated in French, as well as a common French idiom ('C'est a dire?') left as is, which completely breaks the flow and comprehension for a Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation lacks naturalness in several places. The use of 'Bonjour' in a Spanish podcast introduction feels out of place. The inconsistencies in formality, oscillating between 'tú' (informal singular), 'usted' (formal singular), and 'vosotros/vuestra' (informal plural, common in Spain), create a disjointed and unnatural feel for native speakers. For example, 'vuestra conversación' is used while 'tu nueva petición' appears elsewhere. The untranslated French sentence and idiom are major fluency blockers, making the text sound jarring and incomplete.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The translation handles technical terminology very well. Terms like 'pre-entrenamiento', 'ajuste fino' (with parenthetical 'fine-tuning'), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto' (with 'ICL'), and 'anclaje' (with 'grounding') are accurately translated and consistently used throughout the text. The explanations of complex concepts are clear, and the use of parenthetical English terms is helpful for context. This is a strong point of the translation.",

    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "While the core intent and purpose of explaining AI concepts are generally conveyed, the translation struggles with contextual adaptation. The inconsistent use of formal/informal address (tú/usted/vosotros) does not align with a consistent tone typically found in a podcast. The untranslated French sentence and idiom are significant failures in adapting the content for a Spanish-speaking audience, as they disrupt the natural flow of a conversation. Although analogies are well-translated, the overall presentation is hampered by these inconsistencies and omissions.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to convey all important information from the original text. However, there is a critical failure in information completeness due to one entire sentence by Camille being left completely untranslated in French: 'como la « Mémoire » que certaines IA commencent à intégrer ? On a l'impression qu'elles commencent vraiment à se souvenir des choses d'une session à l'autre.' This means a significant piece of information and a key question from Camille is entirely missing in the Spanish output, making the subsequent dialogue from Luc less coherent. Furthermore, the French idiom 'C'est a dire?' is also untranslated, causing another gap.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation correctly handles technical terminology, which is crucial for a text of this nature. However, it is significantly undermined by several grammatical errors, inconsistencies in formality, and, most critically, the omission of an entire translated sentence and a phrase from the original French. These errors severely impact readability, fluency, and information completeness, making the final output feel incomplete and unpolished for a professional podcast transcript."
