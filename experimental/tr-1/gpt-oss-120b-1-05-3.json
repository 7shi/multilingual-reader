    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The content is generally easy to understand, and complex concepts are explained clearly. However, the inconsistent use of pronouns of address (tú, usted, ustedes) and a minor grammatical error ('Por qué' instead of 'Porque') create small points of friction that slightly impede smooth reading for a native speaker. Despite these, the overall message is comprehensible.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The most significant issue affecting fluency is the inconsistent use of formal plural ('ustedes'), formal singular ('usted'), and informal singular ('tú') forms of address. This makes the dialogue sound unnatural and choppy to a native Spanish speaker, as a consistent register is expected in a podcast setting. The grammatical error ('Por qué' instead of 'Porque') also detracts from fluency. Vocabulary choices are generally appropriate, but the pronoun shifts are a major drawback.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are translated appropriately and consistently, such as 'preentrenamiento', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto', and 'anclaje'. 'Ajuste fino' is used once, but then 'afinamiento' is used multiple times for 'affinage', which is a minor inconsistency. However, both terms are understandable in context. The inclusion of the English terms in parentheses is helpful.",

    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text's intent and purpose, which is to explain complex AI concepts in an accessible podcast format, are largely conveyed. The metaphor translations, such as 'estudiar a última hora para un examen' for 'bachoter' and 'una chuleta' for 'une antisèche', are excellent and adapt well to the target culture. However, the inconsistent use of pronouns of address fails to adapt the conversational tone consistently to the Spanish-speaking audience, creating a disjointed feel.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original text has been conveyed without any omissions. The explanations are complete, and no significant details seem to be missing or misinterpreted. The translation maintains the clarity and conciseness of the original while providing all necessary information.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate in conveying the technical content and main points of the original French podcast. Many technical terms are handled very well, and the translation includes excellent idiomatic adaptations. However, the overall quality is significantly hampered by a persistent inconsistency in the use of pronouns of address ('tú', 'usted', 'ustedes'). This lack of a consistent register makes the dialogue sound unnatural and less professional for a podcast. Additionally, there is a minor grammatical error ('Por qué' instead of 'Porque') and a slight inconsistency in the translation of 'affinage'. Addressing these issues would greatly improve the fluency and naturalness of the translation."
