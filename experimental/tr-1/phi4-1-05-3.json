    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The presence of a large, irrelevant block of English text (evaluation criteria) directly inserted into Luc's dialogue completely breaks the readability and flow of the translation. A Spanish reader would find this segment incomprehensible and nonsensical. While other parts of the text are generally well-translated and easy to understand, this critical error makes the translation unusable as a whole.",

    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The insertion of an external evaluation prompt directly into the dialogue utterly destroys the naturalness and smoothness of the conversation at that point. It's not just awkward; it's a complete break in linguistic coherence. Minor issues like 'nuevas conocimientos' (should be 'nuevos') and inconsistent use of 'vuestras' vs. 'sus' are present, but the primary error is catastrophic for fluency.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The specific technical term 'l'affinage (fine-tuning)' at the problematic line is not translated correctly; instead, it is replaced by a chunk of irrelevant text, completely failing to convey the original meaning or term. While other technical terms like 'preentrenamiento,' 'aprendizaje por transferencia,' 'ventana de contexto,' and 'anclaje' are handled appropriately and consistently with their English counterparts in parentheses, this single severe error is a critical failure in conveying terminology accurately at a key point.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to effectively convey the original text's intent and purpose due to the insertion of extraneous content. The conversational tone and the logical progression of ideas are severely disrupted by the unparsed text, making it impossible for the reader to follow the intended discussion about AI training stages. This error completely undermines the contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The crucial information about 'l'affinage (fine-tuning)' in Luc's dialogue is entirely omitted, replaced by an irrelevant block of text. This represents a significant omission of important information from the original text. While other parts of the text are complete, this major gap makes the translation incomplete and misleading at a key point in the explanation.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation contains a critical and pervasive error: a large block of unrelated English text (likely an internal prompt or evaluation criteria) is directly inserted into one of Luc's dialogue lines, replacing the actual translation. This single error makes the translation unusable and severely impacts every aspect of quality, including readability, fluency, terminology, contextual adaptation, and information completeness. While the *rest* of the translation (excluding this specific segment) generally demonstrates good linguistic choices, appropriate terminology, and natural flow, the presence of this unparsed content renders the overall output unacceptable. It appears to be an artifact of the generation process rather than a translation error per se, but it's present in the final output."
