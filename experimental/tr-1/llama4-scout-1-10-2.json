    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The readability is extremely low due to significant portions of the text being either untranslated (copied directly from French or English) or replaced with placeholders like 'Spanish translation result'. A native Spanish speaker would not be able to follow the conversation or understand the concepts being discussed because critical information is missing or in the wrong language.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The fluency is severely compromised by the presence of untranslated French and English sentences, as well as the 'Spanish translation result' placeholders. These completely break the natural flow and rhythm of the conversation. Even within the translated sections, there are minor awkward phrases (e.g., 'una forma astuta' for 'une forme astuce') and one major semantic error ('hacer trampa' for 'bachotage') that detract from naturalness.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While some technical terms like 'pré-entraînement' (pre-entrenamiento), 'affinage' (ajuste fino), 'fenêtre de contexte' (ventana de contexto), 'apprentissage en contexte' (aprendizaje en contexto), and 'ancrage' (anclaje) are correctly translated, the overall score is low due to several critical issues. Crucially, many technical explanations are completely missing because entire paragraphs were not translated. Furthermore, there are significant semantic errors, such as translating 'bachotage' (cramming/superficial study) as 'hacer trampa' (cheating), which fundamentally alters the meaning of the analogy, and 'antisèche' (cheat sheet) as 'un apoyo' (a support), which is too generic and loses the specific technical nuance.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The contextual adaptation is very poor. The original text's intent to explain complex AI concepts through accessible analogies is completely undermined by the extensive missing and untranslated content. Key analogies are either omitted or their meaning is distorted (e.g., the 'cramming' analogy becoming 'cheating'). The tone and purpose of the podcast format are lost when large parts of the dialogue are not rendered in the target language.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The information completeness is critically lacking. Several large sections of the original text are either completely omitted (replaced by 'Spanish translation result'), or directly copied from the French source without translation, or even copied from an English source, leaving vast gaps in the information presented to the Spanish reader. This includes crucial explanations of how transfer learning works, the reality of ICL, and the difference between temporary and permanent AI knowledge. The translation is fundamentally incomplete.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation is severely deficient. The most significant issue is the extensive lack of completeness, with multiple paragraphs left untranslated, replaced by placeholders, or copied from other languages. This renders the text largely unreadable and incomprehensible. Even in the sections that are translated, there are notable semantic inaccuracies (e.g., 'cramming' translated as 'cheating' and 'cheat sheet' as 'support') and minor grammatical awkwardness. This translation does not fulfill its purpose of conveying the original content in Spanish."
