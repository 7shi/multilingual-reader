    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "Two significant segments of Luc's dialogue were either completely mistranslated ('llevar' for 'Exactement. Mais cela nous amène...') or replaced by an unrelated block of text resembling internal evaluation notes. This fundamentally breaks the flow of the conversation, making large parts of the translated text incomprehensible and unreadable as a continuous dialogue. While other parts of the translation are generally comprehensible, the critical errors render the overall submission unusable.",

    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The presence of non-translated content and the insertion of an unrelated text block severely disrupt the natural flow and smoothness of the dialogue. Additionally, there's an inconsistent use of 'tú' (informal singular), 'usted' (formal singular), and 'ustedes' (formal plural) when translating the French 'vous', which should maintain a consistent formal tone in this podcast context. Some phrases, like 'conocimiento de las mismas informaciones' and 'nuevas conocimientos', also sound unnatural or are grammatically incorrect, further impacting fluency.",

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While some core technical terms like 'preentrenamiento', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto', and 'anclaje' are correctly identified and translated, the consistency is poor. The term 'affinage' is inconsistently translated, sometimes as 'fine-tuning' (an English loanword) and other times as 'ajuste fino'. The severe errors, particularly the missing dialogue, make it impossible to fully evaluate the appropriate use and consistency of terminology across the entire text.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The primary intent of the original text is to educate listeners about AI learning processes in an accessible, conversational podcast format. The critical omissions and corruptions in the translation prevent this intent from being conveyed effectively. The dialogue is broken, and key explanations are missing, making the translation fail to fulfill the purpose of the original content.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This criterion is critically failed. Two substantial portions of Luc's dialogue are either entirely missing or replaced by irrelevant text. This means a significant amount of crucial information and explanation from the original French text is not present in the Spanish translation, making it fundamentally incomplete.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation contains critical, severe errors that render it unusable. Significant portions of the dialogue are either completely missing or replaced by irrelevant content, making the conversation unintelligible and incomplete. Beyond these major flaws, there are also issues with inconsistent pronoun usage (tú/usted/ustedes), inconsistent terminology for 'fine-tuning', and some grammatical inaccuracies or awkward phrasing. The translation fails to convey the original message or maintain the contextual integrity of the podcast."
