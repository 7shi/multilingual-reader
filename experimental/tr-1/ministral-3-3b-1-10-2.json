    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is severely compromised by numerous incomplete sentences, untranslated English fragments, and large blocks of internal reasoning notes that are not part of the actual translation. This makes the text utterly incomprehensible and impossible for a target language reader to follow or understand coherently.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The output lacks any natural flow or smoothness due to the extensive incompleteness and the inclusion of non-translated content. Even the few accurately translated phrases are disjointed by the surrounding errors, preventing any sense of naturalness. Grammatical errors like \"el palabras\" and \"varias años\" further detract from fluency.",

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While some technical terms like \"pre-entrenamiento,\" \"aprendizaje por transferencia,\" and \"ventana de contexto\" are correctly identified and translated in the isolated instances where translation occurs, the vast majority of the text, including explanations of other crucial terms like \"affinage\" (fine-tuning), is either missing or replaced by internal notes. This makes a consistent evaluation of terminology impossible.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text's conversational podcast format and its intent to explain complex AI concepts are completely lost. The fragmented nature, missing dialogue, and inclusion of internal notes destroy any sense of context or purpose. The inconsistent use of formal/informal address (e.g., \"proporcionáis\") also indicates a lack of adaptation to the target audience and medium.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is critically incomplete. A significant portion of the original dialogue and explanatory content is either omitted, untranslated, or replaced by internal translation process notes. Key arguments, analogies, and narrative progression are entirely absent, rendering the information provided highly fragmented and insufficient.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation is critically flawed and unusable. It is severely incomplete, frequently replacing the actual translated text with untranslated English fragments or internal reasoning notes from the translation process. A substantial amount of the original content is entirely missing, and what little is translated contains grammatical errors and inconsistencies. The output fails to provide a coherent, accurate, or complete rendition of the source text."
