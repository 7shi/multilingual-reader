    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The readability is severely hampered by numerous formatting artifacts such as 'Traducción al español:' prefixes, unexpected italics, and single quotes around some phrases. These elements disrupt the flow and make it very difficult for a reader to consume the content naturally. Additionally, significant omissions and un-translated segments create gaps in understanding, forcing the reader to guess the context or original intent.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation lacks fluency due to a combination of factors. Major omissions result in disjointed sentences and incomplete thoughts. Several sentences are left untranslated, directly presenting English or French text within the Spanish output. Grammatical errors, such as 'conocimientos [...] quedan almacenadas' (gender disagreement) and 'Eso es la manera' (demonstrative pronoun agreement), further detract from naturalness. Inconsistent use of formal and informal address ('tú' vs. 'Vean' / 'vuestras') also makes the dialogue sound awkward.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Where technical terms are translated, they are generally handled well. Terms like 'pre-entrenamiento', 'ajuste fino' (fine-tuning), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto' (ICL), and 'anclaje' (grounding) are appropriate and often include their English equivalents for clarity. The term 'prompt' is correctly retained. However, the consistent application of this appropriate terminology is undermined by the many omissions and formatting issues that obscure the context in which these terms appear.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text's podcast format, characterized by a conversational and informative tone, is largely lost in the translation. The disruptive formatting, numerous omissions, and grammatical errors prevent the natural flow of a dialogue. While some efforts are made to adapt idiomatic expressions (e.g., 'en coulisses' to 'detrás de cámaras'), these isolated successes are overshadowed by the overall lack of cohesion and naturalness. The shifts in register also make the dialogue less consistent with a friendly podcast setting.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This is one of the weakest aspects of the translation. There are multiple, significant omissions of entire sentences and large portions of dialogue. For example, Camille's opening line, substantial parts of Luc's explanation about ICL vs. fine-tuning, Luc's bicycle analogy, and several of Camille's questions/responses are either completely missing or reduced to a single word. This makes it impossible to fully grasp the information being conveyed and follow the conversation's progression, rendering the translation highly incomplete.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation quality is very poor due to severe issues across multiple criteria. The most prominent problems are the frequent and substantial omissions of text, making the dialogue incoherent and incomplete. Furthermore, the presence of intrusive formatting artifacts like 'Traducción al español:' prefixes, unexpected italics, and quotes significantly hinders readability and fluency. While some technical terms are translated appropriately, the overall execution is critically flawed by grammatical errors, inconsistent register, and the failure to deliver a cohesive and natural-sounding Spanish transcript. It fails to convey the original content effectively."
