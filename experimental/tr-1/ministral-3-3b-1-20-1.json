    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely unreadable as a coherent translation. It contains extensive meta-commentary, original French phrases, English phrases, and fragmented Spanish sentences interspersed with instructions and justifications. This makes it impossible for a target language reader to follow the content. Many speaker lines are incomplete or replaced by non-translated elements, rendering the text incomprehensible.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Fluency is entirely compromised by the fragmentation, the inclusion of non-translated text, and meta-commentary. Even in the few segments where Spanish sentences exist, some contain awkward phrasing or grammatical errors (e.g., 'Exactamente es el aprendizaje en contexto en acción' instead of 'Exactamente, es el aprendizaje...'). The mixing of languages (e.g., 'La IA no se afinar constantly') further destroys any sense of natural flow. The opening and closing remarks are either missing or severely cut, which directly impacts the conversational fluency expected in a podcast.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While some technical terms are correctly identified and translated (e.g., 'pre-entrenamiento', 'afinado', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'anclaje'), the overall handling of terminology is inconsistent due to the massive presence of non-translated segments, English phrases ('You can take', 'to relearn from scratch'), and direct instructions for translation. Many lines where terminology would appear are either missing or replaced by comments. Therefore, the consistent and appropriate use of terminology across the entire text is not demonstrated.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation completely fails to adapt to the podcast context. The opening and closing greetings are almost entirely missing. The conversational tone is lost due to the highly fragmented nature and the insertion of evaluation comments. The presence of detailed justifications and instructions within the 'translated' text clearly indicates a failure to understand the purpose of the output, which should be a clean, natural-sounding translation of a podcast script, not an analysis document.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is severely incomplete. Large portions of the original text, including entire sentences and critical introductory/concluding remarks, are missing. Instead, the 'translation' contains extensive meta-commentary, instructions, and non-translated snippets, which entirely replace the intended content. This makes it impossible to retrieve the full information from the original text.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "This submission is not a translation but a highly fragmented document containing extensive meta-commentary, justifications, instructions, and non-translated segments (both French and English), alongside a few partially translated Spanish phrases. It utterly fails on all criteria, particularly information completeness, readability, and contextual adaptation, as the majority of the original text is either missing or replaced by evaluative notes. It does not fulfill the basic requirement of being a coherent and complete translation."
