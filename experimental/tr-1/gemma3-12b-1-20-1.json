  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The readability of the translated text is extremely poor. Large sections of the original content are either missing, replaced by fragments, or filled with untranslated English text and what appears to be internal AI processing commentary. This makes the text nonsensical and impossible to follow as a coherent conversation. For instance, entire paragraphs are replaced by notes like ') to emphasize that the AI doesn't start from scratch...' or 'You've got it all. It's like hiring a brilliant consultant...'.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text lacks any semblance of naturalness or fluency. The frequent omissions, incomplete sentences, direct inclusion of English phrases, and apparent AI process notes break the flow entirely. Phrases like 'totalmente nueva/o' standing alone, or 'Camille: ,' are clear indicators of non-fluent output. The text does not sound like native Spanish speech or writing.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While a few technical terms such as 'pre-entrenamiento' (pré-entraînement), 'ajuste fino' (affinage), 'aprendizaje por transferencia' (apprentissage par transfert), and 'ventana de contexto' (fenêtre de contexte) are correctly translated when they appear, the overall consistency and appropriateness are severely compromised by the massive errors in other parts of the text. Many key technical concepts are either entirely missing due to omissions (e.g., grounding/ancrage explanation) or are part of the corrupted segments.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation completely fails to adapt to the podcast context. The conversational flow is shattered by missing dialogue, out-of-place English text, and fragmented sentences. The intent and purpose of the original dialogue are lost, as the conversation becomes an incoherent jumble rather than an informative discussion about AI.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Information completeness is catastrophically low. Significant portions of the original text are entirely omitted, including full sentences and entire speaker turns. Crucial explanations and analogies are missing, replaced by either empty lines, fragments, or irrelevant notes. This renders the translated content incomplete and uninformative.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation is a critical failure across all evaluation criteria. It exhibits extensive omissions, includes untranslated English text and what appears to be internal processing notes, and features numerous grammatical and structural errors. The resulting text is largely incomprehensible, lacks any natural flow, and fails to convey the vast majority of the original information. It is unusable as a translation."
