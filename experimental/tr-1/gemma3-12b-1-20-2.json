    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is highly fragmented, with large portions of the original French text either completely omitted, replaced by raw notes, syntax analysis, or English sentences. This makes the text completely incoherent and impossible to read as a continuous dialogue. The sentence structure is constantly interrupted, and logical flow is entirely absent.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Due to the severe fragmentation, missing segments, and the insertion of non-translated or meta-textual content, the text lacks any semblance of naturalness or smoothness. It does not sound like a coherent conversation in Spanish. Vocabulary choices, where present, might be individually adequate, but their arrangement within a broken structure renders them meaningless.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While some technical terms like 'pre-entrenamiento' and 'aprendizaje por transferencia' are correctly translated in isolated instances, the overall handling of terminology is abysmal. Key concepts are omitted, truncated, or replaced by internal notes ('aprendizaje a corto plazo' for a full explanation). The presence of English text (e.g., 'You've got it all. It's like hiring a brilliant consultant...') and meta-comments severely compromises any consistency or appropriateness of technical terms within the target text.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text's intent was to explain complex AI concepts in an accessible, conversational podcast format. The provided 'translation' completely fails to convey this intent. The dialogue is shattered, the explanations are missing, and the conversational tone is destroyed. There is no consideration for the target audience's understanding or cultural background, as the text is simply unreadable and filled with irrelevant data.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This is the most critical failure point. Massive portions of the original text are missing. Entire sentences, paragraphs, and even full turns of dialogue are either omitted, replaced by fragments, internal notes, or English text. The vast majority of the information from the original source is not conveyed in the target language. This constitutes a complete failure in information completeness.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "This submission is not a functional translation of the original French text. It is a severely fragmented document containing significant omissions, raw internal notes, English sentences, and syntactic analyses mixed with sporadic, incomplete Spanish translations. As such, it is entirely unreadable and fails to convey any meaningful information from the source. It requires a complete re-translation."
