    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "A large block of internal reasoning and justification for a specific translation choice has been erroneously included in the translated text, specifically within Luc's dialogue. This makes that section completely unreadable and incomprehensible as part of the podcast script, rendering the entire output unusable for its intended purpose. This is a critical error.",

    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The inclusion of detailed internal notes in the middle of a dialogue completely disrupts the flow and naturalness of the text. It breaks the conversational tone and makes the text sound unnatural and nonsensical. Aside from this major issue, there are minor awkward phrasings like \"¿Quieres decir?\" (instead of \"¿Qué quieres decir?\") and a grammatical error with gender agreement (\"Las nuevas conocimientos\" instead of \"Los nuevos conocimientos\"). However, the inserted block is the dominant factor.",

    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While the chosen technical terms like 'preentrenamiento', 'afinado', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto', and 'anclaje' are largely appropriate and consistent, the fact that a large section discussing the handling of 'affinage' is *part of the translation output* indicates a severe failure in delivering a clean, final translation. This meta-commentary should never be part of the translated content, making the handling of terminology inappropriate for the final product.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The purpose of translating a podcast script is to provide a coherent, natural-sounding dialogue in the target language. The insertion of a multi-paragraph internal thought process completely violates the contextual integrity of the translation. It fails to convey the original text's intent as a spoken conversation and is not adapted for a listener/reader of a podcast transcript.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "While all original information from the French source appears to be present, the output contains a significant amount of extraneous and irrelevant information (the internal reasoning/justification block). This severely compromises the conciseness and clarity, as the output is not solely the translation of the original content but includes substantial 'noise' that should have been eliminated. This fails the criterion of keeping the content concise and clear.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation suffers from a critical error: a large block of detailed internal reasoning and justification for a specific translation choice has been erroneously inserted into the output. This renders the translation unusable as a podcast script, as it completely breaks readability, fluency, and contextual adaptation. Without this severe flaw, the rest of the translation demonstrates generally good handling of terminology and information, but the error is so significant that it negates any positive aspects."
