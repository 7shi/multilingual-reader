    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "A large portion of the text is untranslated or garbled, severely impacting readability. Additionally, some phrases are awkward or redundant (\"un proceso realmente real\", \"las informaciones\"), making it less smooth to read.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation frequently lacks naturalness and contains grammatical errors (\"se ataca,\" \"presentárselo una cantidad,\" \"las informaciones\"). The inconsistent use of formal \"usted\" and informal \"tú\" throughout the dialogue makes the text feel disjointed and unnatural for a Spanish native speaker.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms like \"pre-entrenamiento\" and \"ajuste fino\" are generally handled well. However, the complete omission of a crucial paragraph introducing \"fenêtre de contexte\" and \"apprentissage en contexte\" is a significant oversight. The translation of \"antisèche\" as \"libreta de apuntes\" is also inappropriate, as it loses the meaning of \"cheat sheet.\"",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text consistently uses \"vous\" (formal/plural 'you') which implies a certain level of formality or address to a general audience. The translation inconsistently switches between \"tú\" (informal singular) and \"usted\" (formal singular/plural), which breaks the contextual consistency and can be jarring for the reader.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A large and critical paragraph from the original text (starting with \"Oui, et elle est rendue possible par l'expansion massive...\") is entirely missing or garbled in the translation, leading to a complete loss of information at that point. Another phrase, \"J'ai déjà entendu ce terme,\" is also omitted. This renders the translation incomplete and hinders understanding of key concepts.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation suffers from critical flaws, primarily the complete omission or garbling of a large, important section of the original text, which severely impacts information completeness and overall readability. Beyond this major issue, there are consistent problems with grammatical accuracy, naturalness of expression, and inconsistent formality (mixing 'tú' and 'usted' forms) that detract from the overall quality. While some technical terms are translated correctly, the significant omissions negate this strength, making the translated text largely unreliable and unprofessional."
