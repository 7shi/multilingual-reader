    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The readability is severely hampered by numerous grammatical errors, including incorrect gender and number agreement ('Las conocimientos', 'afinan... modifica'), inconsistent use of formal and informal address ('tú' and 'usted' are mixed erratically), and outright nonsensical phrases ('Así es la persistencia de las cuales'). Furthermore, the insertion of a full English sentence makes the text unreadable for a Spanish-only speaker at that point. These issues make it difficult for a native Spanish speaker to follow the conversation smoothly and grasp the intended meaning.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation lacks naturalness and smoothness. Literal translations like 'Eso es decir?' for 'C'est-à-dire ?' and awkward phrasing such as 'Y también soy Luc' sound unnatural in conversational Spanish. The inconsistent use of 'tú' and 'usted' creates a jarring and unprofessional tone for a podcast. Grammatical mistakes and the aforementioned nonsensical phrases significantly detract from the overall fluency, making the text feel very rough and unedited.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most core technical terms like 'pre-entrenamiento', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto', and 'anclaje' are correctly translated and generally appropriate. However, 'afinamiento' for 'fine-tuning' is an acceptable but less common choice than 'ajuste fino'. A significant error is the typo 'bachore' for 'bachotage', which is unintelligible. Despite this, the consistent use of the primary technical terms is a relative strength.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to convey the original intent but falls short in adapting to the podcast context. The inconsistent formal/informal address significantly undermines the conversational tone expected in a podcast. While the analogies are mostly transferred, the lack of natural phrasing and grammatical errors detract from their clarity and impact. The overall adaptation fails to make the dialogue feel genuinely natural or engaging for a Spanish-speaking audience.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Information completeness is a major weakness. Two entire sentences from the original French text are completely omitted from the Spanish translation, leading to significant gaps in the explanation of 'pre-training' and 'fine-tuning'. Furthermore, one crucial question from Camille regarding the persistence of fine-tuned knowledge is completely mistranslated into an unintelligible phrase, causing a complete loss of that specific piece of information. The insertion of an English sentence also means the information is not delivered in the target language.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation exhibits significant weaknesses across multiple criteria. The most critical issues are the numerous omissions and mistranslations of key information, which severely impact information completeness and readability. The pervasive grammatical errors, inconsistent use of formal/informal address, and unnatural phrasing make the text choppy and difficult to follow, failing to convey the fluidity of a podcast. While some technical terms are handled adequately, the cumulative effect of the errors results in a low-quality translation that would be unreliable and frustrating for a native Spanish speaker."
