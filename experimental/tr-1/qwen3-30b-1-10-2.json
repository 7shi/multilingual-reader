    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally easy to follow, with clear sentence structures that facilitate understanding of the technical concepts. The adaptation of complex ideas, such as the analogy of the consultant, is well-handled. The term 'estudiar de último momento' for 'bachoter' is an excellent and clear cultural adaptation that aids readability. Minor grammatical issues like 'Las nuevas conocimientos' and inconsistent address forms (e.g., 'modificas', 'partís') slightly hinder the flow but do not critically impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation exhibits good general fluency, but several issues prevent a higher score. The grammatical error 'Las nuevas conocimientos' (should be 'Los nuevos conocimientos') is a significant flaw. Additionally, there's an inconsistent use of address forms; while most of the dialogue implies 'usted/ustedes', phrases like 'modificas' (tú form) and 'partís' (vosotros form) are used, which creates a noticeable shift in formality and regional dialect that can feel unnatural to a broad Spanish-speaking audience. Phrases like 'Miren mejor' for 'Voyez plutôt' also sound a bit literal and could be smoother.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are appropriately translated and consistent with standard Spanish usage in the field (e.g., 'pre-entrenamiento', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto', 'anclaje'). However, there is an inconsistency in the translation of 'l'affinage'. It is initially presented as the English term 'fine-tuning' (in quotes), but later correctly translated to the Spanish 'ajuste fino'. For a podcast aiming to 'decipher' technology, consistent use of the Spanish equivalent would be preferable.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation successfully maintains the conversational and explanatory tone of the original podcast. The intent and purpose of explaining complex AI concepts in an accessible manner are well-conveyed. The analogy of 'estudiar de último momento para un examen' for 'bachoter' is a particularly strong contextual and cultural adaptation, making the concept immediately relatable to the target audience. The consultant analogy is also well-preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French text has been accurately transferred to the Spanish translation without any omissions or unwarranted additions. The explanations and concepts are complete, ensuring that the target audience receives the full scope of the discussion.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation effectively conveys the core technical concepts of AI learning within a podcast context, demonstrating strong points in contextual adaptation and information completeness. The conversational tone is largely preserved, and excellent choices were made for certain colloquialisms. However, the overall quality is somewhat undermined by notable grammatical errors (e.g., 'Las nuevas conocimientos') and inconsistencies in terminology ('fine-tuning' vs 'ajuste fino') and address forms ('usted/ustedes' vs 'tú/vosotros'), which detract from the fluency and naturalness for a global Spanish audience. Addressing these issues would significantly enhance the translation's polish and professionalism."
