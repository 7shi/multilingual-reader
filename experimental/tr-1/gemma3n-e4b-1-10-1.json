    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "While most of the text is understandable, several grammatical errors (gender agreement, missing punctuation, extra spaces before question marks, typos like 'alasiento' instead of 'al asiento') hinder smooth reading. Crucially, a full segment of a sentence from the original French source is copied verbatim into the Spanish translation, rendering that part completely unreadable and incomprehensible for a Spanish speaker. This is a significant flaw.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation suffers from awkward phrasing and grammatical errors that prevent it from sounding natural to a native Spanish speaker. Examples include mixing French and Spanish in the greeting ('¡Bonjour y bienvenido/a'), literal translations ('C'est a decir?' instead of '¿Es decir?'), inconsistent use of address forms ('tú', 'usted', 'vuestra'), and errors in agreement ('asombrosamente poco información nueva' should be 'asombrosamente poca información nueva'). The untranslated French sentence is the most severe fluency issue.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The technical terms are handled appropriately and consistently throughout the translation. Terms like 'pre-entrenamiento', 'ajuste fino' (fine-tuning), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto', 'anclaje', and 'prompt' are correctly translated or transliterated, and their usage is accurate within the context of AI discussion. The conceptual translation of 'bachotage' as 'estudiar solo para un examen' and 'antisèche' as 'libreta de trucos' also demonstrates good contextual understanding of the specialized vocabulary.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent of explaining complex AI concepts in an accessible podcast format is largely preserved. However, the translation fails in several aspects of contextual adaptation. The opening 'Bonjour' should be fully localized. More critically, a significant portion of Camille's dialogue, specifically the sentence 'como la « Mémoire » que certaines IA commencent à intégrer ? On a l'impression qu'elles commencent vraiment à se souvenir des choses d'una sesión a la otra.', contains untranslated French text, which is a major oversight and completely breaks the flow and context for a Spanish audience. The inconsistent use of 'tú', 'usted', and 'vosotros' pronouns also detracts from a unified and naturally adapted tone for the target audience.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "While the majority of the information from the original text is present, the critical error of leaving a substantial portion of a sentence untranslated in Camille's dialogue means that the information conveyed in that specific segment is incomplete and inaccessible to a Spanish reader. This omission impacts the overall completeness of the translation.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a good grasp of technical terminology, accurately translating and maintaining key AI-related concepts. However, its overall quality is severely compromised by significant issues in readability, fluency, and contextual adaptation. The presence of multiple grammatical errors, inconsistent pronoun usage, and, most notably, a substantial segment of the original French text being left untranslated within the Spanish output, make the text unnatural, difficult to read in places, and incomplete. For a podcast transcript, these issues would significantly hinder the listener's understanding and engagement."
