    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The provided 'translation' consists solely of speaker labels and ellipses, with no actual content translated from the original French. Therefore, it is completely unreadable and incomprehensible as a translation.",

      "reasoning": "Since there is no actual content translated, there are no sentences or phrases to evaluate for naturalness or fluency. The repeated 'ExactExact...' is nonsensical and not fluent.",

      "reasoning": "No technical terms from the original text (e.g., 'pré-entraînement', 'affinage', 'apprentissage par transfert', 'fenêtre de contexte', 'apprentissage en contexte', 'ancrage') have been translated or presented. The 'translation' is devoid of any terminology.",
