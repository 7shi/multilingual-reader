    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is largely unreadable and incomprehensible. Significant portions of the original French dialogue are missing and replaced by fragmented phrases, untranslated English words, and internal processing notes from the translation model. This makes it impossible to follow the conversation or understand the concepts being discussed, as the logical flow is completely broken.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text is completely unnatural and lacks any semblance of fluency. The presence of numerous omissions, isolated words, and internal model notes prevents it from reading like a natural Spanish text. It's a jumble of disjointed elements rather than a coherent conversation.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While some technical terms like 'pre-entrenamiento' and 'ajuste fino' are correctly translated, their usage is inconsistent (e.g., 'fine-tuning' is later left in English) or presented in fragments. Key terms like 'grounding' and 'window of discussion' are left untranslated. The overall fragmented nature of the text makes it impossible to assess if explanations were provided when necessary or if term selection was consistently appropriate.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The core intent and purpose of the original text, which is a coherent and informative podcast dialogue, are entirely lost. The conversational tone and the natural back-and-forth between speakers are absent due to the extensive omissions and malformed output. The translation fails to convey the original context effectively.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This is the most critical failure point. A significant amount of important information from the original text is omitted. Entire sentences and paragraphs of dialogue from both Camille and Luc are missing, replaced by single words, short phrases, or internal processing notes. This results in an extremely incomplete and uninformative translation.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is critically flawed. It is not a functional translation but rather a severely incomplete and corrupted output. Large portions of the original French text are missing, replaced by fragments, untranslated words, and internal model comments. This renders the 'translation' incomprehensible and unusable as a representation of the source material. It fails to meet basic standards of accuracy, completeness, readability, and fluency."
