    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The readability is severely impacted by numerous omissions of full sentences or significant parts of sentences. This makes the dialogue fragmented and hard to follow, as key ideas and explanations are abruptly cut off. Additionally, grammatical errors such as 'inmensas conocimientos' (should be 'inmensos') and 'las informaciones' (should be 'la información') further hinder smooth reading. The inconsistent verb tense, like 'Olvidó todo' (past tense) when 'Olvida todo' (present tense) is expected, also detracts from readability. The inclusion of non-JSON comments and formatting within the output also indicates a failure to produce a clean, parseable JSON as requested.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The fluency is heavily compromised due to the extensive truncation of dialogue turns. The constant missing segments create an unnatural and disjointed flow, making the conversation sound extremely choppy. While some individual phrases and sentences that *are* translated correctly demonstrate a decent grasp of natural Spanish phrasing, these are overshadowed by the overall lack of coherence. The grammatical errors mentioned in readability also contribute to a less natural sound.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally handles technical terminology well. Terms like 'pre-entrenamiento', 'afinamiento' / 'ajuste fino', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto', and 'anclaje' are appropriately translated and consistently used. The inclusion of 'fine-tuning' and 'grounding' in parentheses is helpful and accurate. While 'refina' for 'affinée par' could be more precisely translated as 'se ajusta' or 'se entrena' in the context of AI models, it is still understandable.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "While the parts that are translated correctly manage to convey the casual, conversational tone of a podcast, the severe omissions mean that the full context and intent of many dialogue exchanges are lost. Key explanations, analogies, and the concluding question from the original are missing, preventing the translation from fully adapting and conveying the complete narrative and purpose of the discussion. The overall message about AI learning types is fragmented.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Information completeness is the weakest aspect of this translation. Numerous critical pieces of information, including entire sentences and significant portions of dialogue, are completely omitted. For example, Camille's opening thought about AI being 'black boxes', Luc's detailed explanation of why pre-training leads to expertise, the full analogy about learning to ride a bike, and Camille's concluding 'big question' are all missing. This results in a highly incomplete and unfaithful rendition of the original content. Additionally, extraneous comments and formatting are included in the output, violating instructions.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation suffers from major issues, primarily a severe lack of information completeness. Large portions of the original French dialogue are either completely missing or significantly truncated, rendering the Spanish output fragmented and difficult to understand as a coherent conversation. This directly impacts readability, fluency, and contextual adaptation. While technical terminology is generally handled competently in the translated segments, the pervasive omissions and occasional grammatical errors severely detract from the overall quality. Furthermore, the inclusion of comments and non-JSON text within the generated response indicates a failure to adhere to the specified output format."
