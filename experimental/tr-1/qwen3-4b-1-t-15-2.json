    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally understandable, but frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent use of technical terms disrupt the flow and make it less easy to read. Some sentences require re-reading to fully grasp the intended meaning, reducing overall clarity.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation often sounds unnatural and literal, failing to capture the natural rhythm and common expressions of Spanish. Issues include incorrect prepositions (e.g., 'bienvenido en' instead of 'bienvenido a'), awkward verb conjugations ('Léase' instead of 'Lee' or 'Se le lee'), and word order that feels directly translated from French. Vocabulary choices are sometimes imprecise (e.g., 'afinamiento' for fine-tuning) or inconsistent.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Some technical terms are translated correctly and consistently, such as 'aprendizaje por transferencia' and 'ventana de contexto'. However, there is inconsistency with 'pré-entraînement' (translated as 'preentrenamiento' then 'entrenamiento previo'). More significantly, 'affinage' is translated as 'afinamiento', which is less common in the AI context than 'ajuste fino' or 'sintonización fina'. The expansion of ICL as 'Aprendizaje en contexto' is repetitive given the preceding text. The term 'anclaje' for 'grounding' is acceptable but could be more precise with 'fundamentación' in some AI contexts. The original's parenthetical 'fine-tuning' and 'grounding' were sometimes omitted in the translation, which could reduce clarity for some readers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely conveys the original text's intent and purpose, maintaining the podcast format. There are no significant cultural missteps. However, the overall lack of fluency and naturalness means it doesn't fully 'adapt' to sound like a native Spanish tech podcast. The slightly inconsistent use of 'usted' vs. 'ustedes' at the end also detracts from the conversational tone.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French text appears to be present in the Spanish translation. There are no notable omissions or additions that alter the core message. The content remains concise and clear in terms of information delivery, despite other quality issues.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully conveys the core information and technical concepts discussed in the podcast. However, it is significantly hampered by numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent terminology. These issues lead to a lack of naturalness and fluency, making the text less readable and engaging for a native Spanish speaker. While comprehensible, the translation would greatly benefit from a thorough review to improve sentence structure, verb conjugations, preposition usage, and the selection of more standard AI terminology in Spanish, particularly for 'fine-tuning' and 'pre-training'."
