    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation suffers from several critical errors that significantly hinder readability. Phrases like \"se ataque a la mecánica cuántica\" (instead of \"se adentre en\"), \"Es todo así\" (for \"C'est tout à fait ça\"), and especially \"es el bacheo\" (for \"c'est du bachotage\") are either grammatically incorrect, unnatural, or completely nonsensical, making the text confusing and difficult to follow in key explanatory sections. The flow is often disrupted by these awkward constructions.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation frequently uses literal translations (calques) from French, leading to stiff and unnatural phrasing. Examples include \"bienvenido en\" (should be \"bienvenido a\"), \"es allí donde interviene\" (for \"c'est là qu'intervient\"), and \"en los fondos\" (for \"en coulisses\"). There are also several grammatical agreement errors, such as \"las informaciones\" (should be \"la información\"), \"La IA no se afinan\" (should be \"no se afina\"), and \"estos herramientas\" (should be \"estas herramientas\"). The inconsistent use of formal (usted) and informal (tú) address also detracts from the overall naturalness.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While some technical terms like \"preentrenamiento\" and \"afinado\" (with 'fine-tuning' in parenthesis) are correctly translated, there are significant failures with others. \"Réapprendre\" is mistranslated as \"repasar\" (to review instead of to relearn), subtly altering the meaning. Crucially, \"bachoter\" (cramming) is rendered as \"bacheo\", which means 'pothole patching' and is completely incorrect, severely undermining the analogy. The analogy's supporting term \"antisèche\" (cheat sheet) is also left untranslated. The parenthetical \"(grounding)\" is omitted for \"ancrage\", which would have been helpful for clarity given the technical nature.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to convey the original intent, but its effectiveness is severely limited by the issues in fluency, readability, and terminology. The critical misinterpretation of the 'cramming' analogy (\"bachotage\" to \"bacheo\") means the educational and illustrative purpose of that section is entirely lost. The inconsistent formality (alternating between 'usted' and 'tú') shows a lack of consistent adaptation to a specific audience tone. The overall tone, which should be informative and engaging, is compromised by the awkward phrasing.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major pieces of information from the source text are present in the translation, with no significant omissions of sentences or concepts. However, the severe mistranslations of key analogies and terms (like 'bachoter'/'bacheo') mean that while the words are present, the *meaning* and *clarity* of that information are significantly distorted or lost. The omission of the parenthetical '(grounding)' is a minor completeness issue for supplementary information.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely understandable but contains numerous grammatical errors, literal translations from French, and critical mistranslations of key concepts and analogies. While it covers the content, the frequent awkward phrasing and nonsensical terms (e.g., 'bacheo' for 'cramming') significantly undermine its readability, fluency, and overall quality. It fails to convey the natural, clear, and informative tone of the original podcast."
