    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is severely incomplete, with most of the original text either missing or represented by '...'. Only the opening lines and one specific question from Camille are translated. This makes the text largely unreadable and incomprehensible as a whole.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Due to the extreme incompleteness, fluency cannot be adequately assessed for the majority of the text. The few translated phrases at the beginning are grammatically correct and flow naturally. However, the presence of '...' for most dialogues and the isolated 'Cuando cuando' without context severely hinder overall fluency and naturalness.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all technical terms present in the original French text (e.g., 'pré-entraînement', 'affinage', 'apprentissage par transfert', 'fenêtre de contexte', 'apprentissage en contexte', 'ancrage') are completely absent from the Spanish translation, either due to omission or the use of '...'. Therefore, their appropriate handling cannot be evaluated.",

    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is so incomplete that it utterly fails to convey the original text's intent, purpose, or any meaningful dialogue about AI learning processes. There is no content to adapt contextually or culturally.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is nearly empty, omitting almost all information, explanations, and dialogue from the original French text. It fails to convey any significant portion of the original content, making it entirely incomplete.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation is almost entirely blank and represents a near-total failure. The vast majority of the original text's content is missing, rendering the translation completely unusable and incomprehensible. None of the evaluation criteria can be met due to the lack of translated content."
