    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is almost entirely empty. Only one sentence is present, making the overall text incomprehensible for any reader. No complex concepts are explained clearly because they are simply not translated.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "With only one sentence translated, the text as a whole does not sound natural or smooth. The complete lack of content means there is no flow or coherence. While the single translated sentence itself is grammatically correct, it cannot carry the weight of the entire text's fluency.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The one translated term, 'affinage' as 'ajuste fino', is appropriate. However, this is the only technical term present in the translation, making it impossible to assess consistency, handling of other terms, or explanations of complex terms.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The single translated sentence ('¿Los conocimientos derivados del ajuste fino permanecen en todas las conversaciones para siempre?') correctly conveys the original intent and fits the context. However, this is an isolated instance and does not reflect the entire text's contextual adaptation, which is largely missing.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is severely incomplete. Almost all information from the original text has been omitted. Only one sentence is present, which means the vast majority of the conversation's content is missing.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation is critically incomplete. Only one sentence from the entire dialogue has been translated, rendering it unusable and impossible to evaluate accurately for most criteria. The almost complete omission of content makes it a non-functional translation."
