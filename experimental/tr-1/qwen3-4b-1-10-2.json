    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation presents several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings (e.g., \"bienvenido en\" instead of \"bienvenidos a\", \"poco información\" instead of \"poca información\", \"las conocimientos\" instead of \"los conocimientos\"). A critical sentence (Camille's last question before Luc's explanation on 'Memory') is completely garbled, rendering a significant part of the text unintelligible. The inconsistent use of 'usted' and 'tú' also detracts from readability.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text frequently sounds unnatural and too literal for a native Spanish speaker. Many idiomatic expressions or common turns of phrase are translated word-for-word, which results in clunky or incorrect Spanish (e.g., \"se ataque a\" for \"s'attaque à\", \"en vía de aparecer\" for \"en train d'émerger\", \"bachear\" for \"bachoter\"). This makes the conversation less smooth and engaging than the original.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While some technical terms are handled correctly (e.g., \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\"), others are not the most standard or are outright incorrect within the AI domain. \"Afinamiento\" for \"fine-tuning\" is less common than \"ajuste fino\" or \"sintonización fina\". Crucially, \"sosténance\" for \"grounding\" is an incorrect or highly unusual term in Spanish AI contexts, and the translation of \"antisèche\" as \"antelación\" completely misses the mark.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent of the original text is generally conveyed, but the conversational and explanatory tone is undermined by the stiffness, grammatical errors, and unnatural phrasing in the Spanish translation. The significant mistranslation of key concepts like 'cramming' ('bachoter' to 'bachear') and 'cheat sheet' ('antisèche' to 'antelación') leads to a loss of the original's communicative effectiveness and clarity in its analogies.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The most significant issue is the complete garbling of one of Camille's key questions about the 'Memory' feature, which means a substantial piece of information from the original text is missing from the target output. While most other sentences retain their core information, the mistranslation of specific terms also leads to subtle losses or distortions of meaning.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation attempts to convey the core concepts of the original podcast but is significantly hampered by consistent grammatical errors, unnatural phrasing, and inconsistent address (usted/tú). A major deficiency is the garbled translation of a critical sentence, which severely impacts information completeness and overall readability. Key technical terms are sometimes inaccurately or unnaturally translated, detracting from the text's professional and educational value. The translation requires extensive revision to achieve accuracy, fluency, and naturalness for a Spanish-speaking audience."
