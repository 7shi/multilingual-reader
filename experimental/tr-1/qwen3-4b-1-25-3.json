    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation suffers from several awkward sentence structures and literal translations that hinder natural reading. For example, 'es ahí donde se interviene 'aprendizaje por transferencia'?' is grammatically clumsy. The repetition of 'Ella olvida todo' and the untranslated 'Cuando fine-tunes un modelo' significantly break the flow. Punctuation spacing is also incorrect in several places (e.g., before '!', '?'). These issues make the text less smooth and at times require re-reading to fully grasp the meaning.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains numerous instances of unnatural phrasing and grammatical errors that would sound awkward to a native Spanish speaker. Examples include: 'la forma en que... aprenden y se vuelven tan inteligentes' (could be smoother), 'se interviene 'aprendizaje por transferencia'' (incorrect verb usage), 'Ella olvida todo. Ella olvida todo.' (redundant and unnatural in dialogue), 'Los conocimientos... La IA las utiliza' (incorrect gender for 'las'), 'Cuando fine-tunes un modelo' (English word left untranslated), 'Las nuevas conocimientos' (incorrect gender), 'la IA no tiene ninguna idea de lo que se dijo antes' (could be 'no tiene ni idea' or 'no recuerda nada'), 'La IA no se afinan constantemente' (incorrect verb conjugation), 'le dimos solo una anticipe' (incorrect word and gender), and 'estos herramientas' (incorrect gender). The choice of 'aplastar' for 'bachoter' (cramming) is also highly inappropriate and changes the meaning.",

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While some technical terms like 'aprendizaje por transferencia,' 'ventana de contexto,' and 'aprendizaje en contexto' are correctly translated, there are significant issues. 'Pré-entraînement' is left in French once, then translated as 'preentrenamiento' later, showing inconsistency. 'Afinamiento' for 'fine-tuning' is acceptable but 'ajuste fino' is more common. The most critical error is leaving 'fine-tunes' untranslated within a Spanish sentence. The translation of 'bachoter' as 'aplastar' is incorrect and misrepresents the concept of 'cramming'. Similarly, 'antisèche' as 'anticipe' is incorrect; 'chuleta' or 'apunte' would be more appropriate.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text is a dialogue from a podcast, implying a conversational, engaging, and clear tone. The translation, however, frequently breaks this tone due to its grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and unnatural word choices. The analogy of 'bachoter' (cramming) loses its impact and clarity because the chosen Spanish term 'aplastar' does not convey the same meaning. While the overall structure of the dialogue is maintained, the delivery makes it less engaging and harder to follow than the original, failing to fully adapt to the conversational context.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key information from the original French text appears to be present in the Spanish translation. No significant omissions or additions were found. However, the clarity and accuracy with which some information is conveyed suffer due to poor terminology choices and grammatical errors, which could indirectly affect the reader's full understanding of certain concepts (e.g., the explanation of 'cramming'). Despite this, the explicit information is retained.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation attempts to convey all information from the source text but suffers from significant issues in fluency, readability, and terminology. Numerous grammatical errors, unnatural phrasing, inconsistent term usage, and the direct omission of translation for some technical terms (e.g., 'fine-tunes') severely detract from the overall quality. While the core concepts are present, the delivery makes the text less engaging and at times difficult to follow, especially for a podcast transcript that should sound natural and conversational. A thorough review by a native Spanish speaker with expertise in AI terminology is needed to significantly improve the quality."
