    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally understandable, but frequent missing opening question marks, some clunky literal translations (e.g., \"Eso es exactamente eso\"), and a grammatical error (\"para dársela una cultura general\" instead of \"para darle\") slightly hinder the flow and clarity for a native speaker. The duplicated speaker tag \"Camille: Camille:\" also disrupts reading.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While largely fluent, the presence of grammatical errors (e.g., \"para dársela\"), the repeated use of subject pronouns where they are naturally omitted in Spanish (\"Ella lee\", \"Él transfiere\"), and slightly unnatural literal translations (\"Eso es exactamente eso\") detract from its naturalness. The inconsistent translation of \"fine-tuning\" also affects consistency of flow.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms like \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", and \"anclaje\" are correctly translated. However, the consistent initial choice of \"afinamiento\" for \"fine-tuning\" is suboptimal (more natural options are \"ajuste fino\" or \"refinamiento\"). The later use of \"refinamiento\" creates inconsistency. Also, \"ficha\" is not the best equivalent for \"antisèche\" (cheat sheet); \"chuleta\" or \"hoja de trucos\" would be more accurate.",

    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall tone and purpose of a tech podcast dialogue are well-maintained, with language that is generally appropriate for a conversational setting. Idiomatic expressions are mostly handled effectively (e.g., \"desmenuzamos\", \"entra en juego\", \"en segundo plano\"). The adaptation of the name Camille to Camila is a minor, acceptable choice.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French text is present in the Spanish translation. No significant omissions or extraneous additions were found, and all core concepts and examples were fully conveyed.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely accurate and effectively conveys the core technical concepts and the conversational tone of the podcast. It is generally understandable to a Spanish-speaking audience. However, its quality is diminished by several minor grammatical errors, particularly missing opening question marks, and occasional clunky, overly literal phrasing that impacts naturalness and fluency. The inconsistent and sometimes suboptimal choice of terminology for 'fine-tuning' is also a notable area for improvement. Despite these issues, the key information is complete and the meaning is preserved."
