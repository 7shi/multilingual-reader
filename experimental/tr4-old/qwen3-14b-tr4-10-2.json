    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally easy to follow and understand. Sentence structures are clear and logical, making the flow of conversation natural for a podcast transcript. Complex concepts are broken down effectively, mirroring the original's approach.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation, while accurate, occasionally suffers from unnatural phrasing and overly literal translations from French that do not sound entirely idiomatic in Spanish. Examples include 'el afinamiento' instead of 'ajuste fino', 'bachotaje' for 'cramming', 'se acuerda' instead of 'recuerda', and some awkward agreements like 'Las conocimientos' (should be 'Los conocimientos'). Some sentences feel slightly clunky due to direct translation rather than rephrasing for natural Spanish flow.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms like 'preentrenamiento,' 'aprendizaje por transferencia,' 'ventana de contexto,' and 'anclaje' are translated correctly and are standard in the field. However, 'afinamiento' for 'fine-tuning' is not the most common or natural term in Spanish AI/ML contexts ('ajuste fino' or 'sintonización fina' are preferred). Additionally, 'bachotaje' is a very literal translation for 'bachotage' (cramming) and is not widely understood or used in Spanish for this concept, impacting clarity.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational tone of the original podcast is successfully maintained. The use of analogies is well-preserved, which aids in explaining complex AI concepts to a general audience. The interaction between Camille and Luc feels authentic, and the overall intent of the original text—to demystify AI learning processes—is effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original text is accurately conveyed in the translation without any omissions. The explanations of complex AI concepts are complete and clear, and the distinctions between different learning methods are fully preserved. There is no unnecessary redundancy or missing details.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation effectively conveys the core technical information and maintains the conversational tone of the original podcast. However, its overall quality is hampered by several instances of less natural phrasing and suboptimal vocabulary choices (e.g., 'afinamiento' for fine-tuning, 'bachotaje' for cramming), which detract from its fluency and readability for a native Spanish speaker. While the information is complete and mostly accurate, improvements in idiomatic expression and standard technical terminology would significantly enhance the translation's quality."
