    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally clear and easy to follow, with logical sentence structures. Readers can understand the concepts presented. However, minor awkward phrasing (\"Es por eso una memoria de un solo uso\") and the mistranslation of \"bachoter\" to \"bachatear\" (which carries a different meaning in Spanish, related to dance, rather than \"to cram\") slightly hinder perfect readability in those specific instances.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While much of the text flows naturally, several instances prevent it from achieving full fluency. Grammatical agreements (e.g., \"inmensas conocimientos\" should be \"inmensos conocimientos\"), omitted dialogue creating abrupt transitions, and less natural preposition usage (\"afinándose con\") stand out. The decision to retain \"antisèche\" verbatim, instead of translating it to a common Spanish equivalent like \"chuleta\" or \"apunte,\" significantly detracts from naturalness for a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The translation handles most core technical terms (\"pre-entrenamiento,\" \"ajuste fino,\" \"aprendizaje por transferencia,\" \"ventana de contexto,\" \"aprendizaje en contexto,\" \"anclaje\") accurately and consistently, often helpfully including the English original in parentheses. This demonstrates a good understanding of the domain. However, the mistranslation of \"bachoter\" to \"bachatear\" (meaning to dance bachata, not to cram for an exam) is a significant terminology error. Similarly, \"antisèche\" should have been translated to a Spanish equivalent. These two specific instances prevent a higher score, as they represent fundamental misunderstandings of common idioms in the context.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely maintains the informative and conversational tone appropriate for a podcast. The analogies from the original text (e.g., AI as a student/consultant) are effectively carried over. The intent and purpose of explaining AI learning processes are clearly conveyed. However, the retention of \"antisèche\" and the inappropriate translation of \"bachoter\" (\"bachatear\" refers to a dance style in Spanish, not cramming for an exam) demonstrate a lack of adaptation to common Spanish idioms and cultural context, slightly diminishing the naturalness for the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation suffers from notable omissions of content from the source text. Specifically, one instance of Luc's repeated phrase \"Elle oublie tout\" and his complete concluding sentence \"C'est la manière idéale de poser le problème\" are missing. These are not minor stylistic changes but direct removals of dialogue, which compromise the completeness of the information and the natural flow of the conversation.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is generally competent in conveying the core message and most technical terms accurately. However, several significant issues, particularly in fluency, precise terminology for colloquialisms (\"bachoter,\" \"antisèche\"), and crucially, the direct omission of certain lines of dialogue, prevent it from being a high-quality translation. It's understandable but needs refinement for naturalness and completeness to fully capture the essence and detail of the original podcast."
