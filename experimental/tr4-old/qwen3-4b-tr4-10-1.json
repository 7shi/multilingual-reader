    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "While most of the text is understandable, several grammatical errors (e.g., \"le darle\", \"se recuerda\", gender agreements) and awkward phrasing (e.g., \"Ella lee\", \"Yo veo\") hinder the natural flow. The incorrect translation of \"antisèche\" to \"antiesca\" creates a significant point of confusion, and the frequent omission of opening question marks affects standard Spanish punctuation, making it less easy to read.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation frequently lacks naturalness due to direct literal translations from French, awkward grammatical constructions (\"le darle\" instead of \"darle\", \"se recuerda\" instead of \"recuerda\", repetitive use of \"Ella\" for AI), and inconsistent address forms (switching between \"usted\" and \"ustedes\"). Vocabulary choices like \"bachotaje\" (for cramming) and \"astucia\" (for trick/tip) are not the most natural or accurate. The use of \"antiesca\" is a severe fluency detractor.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms like \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\", and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly translated. However, there is inconsistency in translating \"affinage\" (using both \"afinamiento\" and retaining \"fine-tuning\"). More critically, \"astucia\" for \"astuce\" is an incorrect choice in context, and \"antiesca\" for \"antisèche\" is a completely wrong and non-existent term in Spanish for a \"cheat sheet\", which is a major terminology failure.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and purpose of explaining AI learning processes are effectively conveyed. Analogies, such as the university graduate or learning to ride a bike, are adequately transferred. There are no significant cultural missteps, as the content is largely technical. However, some awkward phrasing and incorrect word choices slightly detract from optimal contextual flow and impact the conversational tone of a podcast.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original text appears to be conveyed without omission. There are no notable redundancies introduced. The core concepts are present, even if some specific word choices or grammatical structures are poor. The misunderstanding caused by terms like \"antiesca\" is a clarity issue rather than an omission of information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation accurately conveys most of the information from the original French podcast transcript into Spanish. However, it suffers from significant grammatical errors, unnatural phrasing, and critical lexical mistakes, particularly with non-technical vocabulary (e.g., \"antisèche\" to \"antiesca\"). While understandable, it frequently lacks the fluency and polish expected of a professional translation, impacting overall readability and naturalness for a native Spanish speaker. Consistency in terminology and grammatical forms (like subject pronouns and gender agreement) would greatly improve the quality."
