    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally understandable, and sentence structures are mostly logical. However, recurring grammatical errors, such as the incorrect use of 'se recuerda' instead of 'recuerda', agreement errors like 'esas conocimientos' instead of 'esos conocimientos', and missing opening question marks, slightly hinder the overall readability and create minor pauses for the reader.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation struggles with naturalness in several places. The most significant issues are the inconsistent and often incorrect translation of 'affinage' (fine-tuning) as 'afianzamiento' or 'el afinar' instead of the standard 'afinamiento' or 'ajuste fino'. The phrasing 'Eso es precisamente eso' for 'C'est tout à fait ça' sounds clunky. The crucial error 'se nos ha proporcionado' instead of 'se le ha proporcionado' changes the subject of the action, creating a jarring effect and misrepresenting the original meaning. These issues make the text sound less native and fluent.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "This is the weakest aspect of the translation. The term 'affinage' (fine-tuning) is inconsistently and incorrectly translated as 'afianzamiento' and 'el afinar'. While 'afinando' is later used correctly for the verb form, the noun forms are wrong, creating significant confusion for a technical audience. 'Ancrage' (grounding) is translated as 'ancrado' instead of the more appropriate 'anclaje' or 'fundamentación'. 'Antisèche' (crib sheet) is translated as 'pista' (hint/clue), which loses the precise meaning of being 'fed' information directly. Lastly, the podcast title changes from 'Tech Destellos' at the beginning to 'Tech Enfoque' at the end, indicating an inconsistency in branding.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely maintains the conversational and informative tone of a podcast. The shift from formal 'vous' to informal 'tú' is handled well. However, the misinterpretation of technical terms and the key grammatical error regarding the pronoun ('se nos' vs 'se le') for 'antisèche' affect the precise conveyance of the original intent and analogies. The inconsistent podcast title also detracts from a cohesive brand identity, which is part of contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the core information from the original text is present. However, the nuanced meaning of certain concepts is diminished due to the inappropriate technical terminology. The translation of 'antisèche' as 'pista' reduces the specificity of the analogy. Critically, the pronoun error 'se nos ha proporcionado una pista' instead of 'se le ha proporcionado una pista' factually misrepresents who receives the information, which is a significant information distortion, even if other parts are complete.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation provides a general understanding of the original content but is significantly hampered by consistent issues in technical terminology, grammatical errors, and awkward phrasing. Key AI concepts like 'fine-tuning' and 'grounding' are mistranslated or inconsistently rendered, which would confuse a technically-minded audience. While the overall flow is present, the lack of precision, naturalness, and consistency prevents it from being a high-quality translation suitable for a professional technical podcast."
