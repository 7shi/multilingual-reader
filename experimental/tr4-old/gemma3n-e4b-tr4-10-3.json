    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The presence of an entire paragraph in French within the Spanish translation renders a significant portion of the text incomprehensible for a Spanish speaker. Additionally, a few untranslated French interjections (\"D'accord\") and a mistranslation (\"Vean plut√¥t\" instead of \"Miren\" or \"Vean ustedes\") further hinder readability.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The most critical issue is the large segment of untranslated French text, which completely breaks the flow and naturalness of the Spanish. Beyond this, minor issues like the unnatural \"Bonjour y bienvenido\" (instead of \"Hola y bienvenido\") and grammatical errors (\"una forma astucia\" instead of \"una forma astuta\") detract from the overall fluency.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While several technical terms like \"pre-entrenamiento\" and \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" were correctly translated or glossed, the complete failure to translate a key paragraph discussing \"ICL\" and \"affinage\" means that important technical explanations and terms are left in the source language, making them inaccessible and inconsistent for the target audience.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent of explaining AI concepts in a podcast format is partially conveyed where the text is correctly translated. However, the untranslated French paragraph severely disrupts the educational purpose and makes it impossible for the target audience to follow the detailed explanation of core concepts. The presence of direct French phrases like \"D'accord\" also shows a lack of adaptation.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A substantial and critically important paragraph detailing the difference between \"In-Context Learning\" (ICL) and \"Fine-tuning\" is completely omitted from the Spanish translation, as it is left in French. This represents a major failure in conveying essential information from the original text, directly impacting the core understanding of the topic.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation suffers from a critical flaw: a large, pivotal paragraph detailing the core differences between In-Context Learning and Fine-tuning has been left entirely in French. This singular error severely impacts readability, fluency, and information completeness, making the translation unusable for a Spanish-speaking audience in that section. While some other parts of the translation are acceptable, minor grammatical issues and unnatural phrasing also appear. The presence of untranslated French interjections further detracts from the quality. This translation requires significant revision, primarily addressing the untranslated content."
