  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The readability is severely impacted by several instances where French text is directly copied into the Spanish translation, making large portions of the dialogue incomprehensible to a Spanish speaker. Specifically, 'Vean plutôt', 'D'accord.', and an entire paragraph from Luc's dialogue remain in French. Additionally, there are grammatical errors (e.g., 'astucia' instead of 'astuta') and inconsistent address forms ('tus' vs. 'vuestras') that hinder the flow.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation lacks fluency due to the untranslated French segments, which disrupt the natural rhythm and flow of the Spanish text. The direct copy-pasting of French phrases is a major detractor. While some translated sentences are natural, errors like 'Eso es exactamente' (missing 'así' or 'lo que ocurre') and the incorrect gender agreement ('astucia' instead of 'astuta') further reduce naturalness. The inconsistent use of 'tú' and 'vosotros' forms also makes the dialogue less smooth.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "When technical terms are translated, they are generally handled well and consistently (e.g., 'pre-entrenamiento', 'ajuste fino', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'anclaje'). The choice to include both the English and Spanish terms for 'fine-tuning' is also a good practice. However, the presence of untranslated French paragraphs, which contain technical discussions, significantly impacts the overall appropriate use of terminology, as crucial terms within those sections are not rendered in Spanish.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text's intent and purpose, as a podcast dialogue explaining AI concepts, are largely lost due to the significant omissions and untranslated segments. The speaker attribution error ('Luc: Entonces, él transfiere...' when it should be Camille) also disrupts the conversational context. While the analogies and general tone are maintained in the translated parts, the overall broken nature of the text prevents effective conveyance of the message.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This criterion is critically failed. There are major omissions where significant portions of the French text are left completely untranslated in the Spanish version. These include 'Vean plutôt', 'D'accord.', and most notably, an entire explanatory paragraph from Luc's dialogue about ICL and fine-tuning. Additionally, a line from Camille is incorrectly attributed to Luc. This results in a massive loss of information and severely compromises the understanding of the concepts discussed.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation exhibits critical flaws, primarily due to large sections of the original French text being left untranslated. This makes the Spanish text incomplete, incoherent, and largely unreadable in key parts. Beyond these major omissions, there are also grammatical errors, inconsistencies in addressing the audience, and a speaker attribution mistake. While some individual technical terms are handled correctly where translated, the pervasive nature of the untranslated content drastically diminishes the overall quality, rendering the output mostly unusable."
