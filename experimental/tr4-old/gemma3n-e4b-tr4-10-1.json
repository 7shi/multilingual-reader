  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains multiple instances of untranslated French phrases and an entire paragraph left in French, making large sections of the text completely incomprehensible to a Spanish speaker. Examples include 'Bonjour y bienvenido' (should be 'Hola y bienvenido'), 'Vean plutôt:' (should be 'Veamos:' or 'Consideren esto:'), 'D'accord.' (should be 'De acuerdo.'), and the paragraph starting with 'Telle est la réalité de l'ICL.' This represents a fundamental failure in making the content readable.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The presence of untranslated French words and phrases severely disrupts the flow and naturalness of the Spanish text. Grammatical errors such as 'una forma astucia' instead of 'una forma astuta' also detract from fluency. The sudden switch from French to Spanish and back, especially with the completely untranslated paragraph, makes the text feel disjointed and unnatural.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While some technical terms like 'pre-entrenamiento', 'ajuste fino', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', and 'ventana de contexto' are correctly translated or appropriately kept with their English equivalents, the complete omission of a crucial explanatory paragraph means that key terminology and its associated concepts in that section are entirely missing from the Spanish version. Additionally, 'libreta de apuntes' for 'antisèche' (cheat sheet) is a less precise translation, as 'chuleta' or 'acordeón' would be more common and accurate for the intended analogy.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation demonstrates a severe lack of contextual adaptation due to the direct inclusion of French phrases and a full untranslated paragraph. This shows no consideration for the target Spanish audience's linguistic or cultural background. Furthermore, the inconsistent use of pronouns ('tú', 'ustedes', 'vosotros') when addressing the audience, diverging from the consistent 'vous' in the original, indicates poor adaptation to a consistent register or regional Spanish dialect.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A significant portion of the original text, specifically the entire paragraph explaining the core difference between In-Context Learning (ICL) and fine-tuning ('Telle est la réalité de l'ICL. C'est incroyablement flexible, mais basé sur une mémoire à court terme. L'affinage, en revanche, vise à créer une compétence permanente. Lorsque vous affinez un modèle, vous modifiez fondamentalement sa structure interne. Les nouvelles connaissances deviennent partie intégrante de son identité.'), is completely omitted from the Spanish translation. This is a critical failure in conveying important information.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation exhibits fundamental and severe flaws across all evaluated criteria. Large sections of the text remain untranslated, making the content unreadable and incomplete for a Spanish speaker. The presence of direct French phrases, grammatical errors, and inconsistent address forms further compromises fluency and contextual adaptation. While some individual technical terms are handled correctly, the overwhelming presence of errors and omissions renders this translation unusable and indicates a lack of basic translation quality control."
