    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely comprehensible, with clear sentence structures that mostly follow Spanish syntax. However, some minor grammatical errors, such as \"se percibe estas IA\" (should be 'se perciben') and the awkward repetition of \"Ella olvida todo\", reduce the overall smoothness. The critical error of translating \"extraits\" as \"extraños\" instead of \"extractos\" in one sentence significantly hinders readability by introducing a nonsensical word that breaks comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While much of the text flows naturally, several instances prevent it from achieving high fluency. Phrases like \"bienvenida al\" (should be 'bienvenidos'), \"desencriptamos\" (less common than 'desciframos' or 'analizamos' for explaining tech), \"Veamos en cambio\" for 'Voyez plutôt', and \"Eso es por qué\" for 'C'est pourquoi' sound somewhat literal or less idiomatic. The untranslated \"antisèche\" is also a notable break in fluency, as it's a French term not used in Spanish. These instances make the text sound more like a translation than an original Spanish script.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally well-handled. \"Preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are standard and correct. \"Afinamiento\" for 'fine-tuning' is acceptable, though 'ajuste fino' or 'sintonización fina' are arguably more common in the ML context. \"Anclaje\" for 'grounding' is a plausible translation, and the parenthetical English helps clarify it. The consistency in term usage is good throughout. The error 'extraños' is a mistranslation of a non-technical word, not a terminology issue itself.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely maintains the conversational and informative tone of a podcast. The use of 'ustedes' for addressing the audience is appropriate. However, the failure to adapt certain cultural or idiomatic expressions, most notably \"antisèche\" (for 'cheat sheet'), indicates a lack of full contextual adaptation. The major word error, \"extraños\" for \"extraits\", also impacts context by rendering a sentence nonsensical.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the source text appears to be present in the translation, with no significant omissions. However, the critical mistranslation of \"extraits\" as \"extraños\" means that the *correct* information for that specific detail is not conveyed, effectively introducing an error rather than just an omission. Similarly, the untranslated \"antisèche\" means the specific nuance of 'cheat sheet' isn't fully conveyed in Spanish, though the general concept is inferable.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate in conveying the core concepts of the French original, and most technical terms are translated correctly. The dialogue format is maintained well. However, the translation suffers from several instances of awkward phrasing, literal translations, and minor grammatical errors that detract from its naturalness and fluency. A critical mistranslation of 'extraits' as 'extraños' and the non-translation of 'antisèche' are significant issues that affect both readability and the overall quality of the text. While generally understandable, these points prevent it from being a high-quality, polished translation."
