    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is exceptionally clear and easy to follow. Sentence structures are natural, and complex AI concepts are explained in a highly comprehensible manner. The conversational style of the podcast is well-maintained, allowing readers to easily grasp the information.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text flows very naturally in Spanish. There are no awkward grammatical constructions, unnatural expressions, or inappropriate vocabulary choices. The dialogue feels authentic and smooth, consistent with native Spanish speech.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as 'pre-entrenamiento' (pré-entraînement), 'ajuste fino' (affinage - fine-tuning), 'aprendizaje por transferencia' (apprentissage par transfert), 'ventana de contexto' (fenêtre de contexte), 'aprendizaje en contexto' (apprentissage en contexte - ICL), and 'anclaje' (ancrage - grounding) are all translated correctly and used consistently throughout the text. Explanations for these terms are precise and align perfectly with the original meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation effectively conveys the original text's intent and purpose, which is to explain complex AI learning processes in an accessible podcast format. The tone is perfectly preserved, and all analogies (e.g., university graduate, physicist, learning to ride a bike, consultant, cramming for an exam) are adapted seamlessly, making the explanations equally impactful for the Spanish-speaking audience.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original French text is conveyed without any omissions. The distinctions between pre-training, fine-tuning, in-context learning, and the 'Memory' feature are completely and accurately explained. No crucial details are missing, and the content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 20

    "overall_comment": "This is an outstanding translation that demonstrates a deep understanding of both the source and target languages, as well as the technical subject matter. The text is highly fluent, accurate, and remarkably readable, successfully conveying complex AI concepts in an engaging and natural conversational style. It's a prime example of high-quality technical translation."
