    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely easy to read and understand, maintaining the conversational tone of a podcast. The sentence structures are clear and follow logical patterns, making complex AI concepts accessible. However, the consistent omission of opening question marks (¿) and the mistranslation of 'bachotage' to 'bachatear' (a dance style instead of cramming) create minor disruptions in readability and comprehension for a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally flows well and sounds natural to a native speaker. Vocabulary choices are mostly appropriate and contemporary for a tech podcast. Instances like 'está hecha posible' for 'est rendue possible' are slightly less natural than alternatives like 'se hace posible'. The most significant issue affecting fluency is the mistranslation of 'bachotage' to 'bachatear', which is completely out of context and jarring. Also, the lack of proper Spanish punctuation (missing '¿') affects the natural rhythm of reading questions.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms such as 'pre-entrenamiento', 'ajuste fino' (with 'fine-tuning' in parentheses), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto' (ICL), and 'anclaje' (grounding) are correctly translated and consistently applied throughout the text. This is crucial for a technical discussion. The major flaw in terminology is the mistranslation of 'bachotage' (referring to rote learning/cramming for an exam) to 'bachatear' (a dance). This is a significant semantic error in a key conceptual explanation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation successfully conveys the original text's intent and purpose, preserving the engaging and explanatory style of a podcast. The analogies used (university graduate, consultant, learning to ride a bike) are well-adapted and effective in Spanish. The informal 'tú' form is mostly consistent after an initial 'Imaginen', which fits the podcast context. The only minor points of improvement would be a more precise idiomatic translation for 'antisèche' (cheat sheet) and the correct handling of 'bachotage' to fully capture the original nuance and context.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original French text has been conveyed without any noticeable omissions. The explanation of AI learning stages (pre-training, fine-tuning, in-context learning) and their characteristics (temporary vs. permanent knowledge) is complete. No unnecessary redundancy was introduced, keeping the content concise and clear. The core message and details are fully preserved.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of good quality, effectively conveying complex technical information in an accessible and engaging manner, suitable for a podcast. It successfully translates most of the specialized AI terminology correctly. However, the consistent omission of opening question marks (¿) and a significant semantic error in translating 'bachotage' as 'bachatear' (a dance style) detract from an otherwise strong performance. Addressing these punctuation issues and the specific terminology error would significantly enhance the translation's polish and accuracy."
