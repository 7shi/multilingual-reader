    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains high readability. The sentence structures are natural, and the explanations of complex AI concepts are clear and easy for a Spanish speaker to follow, reflecting the original's conversational and informative tone. There are no awkward constructions that hinder understanding.",

    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation demonstrates excellent fluency. The language sounds natural and smooth to a native Spanish speaker, and vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary. The conversational tone is effectively maintained. Minor points for improvement include occasional slight repetitiveness in conversational fillers (\"Exacto\") and some pronoun usage that, while grammatically correct, could sometimes be slightly more idiomatic (\"Ella lee\" instead of \"La IA lee\").",

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled very well. Standard translations like \"pre-entrenamiento,\" \"ajuste fino,\" \"aprendizaje por transferencia,\" \"ventana de contexto,\" and \"anclaje\" are used correctly and consistently. The original English terms are retained in parentheses where appropriate, aiding understanding for a tech-savvy audience. The translation of \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Tech Relámpago\" is also apt.",
