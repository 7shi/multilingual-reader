    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The sentence structure is generally clear and easy to follow. Concepts are explained logically, mirroring the original's progression, making the text mostly understandable for a Spanish speaker. However, the presence of untranslated French technical terms like 'ancrage' and 'antisèche' would hinder full comprehension for a monolingual Spanish audience, despite the surrounding context.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation's naturalness is significantly impacted by the direct adoption of French terms ('ancrage', 'antisèche') which sound foreign and jarring in a Spanish context. These are not common loanwords in Spanish and have direct, common Spanish equivalents. Additionally, there is some slightly awkward pronoun usage ('Ella lee', 'él transfiere') and inconsistent terminology for 'fine-tuning' ('afinamiento', 'afinado', 'ajuste fino'), which detract from the overall flow and naturalness.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "This is the weakest aspect of the translation. The terms 'ancrage' and 'antisèche' are left untranslated from French, which is a critical error as they are not universally understood in Spanish and have standard equivalents ('anclaje' or 'grounding' for the former, 'chuleta' or 'machete' for the latter). There's also inconsistency in the translation of 'pré-entraînement' (sometimes 'pre-entrenamiento', sometimes 'preentrenamiento') and 'affinage' ('afinamiento', 'afinado', 'ajuste fino'), indicating a lack of a consistent terminology strategy. While most other technical terms are handled correctly, these errors are significant.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation successfully conveys the original text's intent and maintains the informal, conversational tone appropriate for a podcast. The analogies used in the source text (e.g., university graduate, consultant, learning to ride a bike, cramming for an exam) are effectively transferred and resonate well within the Spanish context. The dynamic between the speakers, Camille and Luc, is also preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French text is accurately conveyed in the Spanish translation. No significant details are omitted, misinterpreted, or unnecessarily added. The nuances of complex concepts like in-context learning versus fine-tuning, and temporary versus permanent memory, are fully preserved.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation competently conveys the core technical information and maintains the conversational style of the original podcast. However, its quality is notably diminished by critical errors in terminology, specifically the untranslated French terms 'ancrage' and 'antisèche', which are confusing for a Spanish audience. Minor inconsistencies in other technical terms and some slightly unnatural phrasing also affect fluency. While the contextual adaptation and information completeness are strong, the terminology and fluency issues prevent it from being a high-quality translation."
