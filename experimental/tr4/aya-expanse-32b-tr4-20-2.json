    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The core technical concepts are generally well-explained and the sentence structures are mostly logical. However, the inconsistent use of 'tú' and 'usted' (informal vs. formal address) throughout the dialogue significantly detracts from readability. This frequent switching can be jarring and confusing for a native Spanish speaker, forcing them to re-evaluate the intended addressee and interrupting the flow of comprehension.",

    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many phrases and idiomatic expressions, such as 'estudiar de memoria' for 'bachoter', are well-translated and sound natural. However, the inconsistent use of 'tú' and 'usted' is a major issue that makes the dialogue sound highly unnatural and awkward for native speakers. This is a fundamental aspect of Spanish discourse. Additionally, there is a grammatical error where a singular subject 'La IA' is paired with a plural verb 'no se afinan' instead of 'no se afina', further impacting fluency.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms like 'pré-entraînement' (pre-entrenamiento), 'apprentissage par transfert' (aprendizaje por transferencia), 'fenêtre de contexte' (ventana de contexto), and 'apprentissage en contexte' (aprendizaje en contexto) are translated correctly and appropriately. The inclusion of '(fine-tuning)' and '(Aprendizaje en Contexto)' next to the Spanish terms is helpful. The main weakness is the inconsistency in translating 'affinage' as both 'ajuste fino' and 'afinamiento' at different points. While both are understandable, consistency is crucial in technical texts. 'Ficha' for 'antisèche' is acceptable, though a more colloquial term might have better captured the informal nuance.",

    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall conversational tone of the podcast is generally maintained, and the analogies used (e.g., university graduate, physicist, cycling) are effectively conveyed. The title 'Tech Relámpago' is a good adaptation. However, the significant and inconsistent switching between 'tú' and 'usted' addresses fundamentally fails to adapt to the sociolinguistic norms of Spanish in a continuous dialogue. This undermines the intended conversational dynamic and makes the interaction less natural for the target audience.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French text has been accurately transferred to the Spanish translation without any omissions or unwarranted additions. The explanatory addition of '(Aprendizaje en Contexto)' for ICL is a good example of enhancing clarity for the target audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation accurately conveys the technical content and generally maintains the conversational style suitable for a podcast. However, its quality is significantly hampered by pervasive and inconsistent use of 'tú' and 'usted' throughout the dialogue. This fundamental issue creates awkwardness and detracts heavily from the fluency and readability for a native Spanish speaker. There are also minor inconsistencies in terminology and a grammatical error, which, while less severe than the address inconsistency, still impact the overall quality. Addressing the 'tú'/'usted' consistency would dramatically improve the translation."
