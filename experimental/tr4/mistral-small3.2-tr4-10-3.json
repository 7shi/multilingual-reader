    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is clear and easy to follow. Sentence structures are logical and contribute to good comprehension. While there are a few minor instances of less common word usage (\"informaciones\" instead of \"información\") or slightly literal translations from French, they do not significantly impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally flows well, but it occasionally feels stiff or overly literal, directly reflecting the French syntax rather than adopting a more natural Spanish expression. The repetitive use of \"Por lo tanto\" and some less idiomatic phrasing (\"Ella lo olvida todo\" vs. \"Lo olvida todo\") detract from the naturalness. There are also inconsistencies in the use of formal/informal address (usted/tú) and singular/plural audience address (\"Vean\" vs. consistent \"usted\").",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is translated with high accuracy and consistency throughout the text. Terms like \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", and \"anclaje\" are correctly identified and used. The original's inclusion of English equivalents (e.g., fine-tuning, grounding) is also correctly preserved. The only minor point is the translation of \"antisèche\" to \"resumen,\" which loses some of the original's nuance as a 'cheat sheet'.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation effectively conveys the original text's informative yet conversational intent for a podcast. However, there is an inconsistency in addressing the audience, shifting between formal singular (\"usted\"), formal plural (\"Vean\"), and informal singular (\"contigo\" in the final line). This detracts from a fully adapted and consistent user experience. The translation of \"antisèche\" as \"resumen\" also slightly misses the idiomatic and illustrative context of a \"cheat sheet\".",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original text is accurately and completely conveyed in the translation. There are no omissions of key concepts, examples, or dialogue points. The content remains concise and clear without introducing any redundancy or extraneous details.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of good quality, accurately conveying the technical information and maintaining the podcast's structure. Key technical terms are handled very well. However, improvements could be made in naturalness of expression, consistency in addressing the audience (formal vs. informal and singular vs. plural), and some minor lexical choices to achieve a more polished, native-sounding Spanish text. Despite these minor points, the core message and explanations are clear and complete."
