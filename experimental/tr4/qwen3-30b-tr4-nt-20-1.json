    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text sounds completely natural and smooth to a native Spanish speaker. There are no awkward expressions or grammatical errors. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary, including natural idiomatic equivalents like \"levantar el velo\" for \"lever le voile\" and \"tras bambalinas\" for \"en coulisses\". The formal 'usted' form is consistently and correctly applied when translating 'vous'.",

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled with excellent precision and consistency. Terms like 'pré-entraînement' become 'pre-entrenamiento', 'apprentissage par transfert' becomes 'aprendizaje por transferencia', and 'fenêtre de contexte' becomes 'ventana de contexto'. The translator skillfully handled instances where the French text provided an English equivalent, such as 'l'affinage (fine-tuning)' translated to 'el ajuste fino (fine-tuning)' and 'ancrage (grounding)' to 'anclaje (grounding)', retaining clarity. 'ICL (In-Context Learning)' was expertly translated to 'ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)'. This demonstrates a strong grasp of specialized AI terminology in Spanish.",

      "reasoning": "The translation effectively conveys the original text's intent and purpose, which is to explain complex AI concepts in an accessible podcast format. The tone is perfectly adapted for a general audience interested in technology, maintaining the engaging and informative style of the original. Culturally appropriate expressions are used, for example, 'bachoter' (cramming) is perfectly captured by 'memorizar' or 'chuleta' (cheat sheet), and the analogy of 'monter en selle' in a biking context is expertly adapted to 'se sube a la bicicleta', showing a deep understanding of contextual nuance.",
