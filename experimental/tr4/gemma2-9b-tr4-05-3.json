    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally understandable, and the sentence structures are mostly logical. However, some awkward phrasings and minor grammatical inconsistencies, such as incorrect gender/number agreement (e.g., \"las informaciones\" instead of \"la información\", \"esas conocimientos\" instead of \"esos conocimientos\"), slightly hinder the overall smoothness and ease of reading. The translation of specific phrases also sometimes feels a bit too literal, affecting natural flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation suffers from several issues that impact its naturalness. The most significant is the inconsistent use of formal and informal address (tú/usted/ustedes), which is highly unnatural and confusing for a Spanish-speaking audience in a podcast context. There are also several grammatical errors, including incorrect reflexive pronoun use (e.g., \"se recuerda\" instead of \"recuerda\"), and less natural vocabulary choices (e.g., \"el afianzamiento\" for fine-tuning, even with the parenthetical, and \"aproximación\" instead of \"enfoque\"). The title translation also changes from \"Tecnología Rápida\" at the beginning to \"Tecnología en Breve\" at the end, which is an inconsistency.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are translated accurately and consistently, such as \"pre-entrenamiento,\" \"aprendizaje por transferencia,\" \"ventana de contexto,\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL).\" The inclusion of the original English term in parentheses for \"fine-tuning\" and \"grounding\" is helpful, even if \"afianzamiento\" and \"ancrage\" are not the most common choices for these specific AI concepts in Spanish (e.g., \"ajuste fino\" is more standard for fine-tuning). The contextual translation of \"bachotage\" as \"estudiar para un examen\" is also appropriate and effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and purpose of the podcast – explaining AI concepts in an accessible manner – are largely maintained. The analogies used in the original French are effectively transferred and make sense in Spanish. However, the significant inconsistency in the use of formal and informal address (tú/usted/ustedes) creates a major disconnect for the Spanish-speaking listener, failing to establish a consistent tone or relationship between the speakers and the audience, which is a crucial aspect of contextual adaptation in spoken or podcast-like content.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original French text has been accurately conveyed in the Spanish translation. There are no notable omissions or additions that alter the core message. The explanations provided for complex concepts are complete and align with the source text, ensuring the reader receives all necessary details.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation effectively conveys the core information and technical concepts from the original French podcast. However, its overall quality is significantly hampered by inconsistent formality (mixing 'tú', 'usted', and 'ustedes'), several grammatical errors (e.g., gender/number agreement, reflexive pronoun use), and some less natural phrasings. While technical terminology is mostly handled well, these issues negatively impact the fluency and readability, making the text sound less professional and natural for a native Spanish speaker. The inconsistent translation of the podcast title also detracts from consistency."
