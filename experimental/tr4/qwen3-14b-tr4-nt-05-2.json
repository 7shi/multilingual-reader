    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely understandable, and the explanations of complex AI concepts are clear. However, recurring grammatical errors (e.g., gender agreement, missing punctuation) and some awkward phrasing slightly detract from a completely smooth reading experience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The inconsistent use of formal (\"ustedes\") and informal (\"tú\") address throughout the dialogue significantly impacts the natural flow and professionalism expected in a podcast. Additionally, some phrasing, like \"Eso es exactamente eso\" and the pluralization of \"información\" as \"informaciones,\" sounds unnatural to a native speaker. The incorrect conjugation of \"malentendido\" and the gender agreement error \"Las nuevas conocimientos\" are also notable grammatical issues affecting fluency.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento,\" \"afinamiento\" (with the added \"fine-tuning\"), \"aprendizaje por transferencia,\" and \"anclaje\" (with \"grounding\") are translated accurately and consistently. The adaptation of \"ICL (In-Context Learning)\" to \"ACP (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\" is particularly well-handled, demonstrating a good understanding of both the English and Spanish technical landscapes.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally conveys the original intent. However, the phrase \"en coulisses\" (behind the scenes) being translated as \"a sus espaldas\" (behind their backs), which implies deceit, is a significant misinterpretation of the original nuance and negatively impacts contextual adaptation. The inconsistent use of 'tú' and 'ustedes' forms also detracts from establishing a consistent and appropriate tone for a podcast.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French text is present in the Spanish translation, with no omissions. The inclusion of English equivalents for technical terms like \"fine-tuning\" and \"grounding\" and the Spanish acronym for \"In-Context Learning\" (\"ACP\") are helpful supplements that enhance understanding without adding redundancy.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully conveys the core information about AI learning processes, and its handling of technical terminology is strong. However, significant grammatical errors (e.g., gender agreement, verb conjugation, missing punctuation), inconsistent formal/informal address, and some awkward phrasing notably detract from the overall quality, impacting fluency and naturalness for a native Spanish speaker. The mistranslation of \"en coulisses\" also shows a lack of nuanced contextual understanding in one instance."
