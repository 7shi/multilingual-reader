    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally comprehensible, conveying the main ideas. However, there are instances of unnatural phrasing (\"Vea más bien\", \"se ataque a\"), grammatical errors (\"las informaciones\", \"Las conocimientos\", \"recuerda de esta información\", \"una truco\"), and direct lexical mistranslations (\"chismear\" for \"bachoter\", \"nota al pie\" for \"antisèche\") that impede smooth reading and require the reader to re-read or infer meaning. The redundant speaker tags also clutter the text.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation frequently suffers from a lack of naturalness. Literal translations of French expressions (\"Vea más bien\", \"se ataque a\", \"fue simplemente vacío\") and grammatical mistakes (\"Las conocimientos\", \"una truco\") make parts of the text sound awkward and not idiomatic Spanish. The mistranslations of \"bachoter\" and \"antisèche\" are notable fluency issues, as they break the flow and introduce incorrect meaning.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The translation demonstrates a very good command of technical terminology related to AI. Terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento,\" \"ajuste fino\" (fine-tuning), \"aprendizaje por transferencia,\" \"ventana de contexto,\" and \"anclaje\" (grounding) are accurately and consistently translated. The explanation of ICL as \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\" is also appropriate. There are no notable errors in the core technical vocabulary.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation successfully conveys the original text's intent and purpose, which is to explain AI learning processes. The conversational tone between Camille and Luc is maintained. There are no major cultural insensitivities or inappropriate expressions. However, the mistranslations of idiomatic phrases like \"bachoter\" and \"antisèche\" indicate a slight lack of adaptation for equivalent common expressions in Spanish, even if the overall context is understandable.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation accurately transfers all the information from the source text. No critical details or explanations were omitted, and the flow of the discussion about AI learning stages is fully preserved. The explanations provided in the source text are completely mirrored in the target text.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation accurately renders most of the technical content, with appropriate terminology for AI concepts. However, it is significantly affected by several grammatical errors, awkward literal translations, and critical mistranslations of common idioms and phrases. These issues notably impact the text's naturalness, readability, and overall fluency for a native Spanish speaker. The repeated speaker tags in the output also detract from presentation."
