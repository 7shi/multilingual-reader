    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is exceptionally clear and easy to understand. Sentence structures are logical and flow smoothly, making the complex AI concepts accessible to the target audience. The use of analogies, consistent with the original podcast style, significantly enhances comprehension.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds highly natural and idiomatic to a native Spanish speaker. There are no awkward grammatical constructions or unnatural expressions. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary for a tech podcast. Examples like \"Mira\" for \"Voyez plutôt\" and \"chuleta\" for \"antisèche\" demonstrate excellent naturalness and cultural adaptation.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled with great accuracy and consistency. Terms like \"preentrenamiento,\" \"ajuste fino\" (with \"fine-tuning\" in parentheses), \"aprendizaje por transferencia,\" \"ventana de contexto,\" \"aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (In-Context Learning),\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are all correctly translated and, where appropriate, include the English equivalent for clarity in a tech context. The minor variation between \"ajuste fino\" and \"afinamiento\" is negligible given the overall accuracy.",

      "reasoning": "The translation perfectly captures the intent and purpose of the original podcast, which is to explain technical subjects in an engaging, conversational manner.
