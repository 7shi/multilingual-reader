    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely understandable, and the key concepts are conveyed. However, frequent grammatical errors, especially gender and number agreement issues (e.g., 'Las conocimientos' instead of 'Los conocimientos', 'esta enfoque' instead of 'este enfoque'), and incorrect vocabulary choices ('bachear', 'antisseta') interrupt the flow and require the reader to re-read or infer meaning. This detracts from overall comprehensibility and ease of reading.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation lacks naturalness and smoothness. A significant issue is the inconsistent use of formal ('usted/ustedes') and informal ('tú') address forms throughout the dialogue, which is highly unnatural in Spanish. Additionally, several phrases are translated too literally from French, leading to awkward constructions ('le proporcionarle', 'malentende') and incorrect verb conjugations ('usted afinan'). The vocabulary choices for common idioms are sometimes inaccurate ('bachear' for 'bachoter', 'trampa' for 'astuce').",

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as 'preentrenamiento', 'afinado' (for fine-tuning), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', and 'anclaje' are correctly identified and used. However, the translation falters on non-technical but crucial vocabulary used to explain these concepts, such as 'bachear' for 'cramming' and 'antisseta' for 'cheat sheet'. The redundant translation of the ICL acronym also shows a minor oversight.",

    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The core intent and purpose of the original podcast, which is to explain AI concepts in an accessible manner, are largely maintained. The analogies are generally well-transferred. However, the pervasive grammatical errors and inconsistent formality detract from the conversational and engaging tone expected of a podcast, making it less adapted to a native Spanish-speaking audience than it could be.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original French text has been conveyed in the Spanish translation. There are no notable omissions, additions, or misinterpretations of the core content. The issues lie more in the quality of the expression rather than the presence of information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully conveys the core information and the technical concepts discussed in the podcast. However, its quality is significantly hampered by consistent grammatical errors, particularly regarding gender and number agreement, and verb conjugations. The inconsistent use of formal and informal address forms ('tú' vs. 'usted/ustedes') is a major detractor from fluency and naturalness in a conversational context. Additionally, several key vocabulary choices for non-technical terms are incorrect or unnatural, making the text feel less polished and more like a literal machine translation."
