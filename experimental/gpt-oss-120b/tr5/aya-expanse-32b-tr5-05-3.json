  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained with suitable examples. Minor verbosity does not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, using idiomatic Spanish (¡Exacto!, ¡Una analogía perfecta!). A few awkward choices lower the fluency: the expansion of the acronym ICL as \"Lenguaje de Comprensión e Interpretación\" is forced and not idiomatic, and occasional literal renderings (e.g., \"ventana de contexto\") feel slightly stiff.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally well‑handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento (ajuste fino)\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" are appropriate. The only notable issue is the mis‑translation of ICL, which could confuse readers familiar with the standard English acronym.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish‑speaking listeners, preserving the conversational style and humor. Cultural references are kept neutral, and the proper name \"Tech Éclair\" is retained as a brand, which is suitable.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the examples and analogies are kept intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality, conveying the technical concepts and podcast’s lively tone effectively. Minor issues with the ICL acronym expansion and a few slightly literal phrases prevent a perfect score, but the text remains highly understandable and faithful to the source.\nOverall rating: 90/100 (average 18/20 per criterion)."
