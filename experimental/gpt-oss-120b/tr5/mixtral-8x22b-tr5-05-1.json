    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and conveys the flow of the podcast dialogue. Most sentences are clear, and the explanations of pre‑training, transfer learning and in‑context learning are understandable. However, there are a few awkward questions (e.g., the mix‑up of \"español\" instead of \"francés\") and occasional overly literal translations that momentarily hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several expressions are unidiomatic: \"Luc puede tomar\" (instead of \"Luc puede usar\"), \"ancaje\" (the usual term is \"anclaje\"), and the French word \"antisèche\" is left unchanged. The retention of French terms such as \"affinage\" also makes the prose feel foreign to native Spanish speakers. These issues lower the overall smoothness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and the acronym ICL are preserved. The translation of \"transfer learning\" as \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" is spot‑on. Inconsistencies appear with \"affinage\" (kept in French instead of a Spanish equivalent like \"ajuste fino\") and \"grounding\" rendered as \"ancaje\". The mixed usage slightly detracts from term consistency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The informal, conversational tone of a podcast is well kept, and cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only notable mis‑adaptation is the mistaken reference to \"español\" when the original was about learning French, which could confuse listeners. Apart from that, the adaptation respects the original intent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent knowledge distinction, and the explanation of \"memory\" features. No substantial content is omitted. Minor issues such as leaving \"antisèche\" untranslated do not affect factual completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content and the lively podcast atmosphere. Readability and completeness are strong points, but fluency suffers from occasional unidiomatic phrasing and a few untranslated French words. Terminology is mostly accurate, though consistency could be improved by fully localising terms like \"affinage\" and \"grounding\". Fixing the language mix‑up (Spanish vs. French) and replacing French borrowings with natural Spanish equivalents would raise the quality to a near‑native level."
