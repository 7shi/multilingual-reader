    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and the flow of ideas follows the original. Most sentences are easy to understand, and the technical concepts are explained in accessible language. Minor issues such as the isolated line “Luc: ajuste fino” and occasional mixed verb forms slightly interrupt the smoothness, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural, but there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., “Luc: ajuste fino” as a stand‑alone fragment, mixed use of ‘abres’/‘comienzas’, and retaining the English word *prompt* without adaptation). Some phrasing is slightly literal (“es una memoria de uso único”), which a native speaker might phrase differently. Overall it is understandable but not fully idiomatic.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, anclaje. The biggest inconsistency is the change of the acronym ICL to AEC, which could confuse readers familiar with the original term. The English word *prompt* is left unchanged, which is acceptable in a technical context but could have been italicised or explained. Otherwise the terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references (consultor brillante, cramming for an exam) well for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The explanations remain faithful, and the tone of a podcast dialogue is preserved. Small lapses (the isolated “Luc: ajuste fino”) slightly reduce the adaptation quality, but overall the message is conveyed effectively.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, temporary vs permanent knowledge, and the “memory” feature. No substantive information is omitted, though the acronym change and the brief “Luc: ajuste fino” line slightly reduce precision. The content remains complete and coherent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical discussion in a clear, mostly natural Spanish. It captures the podcast’s conversational style and explains complex AI concepts understandably. Minor issues—such as a stray speaker label, a non‑idiomatic phrase, and the inconsistent handling of the ICL acronym—prevent it from being flawless, but they do not significantly hinder the reader. Overall, it is a good, functional translation with room for polishing to reach native‑speaker fluency and terminological consistency."
