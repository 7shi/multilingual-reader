  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the explanations of complex AI concepts are understandable for a non‑expert audience. Minor typographical issues (e.g., missing accent in “Internet”) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few expressions feel slightly forced or literal, such as “Lee cantidades masivas de datos en internet”, “bachotaje”, and the inconsistent use of quotation marks around “olvidado”. These do not break the flow but reduce native‑speaker smoothness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento (fine‑tuning), aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding → anclaje, etc. There is a small inconsistency between “aprendizaje contextual” and “aprendizaje en contexto”, but the meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The informal podcast tone and conversational style are preserved. Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor phrasing could be refined, but the original intent and purpose are fully conveyed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas from the original French script are present; no significant information is omitted or altered. Redundancies are minimal and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality: it accurately transmits the technical content and retains the original conversational tone. Minor fluency hiccups and slight inconsistencies in terminology prevent a perfect score, but the text is readable, complete, and well adapted to the target audience.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 17/20.\nScore out of 20: 17"
