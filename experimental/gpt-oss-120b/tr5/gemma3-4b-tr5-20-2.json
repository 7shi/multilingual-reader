  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clearly expressed. Most sentences preserve the logical flow of the original French dialogue. The only drawback is the insertion of three alternative questions (\"¿Entonces? / ¿A eso te refieres? / ¿Qué quieres decir?\") which adds unnecessary clutter and can momentarily confuse the reader.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, but several word choices feel literal or uncommon for a native Spanish speaker. Examples include \"afinado\" for fine‑tuning (more usual would be \"ajuste fino\"), \"bachorear\" for \"cramming\" (a neologism not widely used), and the occasional awkward phrasing such as \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotage\" (the original did not contain this exact construction). These issues lower the overall fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\" and \"anclaje\" are appropriate. Consistency is good throughout the text. The only minor lapse is the translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"afinado\", which is less standard, but it does not impede understanding.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts well to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are preserved, and the explanatory tone remains intact. The occasional literal translations do not distort the original intent. Overall, the purpose and style of the podcast are conveyed effectively.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted, and the only additions are the redundant question alternatives, which do not remove content. The translation remains faithful to the source.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the substance of the original French podcast and is largely clear and accurate. Readability and completeness are strong, but fluency suffers from a few unnatural lexical choices and overly literal renderings. Technical terminology is mostly appropriate, though \"afinado\" could be replaced by a more common term. With minor stylistic adjustments, the translation would be near‑perfect for native Spanish listeners.\nOverall Score: 17/20.\n\nOverall Rating (average of criteria): 17/20."
