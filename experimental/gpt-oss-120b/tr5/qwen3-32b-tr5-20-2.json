    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are not overly long and the dialogue format is preserved, allowing listeners to understand the concepts. Minor issues such as the hyphenated “pre‑entrenamiento” (more natural as “preentrenamiento”) and occasional redundant phrasing slightly affect smoothness, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, with appropriate exclamation marks and colloquial interjections (¡Exacto!, ¡Una analogía perfecta!). However, there are a few literal constructions (e.g., “Imagina que enviamos una IA completamente nueva a la escuela…”) and the erroneous acronym “AIC” instead of “ICL”. The repetition in “aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)” is awkward. These issues lower the overall fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely rendered correctly: “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “grounding”. The translation of “fine‑tuning” as “afinamiento” is acceptable but less common than “ajuste fino”. The wrong acronym “AIC” is a clear mistake, and the English parenthetical “fine‑tuning” is left untranslated. Consistency could be improved, hence the moderate score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator kept the podcast’s informal, explanatory tone, using Spanish‑appropriate expressions and punctuation. Cultural references are unchanged (which is fine because the content is technical). The overall adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience is strong, with only minor stylistic quirks.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present: pre‑training, transfer learning, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, grounding, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No substantive information is omitted, and the translation does not add irrelevant material. The only loss is the incorrect acronym, which is a small factual slip.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is very good. It conveys the technical content clearly and preserves the conversational style of the podcast. Minor lexical choices, a few literal translations, and the typo in the acronym prevent it from being perfect, but the meaning is intact and the text would be readily understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts. With a quick proofread to fix the acronym and smooth a few phrases, the translation would reach an excellent level of quality."
