  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated dialogue is difficult to follow. Several lines are left in English or contain irrelevant interjections such as \"Hola\", \"Hola mundo\" or \"Escriba en español\" that break the flow. Important parts of the conversation are missing (e.g., Luc’s explanations about the \"ventana de contexto\" are truncated). Because of these gaps and random insertions, a Spanish‑speaking reader would struggle to understand the content.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains many ungrammatical or out‑of‑place phrases (\"Hola\", \"Hola mundo\", \"Hola\" standing alone, \"Escriba en español\"). Sentence structures are broken, and the natural rhythm of a spoken podcast is lost. The language does not sound like native, conversational Spanish.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje) are mostly retained, which is good. However, the translation sometimes drops the term, substitutes it with an English word, or adds unrelated filler. Consistency is lacking, and some concepts are not explained when they could benefit from clarification.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent—to explain AI training concepts in an accessible podcast format—is largely lost. The translation inserts unrelated instructions and fails to adapt cultural references (e.g., the “consultant” analogy is broken). Moreover, the random Spanish interjections give a different tone, confusing the intended educational style.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are omitted or replaced by placeholders (e.g., \"Luc: Hola\", \"Camille: El texto no fue proporcionado para traducir\"). Important explanations about fine‑tuning versus in‑context learning are missing or truncated, leading to a loss of essential information.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is far from satisfactory. It mixes Spanish, English, and unexplained filler words, drops whole sentences, and includes instructional notes that should not appear in the final text. The result is a fragmented, unintelligible version that fails to convey the original podcast’s educational content. A thorough rewrite is needed, preserving the conversational tone, correcting the random insertions, and ensuring all technical explanations are fully translated and coherent.\n\nScore Summary:\n- Readability: 4/20\n- Fluency: 3/20\n- Terminology: 6/20\n- Contextual Adaptation: 5/20\n- Information Completeness: 4/20"
