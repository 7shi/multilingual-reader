    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. The only noticeable issue is the typo “ACD” instead of “ICL”, which could momentarily confuse readers.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, using appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic phrasing. There are a few slightly awkward constructions (e.g., “el modelo experto en inglés” vs. “un modelo experto en inglés”, mixed capitalization of “Aprendizaje en Contexto”) and the term “afinamiento” could be rendered as “ajuste fino”, but these do not severely impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, anclaje, memoria. Consistency is mostly maintained, but the accidental “ACD” breaks the terminology consistency and could mislead readers.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts well to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using familiar expressions and preserving the podcast’s informal tone. The only minor inconsistency is the final mention of the original French title «Tech Éclair» while the rest of the episode is called “Tecnología Relámpago”.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is conveyed. No substantive content is omitted, and the explanatory depth is retained. The typo “ACD” and the name inconsistency are the only minor lapses.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It communicates the technical discussion clearly, uses appropriate terminology, and feels natural for Spanish listeners. Minor typographical errors (the “ACD” instead of “ICL”) and a few stylistic choices prevent it from being perfect, but they do not significantly detract from the listener’s understanding.\n\nStrengths: accurate rendering of technical concepts, good readability, culturally appropriate tone. Areas for improvement: eliminate typographical mistakes, consider more idiomatic terms for \"fine‑tuning\" (e.g., \"ajuste fino\"), ensure consistent naming throughout the script.\n\nScore: 91/100."
