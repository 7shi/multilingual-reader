  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured, and complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained in plain language. Minor issues are a few long sentences that could be split, but overall comprehension is excellent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic. A few phrases are slightly literal (e.g., \"hablar contigo\" after \"empezar a hablar contigo\" and \"unos apuntes\" instead of \"una antisèche\"), but they do not impede fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"transfer learning\", \"in‑context learning\", \"grounding\", \"prompt\", \"ventana de contexto\". The use of italics for English terms is consistent. Minor quibble: \"memoria a corto plazo\" would be more common as \"memoria de corto plazo\".",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using familiar analogies (consultor brillante, estudiar de memoria, aprender a andar en bicicleta). Cultural references are preserved, and the tone matches the original podcast style.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and nuances from the French original are present. No significant information is omitted or altered, and the structure mirrors the source closely.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical concepts accurately, reads naturally, and retains the original intent and style. Minor stylistic tweaks could raise fluency to perfection, but the work is solid and ready for a Spanish‑language audience.\n\nStrengths: clear explanations, consistent terminology, good cultural adaptation.\nAreas for improvement: smooth out a couple of literal phrasings and consider more idiomatic expressions for \"memoria a corto plazo\" and \"apuntes\".\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.2 / 20, which reflects an excellent translation with only slight room for refinement."
