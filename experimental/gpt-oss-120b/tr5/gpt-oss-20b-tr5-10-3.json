    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the flow mirrors the original dialogue. However, there is a notable mistranslation of the French idiom « bachoter » as «cramer», which is not a Spanish verb and may confuse readers. This small error detracts from overall comprehensibility.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places; vocabulary choices are appropriate and the dialogue feels fluid. Minor awkwardness appears in the literal rendering of certain phrases (e.g., «cramer para un examen»). Apart from that, the language is smooth and idiomatic for a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: «preentrenamiento», «ajuste fino», «aprendizaje por transferencia», «ventana de contexto», «aprendizaje en contexto», «ICL», «anclaje». Consistency is maintained throughout. Keeping the English acronym ICL is acceptable and does not cause confusion.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience effectively, preserving the original intent and tone. Cultural references are neutral and the analogies (consultor brillante, aprender a montar bicicleta) work well. The only drawback is the incorrect verb «cramer», which feels out of place culturally.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present, and no substantive information is omitted. The only flaw is the inaccurate translation of the “cram for an exam” expression, which slightly changes the nuance. Otherwise, the content is complete and faithful.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical concepts accurately, uses appropriate terminology, and reads naturally for Spanish listeners. The primary issues are a single mistranslation (\"cramer\") and a few minor phrasing choices that could be refined. With those small corrections, the translation would be near‑perfect for a podcast audience."
