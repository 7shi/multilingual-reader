  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Complex ideas are explained in a way that most readers can understand. However, there are repeated speaker tags (e.g., \"Camille: Camille :\") that create visual clutter and can momentarily confuse the reader. Aside from that, sentence structures are logical and the flow mirrors the original.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, using appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic expressions. A few phrases feel slightly forced (e.g., \"es del bachotaje\" instead of a more common \"es como el bachotaje\"), and the duplicated speaker labels break the smoothness. Overall, a native speaker would find it fluent with minor hiccups.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje, etc. The choices are appropriate for a non‑expert audience and no key term is mistranslated or omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are adapted correctly (e.g., \"consultor brillante\"). Minor issues stem from the duplicated labels, but they do not alter the message. Overall the adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No content is lost, and no unnecessary additions are made. The only redundancy is the repeated speaker tags, which do not affect factual completeness.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and is largely readable and natural. The main drawbacks are formatting artefacts (repeated speaker identifiers) and a few slightly awkward phrasings. With a quick editorial clean‑up, the text would be excellent for a Spanish‑language podcast transcript.\n\nOverall score: 86/100."
