    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is riddled with out‑of‑place interjections such as “Hola”, “Hola mundo”, and literal instructions (“Escriba en español”, “Muestre solo el texto de traducción solicitada”). Many sentences are truncated or missing, making the flow disjointed and hard to follow. A reader would have to guess the intended meaning in several places.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text does not sound natural to a native Spanish speaker. It mixes Spanish, English, French fragments and inexplicable placeholders. Grammar is often incorrect (e.g., “El afinamiento…”, “Es exactamente eso” used in odd contexts). Overall the prose feels broken and artificial.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding) are mostly retained, which is good. However, many of them appear without explanation, and some are left in English or French (“Hola”, “Hola mundo”). Consistency suffers, and the occasional omission of terms reduces clarity.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to adapt the original conversational tone for a Spanish‑speaking audience. It inserts irrelevant meta‑comments (“Escriba en español”, “Muestre solo el texto de traducción solicitada”) that were not present in the source. Cultural references are untouched, but the overall intent is obscured by the noise.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several original statements are missing or replaced by placeholder text. For example, Luc’s explanations about “pre‑entrenamiento” and “in‑context learning” are cut short or replaced with “Hola”. Important explanatory content is lost, resulting in an incomplete rendition of the original podcast script.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of very low quality. It contains numerous non‑translated fragments, random interjections, and missing content, which together break readability, fluency, and completeness. While the core technical vocabulary is partially preserved, the overall rendering does not convey the original message effectively and would confuse Spanish‑speaking listeners. Substantial revision is required to produce a coherent, accurate, and natural translation.\n\n**Overall score (average):** 4.4 / 20"
