  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the dialogue format is preserved. Sentences are mostly clear, and complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in understandable language. Minor punctuation quirks (e.g., “El pre‑entrenamiento.”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural, but a few constructions feel slightly awkward (“expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo”, “Es una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”). The mistaken acronym “AIC” instead of “ICL” also breaks the flow. Overall the prose is fluent enough for native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento (fine‑tuning), aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto), grounding → anclaje. The choice of “anclaje” is acceptable, though “vinculación” or “enraizamiento” could be more common. The acronym error (AIC) is a noticeable slip.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational tone of a podcast is well preserved, and cultural references are neutral, making the content appropriate for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Small stylistic tweaks (e.g., using «pre‑entrenamiento» without hyphen) could improve naturalness, but the intent and purpose are fully conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key points from the French original are present: the stages of learning, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, the explanation of memory‑like features, and the consultant‑vs‑expert analogy. No major information is lost, apart from the brief typo of the acronym.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the original podcast’s educational dialogue effectively. Readability and completeness are strong, and the technical vocabulary is handled well. The main weaknesses are a couple of slightly unnatural phrasings and an incorrect acronym (AIC instead of ICL), which slightly detract from fluency and terminology precision. With minor edits, the text would be near‑perfect for a native Spanish audience.\nOverall score (average): 17/20."
