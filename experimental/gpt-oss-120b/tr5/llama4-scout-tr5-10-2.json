  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many formatting artefacts (misplaced quotation marks, duplicated speaker tags, remnants of English text) that interrupt the flow. While the core sentences are understandable, the reader must parse through irregular punctuation and occasional redundant phrases, which reduces overall clarity.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural for native Spanish speakers (e.g., \"Imaginad que enviamos una inteligencia artificial totalmente nueva\", \"Es una memoria de un solo uso\", and the inconsistent use of quotation marks). The vocabulary is generally appropriate, but the presence of English fragments and awkward sentence constructions make the text feel stilted.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\", \"anclaje\". The occasional retention of English terms (e.g., \"grounding\") is acceptable with the parenthetical translation. Consistency is good, so the terminology handling is strong.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and explanations, and the examples remain clear. However, the cultural adaptation is hampered by the leftover English/French snippets and the lack of smooth integration, which slightly detracts from a fully natural Spanish presentation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory tricks, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. No essential information is omitted, though some redundancy appears due to duplicated lines.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full content and most technical concepts accurately, but it suffers from numerous formatting and fluency issues that impede readability. Cleaning up the speaker tags, removing stray English text, and smoothing awkward phrasing would raise the quality substantially. As it stands, the translation is functional but feels rough and somewhat unpolished for a native‑speaker audience.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14/20."
