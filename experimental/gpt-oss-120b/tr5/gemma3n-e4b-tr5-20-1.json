  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is overall understandable and the logical flow of the dialogue is preserved. However, there are several typographical errors (e.g., \"¡Bonnjour\", \"pre-entrerenamiento\", \"Transformeers\", \"artiña\") and occasional mixing of formal/informal registers (\"usted\" vs \"tú\"/\"vosotros\") that slightly hinder smooth reading. Despite these issues, a native speaker can grasp the content without major difficulty.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Naturalness suffers from multiple awkward constructions and spelling mistakes. Phrases such as \"¡Bonnjour y bienvenido/a\", \"podéis tomar\", \"se podría decir eso\" (instead of a more idiomatic \"se podría decir que\"), and the typo \"artiña\" break the flow. Some sentences are literal translations that feel stiff (e.g., \"el concepto de \\\"anclaje\\\"\" instead of \"el concepto de \\\"grounding\\\"\" which could be explained). These issues prevent the text from sounding completely native.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely well‑handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"prompt\" are retained correctly. The translation of \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\" is acceptable in this context. Minor inconsistencies appear (e.g., \"Transformeers\" misspelled, mixed use of \"usted\"/\"vosotros\"). Overall the terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and conversational tone, adapting the content for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Nevertheless, the presence of French words like \"¡Bonnjour\" and occasional anglicisms without adaptation (e.g., \"prompt\" left in English) reduce cultural appropriateness. Some sentences could be phrased more naturally for the target audience, but the core message is retained.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is maintained. The only loss is minor nuance due to typographical errors, but the factual content remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full substance of the original podcast script and uses appropriate technical vocabulary. However, it is marred by several typographical errors, inconsistent register, and occasional unnatural phrasing that affect readability and fluency. A careful proofread and slight stylistic adjustments would raise the quality substantially, bringing it closer to a native‑like, polished Spanish text.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15.2 / 20."
