  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the structure of the original dialogue. Most sentences convey the intended meaning, and the flow of the conversation is preserved. However, there are several typographical and orthographic errors (e.g., missing accent in \"¿Porque\", misspelling \"trasfiere\" instead of \"transfiere\", missing closing quotation marks) and occasional awkward phrasing that slightly hinder smooth reading. Overall, a native reader can follow the content, but the text would benefit from careful proofreading.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly sounds natural, but a number of expressions feel literal or stilted (e.g., \"El preentrenamiento.\" as an isolated line, \"El afinamiento... ¿es ahí donde interviene el «aprendizaje por transferencia»?\", \"la IA no tiene «olvidado» en el sentido humano del término\"). Small grammatical slips and missing diacritics also affect fluency. Vocabulary choices are appropriate, yet the text would read more smoothly with minor re‑phrasings.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinación\" (fine‑tuning), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"grounding\" (rendered as \"anclaje\"), and \"memoria a corto plazo\" are correctly translated and used consistently throughout. The occasional retention of English terms like \"prompt\" is acceptable in a technical context. No major terminology errors are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose of the podcast script. Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is required. Minor issues (missing accents, occasional literal translations) slightly reduce the naturalness for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but the overall message and pedagogical style remain intact.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No sentences or concepts have been omitted, and the dialogue structure is retained. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy and keeps the content concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and maintains the conversational flow of the original podcast. While terminology and completeness are strong points, the text suffers from several typographical and stylistic issues that affect readability and fluency. A thorough copy‑edit focusing on accents, spelling, and natural phrasing would raise the overall quality considerably. As it stands, the translation is solid in substance but needs polishing for a native Spanish audience."
