  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. However, there are several confusing fragments (e.g., “empollarse dominar realmente”, “On tiene la impresión”) and occasional missing punctuation that force the reader to pause and re‑interpret.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound natural, but a number of awkward constructions and literal translations betray non‑native phrasing. Errors such as “empollarse dominar realmente”, mixed French/Spanish pronouns (“On”), and inconsistent use of asterisks break the natural rhythm.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is mostly accurate: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “ICL”, “anclaje”, etc. The translator kept key terms consistent and provided the Spanish equivalents where appropriate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and explains the concepts for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor cultural mismatches appear (e.g., retaining the French pronoun “On”), and some sentences could be smoother, but the overall message is intact.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present; no major ideas are omitted. The only notable issue is the garbled phrase “empollarse dominar realmente”, which slightly reduces clarity but does not remove essential information.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in delivering the technical content and preserves the structure of the podcast dialogue. Technical terms are well handled, and the core information is complete. Nevertheless, the text suffers from several grammatical slips, unnatural phrasing, and a few unintelligible fragments that detract from readability and fluency. A careful proofreading and revision of the problematic sentences would bring the translation to a native‑like level.\nOverall rating (average of criteria): 15/20.\nScore out of 20 points: 15"
