  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is difficult to read because it mixes the dialogue with extensive meta‑annotations (Vocabulaire clé, Intent, Context, etc.). These insertions break the flow of the conversation, making it hard for a Spanish‑speaking listener to follow the podcast script. The remaining dialogue sentences are understandable, but the overall structure is cluttered.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish sentences show several unnatural constructions (e.g., \"el « preentrenamiento »\", \"Exactamente. Y este aprendizaje comienza con un proceso llamado el « preentrenamiento »\", \"las nuevas conocimientos\"), inconsistent use of quotation marks, and occasional grammar slips. While most ideas are conveyed, the prose does not read smoothly to a native speaker.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (pre‑entraînement, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, fenêtre de contexte) are generally translated, but the handling is inconsistent: sometimes they stay in French quotes, sometimes they are rendered in Spanish, and occasional mismatches appear (e.g., \"las nuevas conocimientos\"). The terminology is recognizable but not uniformly applied.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent—a conversational podcast—has been altered by the insertion of instructional commentary and vocabulary tables, which are inappropriate for the target medium. Cultural and stylistic adaptation is therefore poor; the translation feels more like a language‑learning handout than a podcast script.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original dialogue are present, so no essential information is lost. However, the added meta‑information creates redundancy and distracts from the core content, and a few nuanced tonal cues from the original are softened by the literal style.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation manages to convey the technical content of the original podcast, but it does so in a format that is far from the intended spoken‑dialogue style. The inclusion of extensive explanatory side‑bars and inconsistent terminology makes the text less readable and less natural for Spanish‑speaking listeners. While the core ideas are intact, the style, fluency, and adaptation to the target context need substantial improvement to be suitable as a podcast script."
