  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the flow of a podcast dialogue. However, there are several stray annotations (e.g., \"becomes El pre‑entrenamiento\", multiple quotation marks, and meta‑comments like \"Camille: \"Es decir\" \"¿O sea?\" \"Quiero decir\") that interrupt the reading experience. Some sentences are a bit long or lack proper punctuation, which slightly hampers smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation uses mostly natural Spanish vocabulary and syntax. Phrases such as \"Imaginad que enviamos una inteligencia artificial\" and \"El aprendizaje por transferencia es la clave\" read well. Nevertheless, occasional awkward constructions, misplaced quotation marks, and inconsistent capitalization make the text feel less polished than a native‑level script.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\", etc. The terminology is consistent throughout and appropriate for a non‑expert audience. No major mistranslations of key concepts are observed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral and suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. The main drawback is the presence of editorial notes that were not in the source, which slightly reduces the natural adaptation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the essential information from the French script is conveyed: explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No significant content is omitted, though the extra meta‑comments add noise rather than missing data.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content and the conversational style of the original podcast. It handles specialized terminology well and keeps the core messages intact. The main issues are editorial artifacts (extra quotes, parenthetical notes) and occasional phrasing that feels slightly unnatural. Cleaning up these remnants would raise readability and fluency to a near‑native level.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 14/20, Fluency 15/20, Terminology 18/20, Contextual Adaptation 16/20, Information Completeness 18/20. Total: 81/100.\n\nThe translation is functional and useful, but it would benefit from a final proofreading pass to remove the stray markers and smooth out a few awkward sentences.\n\n**Overall score:** 81/100"
