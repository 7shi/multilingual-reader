  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original dialogue structure, but several sentences are clunky or redundant (e.g., “El preentrenamiento es un tema fascinante” repeats a phrase unnecessarily). Mixed‑language insertions (French words like *requête*, *coulisses*) and occasional English terms break the flow, making it harder for a native Spanish reader to follow smoothly.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are many unnatural constructions and code‑switching. Phrases such as “insère automáticamente esos fragmentos en el prompt en coulisses” or “el sistema busca rápidamente en tus antiguos intercambios las informaciones pertinentes para tu nueva requête” sound awkward. The presence of untranslated English/French terms reduces the naturalness. Overall, the translation feels semi‑fluid rather than fully native.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly well‑handled: *preentrenamiento*, *afinado*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)*, *anclaje*, *memoria a corto plazo* are correctly rendered. However, the occasional retention of English words like *prompt* and French terms creates inconsistency, slightly lowering the score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Nevertheless, the stray French words and occasional literal translations (e.g., “consultor brillante” instead of a more idiomatic “consultor experto”) make the adaptation feel less tailored to Spanish‑speaking audiences.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present; no substantive content is lost. Minor issues such as duplicated lines or slight phrasing changes do not affect the factual completeness. The translation is therefore largely complete.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the overall message and technical content of the original French podcast, but suffers from inconsistent language mixing, occasional awkward phrasing, and minor redundancy. While the terminology is largely accurate, the presence of untranslated French and English terms hampers readability and fluency for a native Spanish audience. A thorough edit to remove foreign insertions and smooth out the prose would raise the quality significantly.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14/20."
