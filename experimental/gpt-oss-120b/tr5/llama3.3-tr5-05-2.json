  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas without major ambiguity. Minor punctuation issues (e.g., missing question mark after “¿La diferencia entre estudiar para un examen y realmente dominar un tema”) and a couple of typographical errors do not significantly impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most of the script, but there are a few awkward phrasings (“La IA no parte de cero”, “La integralidad del historial de su discusión…”) and a noticeable typo where “ICL” became “IAL”. These hiccups slightly reduce the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are correctly rendered. The only inconsistency is the accidental change of the acronym ICL to IAL, which could cause confusion for a technically‑savvy reader.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content well to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the explanatory style (consultant analogy, exam‑studying analogy) is preserved. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve flow, but overall the intent and tone are maintained.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French script is present. No major ideas are omitted, and the explanations remain intact. Small typographical slips (e.g., missing accent in \"olvidado\") do not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does an excellent job of transmitting the technical content and conversational tone of the original podcast. It is readable, mostly fluent, and technically accurate, with only a handful of minor errors (punctuation, a typo in the ICL acronym, and occasional clunky phrasing). These issues are easy to correct and do not detract significantly from the overall quality.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.2 ≈ 18/20."
