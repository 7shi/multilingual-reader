  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the concepts in a logical order, and the technical explanations remain comprehensible. There is a minor grammatical slip (“parten” instead of “parte”) that does not hinder understanding but slightly reduces fluency.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text mostly sounds natural, but there are a few inconsistencies: the mix of \"tú\" and \"usted\" pronouns, some slightly formal wording (“se le ha proporcionado una guía rápida justo antes de que comience a hablar con usted”) and occasional literal renderings that feel a bit stiff. These issues prevent a fully native feel.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are appropriate. The English term \"fine‑tuning\" is kept unchanged, which is common in the field, and \"grounding\" is rendered as \"anclaje\", a reasonable Spanish equivalent. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast conversation. Cultural references are appropriate for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The main drawback is the pronoun inconsistency and occasional shift between informal and formal registers, which can slightly affect the listener’s perception.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No relevant details are omitted, and the structure mirrors the source, ensuring the listener receives the full content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is very solid. It faithfully conveys the technical content and maintains the conversational style of the podcast. Minor grammatical slips, pronoun inconsistencies, and occasional overly formal phrasing prevent it from being perfect, but the core message is fully preserved and understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\nStrengths: clear exposition of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. Terminology is mostly accurate and consistent.\n\nAreas for improvement: unify the register (choose either \"tú\" or \"usted\"), fix the small grammatical error, and consider translating \"fine‑tuning\" to \"ajuste fino\" for full Spanish immersion.\n\nScore (average): 17.8 ≈ 18/20."
