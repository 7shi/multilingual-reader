    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the sentences are logically ordered. The complex ideas about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained clearly. Minor issues affect smooth reading: the word *crammar* (a French‑derived verb) is not Spanish and should be *empollar* or *estudiar intensamente*. A few punctuation choices are slightly off, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are occasional awkward constructions: *Imaginen que se envía una IA…* could be *Imaginen que envían una IA…*, and *crammar para un examen* is ungrammatical. The use of *afinamiento* for “fine‑tuning” is acceptable but less common than *ajuste fino*. Overall, a native speaker would understand the text, yet a few phrases feel foreign‑translated.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)*, *ventana de contexto*, *anclaje (grounding)*, and *memoria* are correctly rendered and used consistently. The only slight inconsistency is the choice of *afinamiento* instead of the more widely used *ajuste fino*, but the meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts the examples to Spanish‑speaking listeners (e.g., “consultor brillante”). Cultural references are neutral, and the pedagogical analogies work. The only drawback is the non‑Spanish verb *crammar*, which slightly breaks the cultural adaptation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted, and the structure mirrors the original episode flow. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality and conveys the technical discussion effectively. It maintains the educational tone of the podcast and includes the necessary terminology. Minor lexical errors (notably the use of *crammar*) and a few slightly stiff phrasings prevent a perfect score, but they do not compromise the overall understanding. With a quick proofread to replace non‑Spanish terms and smooth a couple of sentences, the text would read as completely natural to a native Spanish audience."
