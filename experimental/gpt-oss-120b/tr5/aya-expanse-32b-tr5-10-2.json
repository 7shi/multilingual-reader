    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall clear and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences are easy to follow, and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are understandable for a non‑expert audience. A few sentences are a bit long or contain minor redundancies, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural, but there are several spots that feel slightly forced or mix languages (e.g., “el aprendizaje in‑context”, “bachotage”, retaining English acronyms without full Spanish equivalents). Some phrasing could be smoother (\"cuando abre una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío\"). These issues prevent a fully native‑like flow.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto), anclaje, etc., are correctly translated and consistently used. Minor points are deducted for occasional mixing of English terms without Spanish equivalents (e.g., “In‑Context Learning”).",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original intent and tone of the podcast script. Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is needed. The only minor mismatch is keeping the French podcast name “Tech Éclair” at the very end instead of the Spanish‑styled “Tech Relámpago”, which slightly reduces the cultural fit.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original script closely. No unnecessary repetitions were introduced.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and retains most of the technical nuance. Readability and terminology are strong points, while fluency suffers from occasional lexical borrowing and slightly awkward phrasing. A small cultural tweak (e.g., adapting the podcast title throughout) would polish the final product. Overall, it is a solid translation that would be easily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners, though a native‑speaker edit could improve naturalness.\n\n**Final Scores** – Readability: 17/20, Fluency: 15/20, Terminology: 18/20, Contextual Adaptation: 16/20, Information Completeness: 20/20."
