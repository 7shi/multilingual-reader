  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is cluttered with unrelated meta‑instructions (e.g., \"Muestre solo el texto de traducción solicitado\", \"Extraiga solo la traducción final al español\"), random filler lines (\"Camille: Hola\", \"Luc: El perro corre rápido\"), and abrupt topic switches. This makes it difficult for a Spanish‑speaking reader to follow the conversation and understand the flow of ideas.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Because of the inserted prompts and nonsensical interjections, many sentences sound unnatural or broken. The dialogue often repeats or truncates ideas, and the phrasing does not reflect natural spoken Spanish.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"ICL\" are correctly rendered, but other concepts like \"grounding\" are left untranslated or omitted. The inconsistency and occasional omission reduce the overall adequacy.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original podcast tone (informal, explanatory) is largely lost due to the presence of instruction fragments and missing explanatory sentences. Cultural adaptation is minimal, and the overall intent is obscured.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are missing or replaced by unrelated prompts. Important analogies, examples, and concluding remarks are either truncated or absent, leading to a loss of key information.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation fails to deliver a coherent, fluent, and complete rendering of the original French podcast. While some technical vocabulary is correctly translated, the presence of extraneous meta‑instructions, random filler, and omitted content severely undermines readability, naturalness, and fidelity to the source. Substantial revision is needed to remove the extraneous text, restore missing dialogue, and ensure a smooth, natural Spanish version that preserves the original meaning and tone.\n\nOverall rating reflects the cumulative deficiencies across all criteria.\n\nScore: 5/20 (average of the five evaluated criteria)."
