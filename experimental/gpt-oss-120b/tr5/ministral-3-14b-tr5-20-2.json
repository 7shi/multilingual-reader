  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and complex concepts are explained clearly, mirroring the original structure. Minor issues with very long sentences exist, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. A few phrasing choices (e.g., “¡Exactamente!”, “Sería increíblemente ineficiente”) are slightly informal in a podcast context, but overall the flow is smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje\" are correctly rendered and consistently used. English acronyms are kept with clear Spanish explanations, which helps comprehension.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the podcast tone and adapts cultural references (e.g., using \"usted\" in some parts, which introduces a slightly formal register but does not distort the original intent). Overall, the purpose and persuasive style are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present. No important detail is omitted, and the added emphasis markers (**…) enhance readability without altering meaning. Redundancy is minimal.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, reads naturally, and retains the original podcast’s explanatory style. Minor stylistic inconsistencies (formal vs. informal address) prevent a perfect score, but they do not affect the overall effectiveness of the translation.\nOverall score (out of 100): 91/100.\nRecommendations: harmonize the register (choose either \"tú\" or \"usted\" consistently) and consider breaking very long sentences for even better oral readability.\n\nScore: 91"
