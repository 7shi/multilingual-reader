  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the logical flow of the podcast dialogue is preserved. Minor hiccups (e.g., occasional long sentences) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are a few awkward phrasing choices such as “informaciones” (instead of “información”), “se inserta automáticamente” (instead of “se insertan”), and some literal renderings that feel slightly stilted. Overall, a native speaker would understand it easily, but the flow could be smoother.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding, etc. The translator kept the English tags in parentheses where appropriate, and the terminology is consistent throughout the text.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent and tone of the podcast are preserved. Cultural references are neutral, and the examples (consultor brillante, examen de última hora) work well for Spanish‑speaking audiences. No major cultural mismatches were found.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and nuances from the French original appear in the Spanish version. No essential information is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary material.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. Minor linguistic slips prevent it from being completely fluent, but the terminology is spot‑on and the content is fully retained. With a few edits to smooth out awkward phrases, it would reach a near‑perfect level.\nOverall score (out of 100): 87/100."
