  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas flow logically. Most sentences are easy to follow, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can grasp. Minor punctuation errors (missing opening ¿, occasional missing spaces) and a couple of typographical slips slightly hinder smooth reading, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, using appropriate everyday vocabulary. A few phrases are slightly awkward (e.g., \"proveerle los documentos precisos que necesita el proyecto en curso\" and \"se acuerda\" instead of \"se recuerda\"), and there are occasional minor grammatical glitches. Overall, a native speaker would understand it without effort, but the prose could be polished further.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinación\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\", \"grounding\"/\"anclaje\". Consistency is maintained throughout, and no key term is omitted or mistranslated.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a conversational podcast. Cultural references are neutral, and the examples remain relevant. Small issues such as missing opening question marks and a few literal renderings (e.g., \"se acuerda\") slightly reduce the naturalness for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present. No substantive content is lost; only minor typographical and punctuation errors are introduced, which do not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. Minor punctuation mistakes and a few slightly stiff phrasings prevent it from being completely fluent, but the readability, terminology handling, and completeness are strong. A small polish would bring it to near‑perfect quality.\nScore out of 20: 18/20 (average of the individual scores, rounded)."
