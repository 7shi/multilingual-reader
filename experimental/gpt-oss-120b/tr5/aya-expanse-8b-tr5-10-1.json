  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original dialogue structure. Most sentences convey the intended meaning, and the flow of the conversation is clear. However, occasional punctuation issues (mismatched quotes) and slightly awkward phrasing (e.g., \"La IA \\\"se recuerda\\\" de esta información\") require the reader to reread, which reduces smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural expressions and literal translations that feel foreign to native speakers. Examples include retaining French terms such as \"pré‑entrenamiento\" and \"ancrage\", mixing languages within a sentence, and the over‑use of quotation marks. These quirks break the natural rhythm of the text despite the overall meaning being intact.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is partially handled well (e.g., \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\"). Nevertheless, key terms are left in French (\"pré‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\", \"ancrage\" instead of \"anclaje\"), and English words like \"prompt\" appear without explanation. This inconsistency can confuse readers unfamiliar with the original language.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts the podcast style to Spanish reasonably well (e.g., \"¡Hola y bienvenidos a 'Tech Relámpago'\"). Cultural references are neutral, so no major issues arise. The main drawback is the leftover French terms, which slightly hinder the adaptation to a fully Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is omitted, and the dialogue maintains the same sequence of ideas. Minor redundancy appears in duplicated sentences, but this does not affect the completeness of the content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core content accurately and is easy to follow overall, but it suffers from fluency issues and inconsistent terminology. Cleaning up the mixed‑language terms, correcting punctuation, and using more natural Spanish phrasing would significantly improve the quality.\n\n**Total score:** 76/100 (out of 100, based on the sum of the five criteria)."
