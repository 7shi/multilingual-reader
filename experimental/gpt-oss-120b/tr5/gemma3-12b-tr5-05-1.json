  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the logical flow mirrors the original French script. A few minor hiccups (e.g., the colloquial “bachatear”) do not impede comprehension, but they slightly affect the smoothness for readers unfamiliar with that slang.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most parts and uses appropriate vocabulary. There are a few slightly awkward constructions (“una memoria de uso único”, “es una treta”) that feel a bit forced or overly informal, but overall a native speaker would find it fluent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “ventana de contexto”, “grounding”, etc. The occasional retention of English words such as *prompt* is acceptable in a tech‑focused podcast. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are neutral, and the speaker dynamics (Camille/Luc) are kept intact. Minor idiomatic choices (“una treta”) are a bit informal but do not distort meaning.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the concepts, analogies, and examples from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is lost or added, and the dialogue remains faithful to the source.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains a conversational tone, and is largely readable and natural for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Small stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but they do not detract from the overall effectiveness.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20.\n\nOverall score: 17"
