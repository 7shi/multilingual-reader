  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but the sentence structure is sometimes fragmented and punctuation is inconsistent. There are stray English markers (e.g., \"Or,\" \"becomes\") and duplicated speaker tags that interrupt the flow, making it harder for a reader to follow the conversation smoothly.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many expressions sound natural, especially the core technical explanations, but several phrases are overly literal or awkward (e.g., \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje contextual automatizado\", \"El pre‑entrenamiento\" with unnecessary article, duplicated quotation marks). The mix of English fragments and inconsistent use of quotation marks reduces the overall naturalness.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\" are correctly rendered and used consistently. The occasional retention of English words like \"prompt\" is acceptable given the context, and the translation of \"grounding\" as \"anclaje (grounding)\" is appropriate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and the explanatory tone, and it adapts the content for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor cultural or stylistic adjustments (e.g., using more idiomatic Spanish connectors) are missing, and the formatting issues slightly detract from the adaptation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the “memory” feature. Some minor glitches (extra English words, duplicated tags) do not omit substantive information, so completeness is largely retained.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and keeps the pedagogical style of the podcast. However, it suffers from formatting inconsistencies, occasional literalness, and a few awkward phrasings that hinder readability and fluency. Technical terminology is well handled, and the essential information is preserved, but polishing the prose and cleaning up speaker tags would significantly improve the final quality.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14 out of 20.\n\nRecommendation: Edit the text to remove duplicate speaker labels, fix punctuation, and smooth out the literal translations. This will raise both readability and fluency without affecting the already solid technical accuracy."
