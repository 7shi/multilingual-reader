    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original dialogue structure. Most sentences convey the intended ideas, and the flow of the conversation is clear. However, there are occasional awkward phrasings (e.g., “Imagínense que no enseñarían…”) and some leftover French terms that can momentarily confuse the reader. Overall, a native Spanish speaker could follow the content without major effort.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several non‑native constructions and inconsistent use of quotation marks. Phrases such as “pré-entrenamiento”, “afinamiento” (instead of the more common “ajuste fino”), and the duplicated sentence about “aprendizaje contextualizado automatizado” break the natural rhythm. Some verb tenses and prepositions are slightly off, making the text feel translated rather than originally written in Spanish.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved, but the handling is inconsistent. Words like “pré‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “ICL”, and especially “ancrage” remain in French, which may not be familiar to Spanish‑speaking readers. The translator sometimes provides a Spanish equivalent (e.g., “ventana de contexto”), but at other points leaves the French term untouched, reducing clarity. Consistency and occasional glosses would improve the terminology handling.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and explanatory tone, but cultural and linguistic adaptation is partial. Retaining French jargon (e.g., “pré‑entrenamiento”, “ancrage”) can feel out of place for a Spanish audience. Additionally, some idiomatic expressions are literal translations (“es como contratar a un consultor brillante”) that are acceptable but could be smoother. The overall purpose is conveyed, yet a more polished adaptation would enhance relevance for Spanish listeners.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. There is a minor duplication of a sentence about automated contextual learning, but no substantive loss of information. The translation is therefore largely complete.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transferring the technical content of the podcast into Spanish, and a reader can grasp the main ideas. Nonetheless, the text suffers from occasional non‑native phrasing, inconsistent treatment of technical terms (some remain in French), and minor redundancy. Improving fluency, standardising terminology (e.g., using “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “anclaje”) and smoothing idiomatic expressions would raise the overall quality to a more native‑like level."
