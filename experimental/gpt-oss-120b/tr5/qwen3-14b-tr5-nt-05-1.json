  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are mostly short and the dialogue format is preserved. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia and aprendizaje en contexto are explained in clear language. A few isolated lines (e.g., \"El preentrenamiento.\") feel a bit abrupt, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most of the script, but there are a few literal renderings that feel slightly stiff. \"El afinado\" is less idiomatic than \"ajuste fino\"; \"consultor brillante\" is acceptable but a bit formal for a podcast tone; some sentences are a little wordy (e.g., \"simplemente se le ha dado una nota previa justo antes de que comenzara a hablar contigo\"). Overall, a native speaker would understand it easily, though a native‑speaker editor could smooth the phrasing.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally handled correctly: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding (anclaje). Consistency is good, but the choice of \"afinado\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\" may cause slight confusion for readers familiar with the literature. Nonetheless, the meaning is clear.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone and podcast‑style banter. Cultural references are neutral, and the examples (consultant, bicicleta) are adapted well to Spanish. No expressions feel out of place for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is retained. No major ideas are omitted, and the explanatory details (e.g., how \"memoria\" features work) are fully conveyed. Redundancy is minimal and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the original French podcast accurately and maintains a clear, understandable narrative. While the wording is generally good, a few lexical choices (like \"afinado\") and slightly literal constructions prevent it from feeling completely native. Minor editorial polishing would raise fluency, but the technical content and overall message are preserved very well.\nOverall score reflects the average of the individual criteria, indicating a solid translation with room for stylistic improvement.\n\nOverall score (out of 20): 17\n\n---\n**Scoring Summary**\n- Readability: 17/20\n- Fluency: 15/20\n- Terminology: 16/20\n- Contextual Adaptation: 18/20\n- Information Completeness: 20/20\n- **Total / Average:** 17/20"
