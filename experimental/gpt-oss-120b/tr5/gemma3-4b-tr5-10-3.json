    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are easy to follow. Most sentences are clear and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained in accessible language. Minor issues such as the typo “Imaginén” and the inserted “¿Entonces? / ¿Aclaración? / ¿Qué quieres decir?” slightly interrupt the smoothness, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, using appropriate colloquial expressions and correct syntax. A few grammatical slips (e.g., “las conocimientos”, “las nuevas conocimientos”, misuse of gender) and occasional overly literal renderings (e.g., “bachotaje” which is region‑specific) make the text feel slightly less native‑like. Overall, a native speaker would understand it without effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and “grounding” rendered as “anclaje (enraizamiento)”. The terms are consistent throughout and appropriate for a general‑audience podcast. Minor gender agreement errors do not affect term accuracy.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The informal podcast tone is preserved, with conversational interjections that fit Spanish‑speaking audiences. Cultural references are neutral, and the translation adapts the analogy of a consultant and a student effectively. The only slight mismatch is the use of “bachotaje”, which may be unfamiliar to some Spanish speakers, but it still conveys the intended meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is retained. No major ideas or examples are omitted, and the added clarification “¿Entonces? / ¿Aclaración? / ¿Qué quieres decir?” does not remove content. The translation is comprehensive and faithful to the source.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is strong: it conveys the technical content clearly, maintains the podcast’s conversational style, and uses appropriate terminology. Minor grammatical slips and a few stylistic quirks prevent a perfect score, but they do not detract significantly from comprehension or accuracy. The translation would be well‑understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners of a tech podcast.\nScore: 88/100 (average 17.6 ≈ 18)."
