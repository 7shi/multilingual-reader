  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original French dialogue. Listeners can understand the concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning without major obstacles. Minor issues such as the use of “las informaciones” instead of the more natural “la información”, occasional missing accents (¿Porque?) and a few awkward interrogatives slightly affect smooth comprehension, but they do not impede overall understanding.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, yet several expressions betray non‑native constructions: “afinado” (Portuguese), “las informaciones”, “el system”, and the inconsistent use of “vuestras” vs. “sus”. These create a slightly stilted feeling for native Spanish speakers. Apart from these spots, the dialogue is fluid and the conversational tone is preserved.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered in most cases (preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL). The translation of “fine‑tuning” varies between “afinado” and “afinamiento”, which is not the standard Spanish term (“ajuste fino” or “afinación”), causing a small inconsistency. Nevertheless, the core terminology remains understandable.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent, humor and pedagogical style of the original podcast are well preserved. Cultural references are neutral, and the explanation of concepts is adapted appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The few lexical oddities do not detract from the overall message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No relevant content is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary material. The structure of the dialogue is maintained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is accurate and conveys the original content effectively. It succeeds in keeping the educational tone and the step‑by‑step explanation of AI learning methods. The main drawbacks are a handful of unnatural word choices and minor grammatical slips that slightly reduce fluency. With a quick editorial pass to replace terms like “afinado”, “las informaciones” and “el system”, the text would read like a native‑level podcast script.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
