  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally understandable and follows the original flow. Most sentences are clear, but there are occasional awkward phrasings (e.g., “Imaginad que enviamos una nueva IA a la escuela”, “Lo ya entiende los conceptos…”) and mismatched quotation marks that slightly disrupt smooth reading.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads fairly naturally for a native Spanish speaker, preserving the conversational tone of a podcast. Nevertheless, literal translations such as “sugerencia” for “prompt”, the informal “chuleta”, and occasional grammatical slips reduce the overall fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinado”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “anclaje”. The only notable deviation is the translation of “prompt” as “sugerencia”, which is not the standard term used in the AI community. Consistency is otherwise good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent, keeps the podcast style, and adapts cultural references appropriately. Minor issues (e.g., occasional overly literal phrasing) do not impede the message. Overall, the adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience is successful.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted, and the explanations remain faithful to the source. Minor typographic quirks do not affect content completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the original podcast’s content accurately and maintains the educational, conversational tone. While readability and fluency are good overall, a few literal renderings and minor grammatical slips prevent it from being perfectly smooth. Technical terminology is mostly well‑chosen, though “prompt” could be better translated. The adaptation to the target audience is effective, and the information is complete. The translation is solid but could benefit from a final polish to improve naturalness and consistency.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20.\n\nScore: 16"
