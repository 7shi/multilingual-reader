    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version presents the ideas in a logical order and uses clear sentences. Most technical concepts are explained in plain language, making the content easy to follow for a non‑expert audience. Minor issues such as occasional double‑spacing and the insertion of multiple possible translations for a single French phrase slightly disrupt flow, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural and conversational, appropriate for a podcast. There are a few awkward constructions (e.g., “Se podría decir eso.”, the mix of English terms like *prompt* and “grounding”, and the redundant list of alternative Spanish questions) that feel slightly stilted to native speakers. Overall, fluency is high but not flawless.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled well: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto* are accurate. The term *fine‑tuning* is translated inconsistently as both “fine‑tuning” and “ajuste fino”, and English words such as *prompt* and “grounding” are left untranslated, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the jargon. Consistency could be improved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the informal podcast tone to Spanish effectively, using familiar pronouns and colloquial phrasing. Cultural references are preserved, and the explanation of concepts is suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only drawback is the insertion of multiple alternative phrasings for “¿Qué quieres decir?” which is unnecessary and may distract the listener.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the added parenthetical alternatives do not remove any meaning. The translation is therefore fully complete.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is very good. It conveys the full technical content clearly and maintains the engaging podcast style. Minor inconsistencies in terminology and occasional redundant phrasing prevent it from being perfect, but the text is readable, fluent, and faithful to the source.\n\nStrengths: accurate conveyance of concepts, natural conversational tone, complete coverage of the original material.\nWeaknesses: inconsistent handling of the term *fine‑tuning*, retention of some English jargon, and the unnecessary inclusion of multiple alternative Spanish questions that slightly clutter the dialogue.\n\nWith a few refinements—standardising technical terms and trimming redundant alternatives—the translation would reach near‑native quality.\n\nScore: 89/100 (average 17.8/20)."
