  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained clearly with analogías que facilitan la comprensión. Only a few sentences are slightly long, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places and uses appropriate colloquial language for a podcast (e.g., “¡Exacto!”, “¡Una analogía perfecta!”). A couple of expressions feel a bit forced, such as “ventana de contexto” (still understandable but not the most common phrasing) and “Da la impresión de que realmente están comenzando a recordar cosas de una sesión a otra”, which could be smoother. Overall, the flow is good.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is consistently rendered: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”, “anclaje (grounding)”. The translator kept the English acronyms when useful and provided Spanish equivalents, which helps the target audience. No major mistranslations of technical concepts are present.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose of the podcast. It adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., “consultor brillante” instead of “consultant”). The Spanish version feels like a native‑speaking podcast script, maintaining the conversational dynamic between Camille and Luc.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No key ideas or examples have been omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary material. The content remains concise yet complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the lively podcast style, and is largely fluent and readable. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve naturalness, but the text succeeds in delivering the original message to a Spanish‑speaking audience.\nScore breakdown: Readability 18, Fluency 17, Terminology 19, Contextual Adaptation 18, Information Completeness 19. The average yields an overall rating of 18/20.\n\n**Overall Score**: 18/20"
