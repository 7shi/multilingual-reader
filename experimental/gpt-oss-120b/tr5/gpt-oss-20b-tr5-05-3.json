  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear order. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia e ICL are explained with suitable analogías (graduado universitario, consultor brillante, bachotaje). Minor hiccups like “Piense en lugar de:” slightly break the flow, but overall a Spanish‑speaking listener can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary (e.g., “ventana de contexto”, “memoria a corto plazo”). A few constructions feel a bit forced or literal (“una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”, “Piense en lugar de:”), but they do not impede comprehension. Overall the language sounds like a native speaker wrote it.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), grounding → anclaje, memoria. The translator kept consistency across the script and did not introduce wrong jargon. Where a term could be obscure, a brief explanation is provided (e.g., “ventana de contexto”).",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and tone of a podcast conversation, preserving the informal, didactic style. Cultural references are neutral, so no adaptation was needed, and the translator kept the playful analogies. Minor style issues (use of « » for “Memoria”) are negligible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No content has been omitted, and no unnecessary repetitions were added. The translation even keeps the bracketed “pre‑entrenamiento” hyphenation, matching the original. Therefore the information is complete.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is very good. It conveys the technical content clearly, uses appropriate terminology, and maintains the conversational tone of the podcast. Minor literal renderings and a couple of slightly awkward phrases prevent a perfect score, but they do not affect comprehension. The work demonstrates strong competence in both languages and in handling AI‑related terminology.\n\nScore (average of the five criteria): 18.4 ≈ 18/20.\n\nOverall rating: 18/20."
