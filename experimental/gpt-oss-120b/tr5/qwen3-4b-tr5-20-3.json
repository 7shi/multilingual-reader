    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the original structure. Most sentences convey the intended meaning, and the technical concepts are explained clearly. However, a few awkward phrases (e.g., “cramar” for “cram”) and minor grammatical slips slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several non‑idiomatic expressions and minor errors: “Hola y bienvenido/a en” should be “Hola y bienvenidos a”, “el aprendizaje en contexto es como cramar” is incorrect, and occasional missing accent marks or punctuation make the prose feel a bit forced. Overall, a native Spanish speaker can follow it, but the flow is not completely smooth.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well. “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento (fine‑tuning)”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (Aprendizaje en contexto)”, and “grounding (anclaje)” are correctly rendered and consistently used. The term “prompt” is left untranslated, which is acceptable for a technical audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural adaptation is mostly adequate, though a few phrasing choices (e.g., “consultor brillante”) feel literal translations rather than natural Spanish equivalents. The overall message and persuasive style are retained.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the sequence of arguments is maintained. Minor punctuation differences do not affect the conveyed content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content and the conversational style of the original podcast. It excels in terminology consistency and completeness, but fluency suffers from a handful of non‑idiomatic expressions and small grammatical errors that slightly reduce readability. With minor revisions to phrasing (especially “cramar” and the opening greeting), the text would read like a native‑speaker podcast script.\nOverall score: 86/100."
