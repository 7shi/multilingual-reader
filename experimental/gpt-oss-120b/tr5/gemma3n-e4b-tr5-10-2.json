  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clearly expressed. However, there are a few typographical errors (e.g., \"pre-entrerenamiento\" instead of \"preentrenamiento\"), some inconsistent punctuation, and occasional overly long sentences that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, but there are occasional awkward constructions such as \"Piensen en esto\" (mixed register) and the use of \"Podéis\" which may feel region‑specific. Minor grammatical slips (missing accents, misplaced commas) reduce the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", etc. The term *prompt* is left in its original form, which is appropriate for a technical audience. Consistency is good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast style well, preserving the conversational tone. A few cultural mismatches appear (use of \"Podéis\" versus a neutral \"pueden\", and the final brand name changes from \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Tech Flash\"), but they do not alter the intended meaning.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original script is present. No major ideas are omitted, and the examples (English‑French transfer, memory vs. fine‑tuning) are retained. Minor typographical errors do not affect the conveyed content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the technical concepts clearly. It reads well for a Spanish‑speaking audience, with only a handful of small errors and stylistic inconsistencies that could be polished. The terminology is spot‑on, and the meaning of the original podcast is preserved throughout.\n\nStrengths: correct technical terms, faithful to source, good level of detail. Areas for improvement: fix typos, smooth out occasional awkward phrasing, keep brand names consistent, and adopt a uniform register throughout the dialogue.\n\nThe translation would be easily understood by listeners familiar with AI topics, and it maintains the engaging, informal podcast tone effectively.\n\nScore out of 20 (average of criteria): 16.8 → 17"
