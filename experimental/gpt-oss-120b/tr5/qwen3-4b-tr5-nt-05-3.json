  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is hard to follow because each line of dialogue is preceded by long, numbered meta‑annotations (e.g., “1. **Vocabulaire clé et expressions**”). These blocks break the natural flow of a spoken podcast, forcing the reader to sift through irrelevant explanations before getting to the actual conversation. Sentence structures are occasionally tangled, and the presence of technical footnotes makes the text feel more like a teaching guide than a script. Consequently, a native‑speaker listener would struggle to comprehend the dialogue smoothly.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Numerous expressions sound artificial or outright incorrect. Examples include “antiespuma” for the French “antisèche”, “preentrenamiento” inconsistently capitalised, and awkward constructions such as “la IA no ha olvidado en el sentido humano; su espacio de trabajo temporal simplemente ha sido vaciado.” The insertion of English fragments (“Simply utiliza…”) and the mix of Spanish, French and English terms further disrupts fluency. Overall the text does not read as natural Spanish.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms (pré‑entraînement, fine‑tuning, ICL, fenêtre de contexte) are mostly rendered correctly (preentrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje en contexto), but the surrounding explanatory brackets introduce inconsistent terminology and sometimes wrong translations (e.g., “antiespuma”). The translation also fails to keep term usage consistent throughout, and the meta‑comments repeat definitions that were not present in the original script, which distracts rather than clarifies.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original podcast is a conversational, informal exposition. The translation turns it into a dense, annotated document aimed at language learners, which does not match the intended audience. Cultural references are largely untouched, but the added pedagogical notes are unnecessary and sometimes inaccurate, showing a lack of adaptation to the target context of a spoken podcast.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All core ideas from the French version are present, but they are buried under the annotation blocks. Some nuances are lost or distorted (e.g., “antiespuma” instead of “cheat‑sheet”, “memoria a corto plazo” vs. “ventana de contexto”). Redundancies from the original are amplified by the added bullet points, while the essential conversational tone is omitted.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is far from a faithful, listener‑friendly rendering of the original podcast. It mixes a literal translation with extensive instructional annotations that were not part of the source, resulting in poor readability, unnatural phrasing, and occasional mistranslations of key terms. To be usable, the text would need to be stripped of the meta‑comments, corrected for lexical errors, and rewritten in a smooth, conversational Spanish style that mirrors the tone of the original French dialogue."
