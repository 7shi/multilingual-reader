  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured, and complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can grasp. Minor hiccups (e.g., \"el sillón\" instead of \"la silla\") do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but a few expressions feel slightly awkward for a native speaker: “El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje” (unusual phrasing), “el sillón” for “the seat”, and occasional over‑use of commas. These issues are minor and do not break the flow, but they prevent a perfect rating.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly and consistently. Terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"ICL (aprendizaje en contexto)\" are accurately rendered, and the occasional English acronym is retained with a clear Spanish explanation. The only minor point is the hyphenation of \"pre‑entrenamiento\" which could be \"preentrenamiento\" in Spanish.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish well, using colloquial expressions like \"chuleta\" that fit the target audience. Cultural references are preserved, and the dialogue maintains its lively, conversational style. A couple of small phrasing choices could be smoother, but the overall intent and register are effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No key points are omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as in the source. Redundancies are avoided, and the content stays concise while preserving nuance.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It delivers the technical content clearly and maintains the informal, podcast‑like atmosphere of the original. Minor fluency glitches prevent a perfect score, but they do not detract significantly from overall comprehension or accuracy.\n\nOverall score (sum of the five criteria): 91/100."
