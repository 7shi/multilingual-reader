  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the explanations of pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto are presented in a logical order. Minor punctuation quirks do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are a few hiccups: the acronym \"ICL\" is mistakenly rendered as \"AIC\" later in the dialogue, and a couple of sentences feel slightly literal (e.g., \"El pre‑entrenamiento.\" as a standalone line). These issues break the smoothness expected from native‑speaker prose.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely accurate: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly used. The only inconsistency is the wrong acronym (AIC instead of ICL), which could confuse readers familiar with the field.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original content well to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using appropriate idioms (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", \"hoja de trucos\"). Cultural references are preserved and the tone matches the original podcast style.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are retained; no substantive information is omitted. The only minor loss is the acronym error, which does not delete content but affects precision.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast’s explanations of AI training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning very effectively. Readability and completeness are strong, and the terminology is mostly spot‑on. The main drawbacks are a few fluency slips, especially the inconsistent use of the ICL acronym, which slightly detracts from the professional polish. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation that would be easily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners interested in AI concepts.\n\nScore out of 20 (average of the five criteria): 17.6 → 18."
