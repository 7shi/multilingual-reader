  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences are easy to follow, and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained with suitable examples. Minor punctuation issues (misplaced quotes, stray punctuation) and occasional awkward phrasing slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native speaker overall, but there are a few literal renderings and odd constructions (e.g., “Pueden tomar un modelo…”, “Da la sensación de que realmente comienzan a recordar cosas”). The use of informal plural \"Imaginad\" fits a Spanish‑European audience, yet occasional English terms (ICL) are left untranslated, which is acceptable in a technical context. Overall fluency is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled consistently: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\" (instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\"), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\". The terms are appropriate for a technically‑savvy audience, though \"afinamiento\" may be less familiar than the standard translation. No major inconsistencies are found.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts the style to Spanish speakers (use of \"Imaginad\", \"chuleta\", informal tone). Cultural references are kept neutral, and the explanation of memory features is conveyed clearly. Slightly formal‑informal mix is present but does not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No relevant details are omitted, and the examples and analogies are kept intact. Redundancies are minimal and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency shows minor rough edges. Terminology could be refined (e.g., using \"ajuste fino\"), and punctuation should be cleaned up, but overall the Spanish version is effective and faithful to the original content.\nOverall score (out of 100): 85/100."
