  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the logical flow of the original dialogue. Most sentences convey the intended ideas, but occasional literal renderings (e.g., “por lo tanto, después del preentrenamiento, la IA es como un recién graduado universitario”) and leftover editorial notes (“Translation:”) create brief moments of confusion, lowering smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several awkward constructions and mixed‑language artifacts break the flow. Phrases such as “AIC (Aprendizaje en Contexto)” (the original abbreviation was ICL), the insertion of the English word “prompt”, and the literal “Translation: Exactamente.” make the text feel less native‑like.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, etc. The only notable inconsistency is the change of the abbreviation ICL to AIC, which could confuse readers familiar with the English literature. Overall terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural adaptation is minimal but adequate (e.g., “Buenos días” for “Bonjour”). Small literal translations and the stray English markers slightly reduce the natural adaptation to Spanish‑speaking audiences.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, temporary vs permanent knowledge, and the “memory” feature. Minor issues include the unnecessary “Translation:” tag and the abbreviation mismatch, but no substantive content is lost.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the substance of the original podcast accurately and is largely readable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Nevertheless, it suffers from a few literal renderings, editorial leftovers, and an inconsistent abbreviation for In‑Context Learning, which prevent it from feeling fully polished. With a bit of editing to remove stray English markers and to smooth out awkward phrasing, the text would reach a higher level of naturalness and clarity.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 14.4 ≈ 14/20."
