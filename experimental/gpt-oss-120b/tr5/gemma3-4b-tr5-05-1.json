  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and follows a logical flow. Complex ideas are explained in an accessible way, and the dialogue format is preserved. Minor issues such as missing accent marks (e.g., “Ahi” instead of “Ahí”) and occasional shifts between formal and informal pronouns slightly affect smooth reading, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most of the passage, using appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic expressions. A few phrases feel slightly awkward (“Los conocimientos que usted proporciona” vs. a more natural “Los conocimientos que proporcionas”) and there are small typographic errors (missing accents, inconsistent punctuation). Overall, a native speaker would understand it easily, but the fluency is not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”, and “grounding” are all rendered consistently. The translator chose appropriate Spanish equivalents and kept English terms in parentheses where helpful. No important term is mistranslated or omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts the content for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The consultant analogy and the discussion of memory features are preserved. However, the mix of formal “usted” and informal “tú” pronouns creates a slight inconsistency in register, and some cultural nuances (e.g., “bachoteo”) could be clarified for broader audiences. These issues prevent a perfect adaptation score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is maintained. Minor stylistic repetitions are avoided, and the translation does not add unnecessary content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality and conveys the technical discussion accurately. The main drawbacks are minor typographic errors, occasional inconsistency in formality, and a few slightly stiff phrasings. With a quick proofread to fix accents and harmonize the pronoun usage, the text would reach a near‑perfect level of readability and fluency."
