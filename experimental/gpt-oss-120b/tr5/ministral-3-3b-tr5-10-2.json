  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the flow of ideas follows the original. However, there are occasional missing punctuation marks, missing question marks, and a few clunky sentences that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural to native speakers (e.g., “Los lenguas son un excelente ejemplo”, “Podéis tomar…”, mixed use of English acronyms without explanation). There are also mismatched verb forms and occasional literal translations that feel stiff. Overall, the translation is functional but not fully idiomatic.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “afinado”, “ventana de contexto”, and “aprendizaje en contexto” are correctly rendered. The translation of “transfer learning” as “entrenamiento por transferencia” is appropriate. Minor issues appear with gender agreement (“los lenguas”) and the decision to keep some English terms (ICL, grounding) without full Spanish equivalents, but the terminology is largely accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast intro to Spanish (“¡Hola y bienvenidos a ‘Tech Flash’”) but later reverts to the original French title, creating inconsistency. Cultural references are minimal, which is fine, but the switch between Spanish and French names can confuse the target audience. Overall, the intent is preserved, but the adaptation could be smoother.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the notion of temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. Minor nuances (e.g., the rhetorical question “C’est une astuce ?”) are paraphrased rather than directly translated, but no essential information is lost.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and is largely complete, but it suffers from occasional awkward phrasing, inconsistent naming, and minor grammatical slips that affect fluency and readability. Technical terminology is well‑handled, though a few gender errors and untranslated English terms remain. With a bit more polishing for naturalness and consistency, the Spanish version would be much stronger.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
