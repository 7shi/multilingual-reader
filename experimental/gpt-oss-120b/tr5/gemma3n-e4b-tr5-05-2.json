    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clearly presented. Most sentences are logical and the flow mirrors the original. However, there are a few typographical errors (e.g., “recién graduad ouniversitario”, “artĩña”) and inconsistent use of pronouns (“podéis” vs “puedes”) that slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, using appropriate Spanish constructions. Nonetheless, occasional awkward phrasing (“una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”), mixed registers and the stray characters mentioned above make it feel less polished than native speech.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje (grounding) are all correctly rendered. The term “prompt” is left in English but is a common practice in the field, and no key term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original intent appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the explanations remain faithful. Minor issues such as the inconsistent use of ‘tú/vosotros’ slightly affect cohesion, but overall the adaptation is successful.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is retained. No significant content is omitted, and the logical progression of the discussion is preserved. The only drawbacks are typographical glitches, which do not remove information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality and conveys the technical content accurately. Minor typographical errors, occasional inconsistencies in pronoun use, and a few slightly stiff phrasings prevent a perfect score, but the reader will understand the material without difficulty. The handling of terminology and preservation of meaning are strong points. With a quick proofread to fix the small errors, the text would be near‑native in fluency and readability.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
