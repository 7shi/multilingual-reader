  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the explanations of concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto are clear. Minor typographic issues (e.g., “pre‑entrenamiento” vs. “preentrenamiento”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but a few expressions feel slightly forced or literal: “estudiar de último momento” would be more idiomatic as “estudiar de última hora”, and the acronym change from ICL to AIC may confuse native speakers. The use of “antisèche” (a French term) is retained instead of a Spanish equivalent like “chuleta”. These issues keep the fluency from being perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely well‑handled: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, ventana de contexto, grounding, etc. Consistency is good, but the acronym for In‑Context Learning is altered to “AIC”, which is not standard and could mislead readers. This inconsistency lowers the score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts the discourse to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are appropriate, though the retention of the French word “antisèche” slightly reduces cultural adaptation. Otherwise, the tone and style fit a podcast script well.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present: explanation of pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, afinamiento vs. aprendizaje en contexto, la diferencia entre memoria temporal y permanente, y la descripción de la funcionalidad de “Memoria”. No relevant information is omitted.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content clearly. Minor issues with idiomatic phrasing, the unexpected acronym change, and the leftover French term prevent it from being flawless, but the overall quality is high and suitable for the intended audience.\n\nScore breakdown: readability 18, fluency 16, terminology 15, contextual adaptation 17, information completeness 19. The average yields a final rating of 17/20.\n\nOverall rating: 17/20."
