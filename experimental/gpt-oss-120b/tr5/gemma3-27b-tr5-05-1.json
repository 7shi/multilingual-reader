  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the flow of ideas mirrors the original French script. The only minor hiccup is the retention of the French word *ancrage* without translation, which could momentarily confuse readers unfamiliar with the term.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part and uses appropriate everyday vocabulary. A few expressions are slightly awkward – e.g., “el aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje” (more natural would be “es como el bachotaje”) and the occasional literal rendering of English acronyms. These do not impede comprehension but prevent full native‑speaker fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely handled correctly: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL*. The French term *ancrage* is left untranslated, and the Spanish equivalent *anclaje* would be preferable. Overall consistency is good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator kept the podcast’s informal, conversational tone and adapted cultural references (e.g., “consultor brillante”). The only cultural mismatch is the untranslated French term mentioned above, but it does not affect the overall intent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original dialogue is present. No ideas are omitted, and the explanatory analogies are retained. The translation even preserves parenthetical clarifications (e.g., “grounding”).",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical concepts clearly, retains the original’s engaging style, and is largely faithful to the source. Minor issues – an untranslated French term and a couple of slightly stiff phrasings – keep it from being perfect, but they do not detract significantly from comprehension or usefulness.\n\nThe translation would benefit from a quick review to replace *ancrage* with *anclaje* and smooth out a few idiomatic expressions, after which it would read as a fully natural Spanish podcast script.\n\nScore out of 100: 88/100.\n\nScore: 88"
