  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the logical flow of the original podcast. Most sentences are clear, and complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in accessible language. A few minor issues (e.g., a missing “Exactamente” after Luc’s line and occasional abrupt speaker tags) slightly hinder smooth comprehension, but they do not break the overall message.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several grammar slips that a native speaker would notice: the gender of \"IA\" is inconsistently used (\"el IA\" vs \"la IA\"), the phrase \"Luc: ajuste fino\" appears as a speaker label instead of dialogue, and some constructions are a bit stiff (e.g., \"una cantidad masiva de datos en Internet\" vs the more idiomatic \"una enorme cantidad de datos de Internet\"). These affect fluency without rendering the text unintelligible.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally well handled. \"Preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"anclaje\" are appropriate. The abbreviation ICL is replaced by \"AEC\", which is acceptable but a note could be added to keep the original acronym for readers familiar with the literature. The inconsistency in gender for \"IA\" is a minor terminology flaw.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a conversational podcast. Cultural references are neutral, and the Spanish version uses familiar phrasing for the target audience. The only drawback is the misplaced speaker line \"Luc: ajuste fino\" which slightly changes the flow, but overall the adaptation is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary nature of prompt‑based knowledge, and the “memory” feature trick. No substantive content is omitted, though the brief loss of Luc’s interjection \"Exactement\" reduces a tiny amount of emphasis.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the podcast’s content accurately and maintains a clear structure. It handles technical terminology competently, and the overall message is intact. However, recurring gender errors with \"IA\", a misplaced speaker tag, and a few awkward phrasings prevent it from reaching a fully native‑like level. Minor editorial corrections would bring the translation to a higher quality tier.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
