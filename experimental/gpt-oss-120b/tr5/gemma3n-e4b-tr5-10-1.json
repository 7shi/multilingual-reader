  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are clear. Minor typographical errors (e.g., “pre‑entrerenamiento”) do not impede comprehension, but they slightly lower the score.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most of the script. However, there are a few awkward expressions and misspellings such as “artiñaña” (should be *artimaña*) and “Transformeers”. These hiccups prevent a fully fluent feel.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, etc. The choices are appropriate for a general‑audience podcast and no crucial term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original French are preserved. The adaptation to Spanish‑speaking listeners is adequate, though the brand name changes from “Tech Éclair” to “Tech Flash”, which is an unnecessary deviation, and a few regionalisms (vuestras) appear but are acceptable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original dialogue is retained. No content is omitted or incorrectly added, and the translation conveys the full technical narrative.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality and conveys the technical discussion clearly. Minor typographical errors, a couple of awkward word choices, and an unnecessary brand name change keep it from being perfect, but the core message and terminology are well preserved.\nScore out of 20 points: 18"
