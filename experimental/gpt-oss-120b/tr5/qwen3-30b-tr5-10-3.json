  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is riddled with out‑of‑place interjections (\"Hola\", \"Hola, mundo\", \"Por favor, escribe en español.\") and placeholder messages (\"El texto no contiene una traducción en español que extraer.\") that break the flow. Many sentences are incomplete or nonsensical, making it very hard for a Spanish‑speaking reader to follow the discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation does not sound natural. It mixes Spanish with English fragments, repeats the word \"Hola\" unnecessarily, and contains abrupt, machine‑generated artefacts. Grammar is often incorrect or missing, resulting in a stilted and disjointed text.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are present, but many are left untranslated or incorrectly rendered (e.g., \"hola\" used instead of a proper continuation). Some concepts are completely lost, and the inconsistent handling harms the technical clarity.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original podcast tone and explanatory style are not preserved. The translation inserts irrelevant prompts and system messages, which distort the intent and make the conversation sound like a broken chat log rather than a polished podcast script. Cultural adaptation is absent.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are missing or replaced by placeholder text (e.g., \"El texto no contiene una traducción en español que extraer.\"). Important explanations about memory, grounding, and the difference between fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are omitted or garbled, resulting in severe loss of information.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is far from acceptable. It fails to convey the original content in a clear, fluent, and complete manner. Numerous technical sections are corrupted by system artefacts, and the overall readability is extremely low. A complete re‑translation by a human translator familiar with AI terminology is required.\n\nOverall Score (out of 100): 16"
