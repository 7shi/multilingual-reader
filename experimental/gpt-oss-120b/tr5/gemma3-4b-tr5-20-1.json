  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. The only minor drawback is the insertion of three alternative questions (\"¿Entonces? / ¿A eso te refieres? / ¿Qué quieres decir?\") which can momentarily confuse the reader.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic (e.g., \"es como enviar a este graduado\", \"como contratar a un consultor brillante\"). A few small issues affect fluency: the hyphenated \"pre‑entrenamiento\" is less common than \"preentrenamiento\", and the list of alternative questions is awkward in a spoken‑podcast script. Overall, the flow is smooth.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje (grounding)\", \"prompt\", etc. The occasional use of the English word \"prompt\" is acceptable for a tech‑savvy audience. Consistency is maintained throughout the text.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast conversation, using Spanish‑friendly analogies and expressions. Cultural references are neutral, which works for a broad Spanish‑speaking audience. No major mis‑adaptations were found.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is lost, and the translation does not add irrelevant material (apart from the three optional questions, which are redundant but not harmful).",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical explanations clearly, uses appropriate terminology, and maintains the conversational style of the original podcast. Minor issues such as the redundant question list and a few stylistic choices prevent it from being perfect, but the text is fully understandable and faithful to the source.\n\nStrengths: accurate terminology, clear exposition of complex ideas, good adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience.\nWeaknesses: occasional awkward phrasing and a redundant multi‑question segment that could be streamlined.\n\nThe translation would be very effective for its intended listeners, requiring only minimal editing for polish.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
