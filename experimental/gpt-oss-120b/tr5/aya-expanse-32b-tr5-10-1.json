  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor hiccups – the use of the French word *bachotage* and the occasional switch between *aprendizaje en contexto* and *aprendizaje in‑context* – slightly disrupt flow but do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places and uses appropriate colloquial Spanish. A few expressions feel slightly awkward (e.g., “simplemente se le ha proporcionado un apunte” or the retention of French terms) and there is a small inconsistency with the podcast name at the end. Overall, the text reads smoothly for a native speaker.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is well‑handled: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)*, *anclaje*, *memoria* are all correctly rendered. The only drawback is the untranslated French term *bachotage*, which could have been replaced by a Spanish equivalent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French podcast script to a Spanish‑speaking audience effectively. Cultural references are maintained, the tone stays informal and educational, and the title is rendered as *Tech Relámpago* (except for a final slip back to the French title). This minor inconsistency does not affect the overall intent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original script is present. No key points are omitted, and the technical explanations remain intact. The only redundancy is the mixed use of the podcast name at the very end.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, keeps the conversational tone, and is largely readable and natural. The main areas for improvement are eliminating the few remaining French terms and ensuring consistent naming of the podcast throughout. Overall, it would serve Spanish listeners well and requires only minor polishing."
