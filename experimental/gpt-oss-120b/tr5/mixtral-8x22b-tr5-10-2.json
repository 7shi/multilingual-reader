  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clearly expressed. Most sentences flow logically, and complex concepts such as transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in a way a non‑expert can grasp. Minor issues (e.g., the use of “Camila” instead of “Camille”, the odd phrase “el afino” instead of “el afinamiento”) slightly disrupt comprehension but do not prevent understanding.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, with appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic phrasing. There are a few awkward constructions – notably “el afino” and the inconsistent abbreviation “AIC (Aprendizaje In‑Context)” – which feel less native. Overall, the prose is smooth and would be comfortable for a Spanish‑speaking listener.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely well‑handled: pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, anclaje, prompt, etc. However, the translation introduces inconsistencies (\"afino\" vs \"afinamiento\", \"AIC\" instead of the standard ICL/\"aprendizaje en contexto\"). These could cause mild confusion for readers familiar with the field.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original podcast are preserved. The adaptation respects Spanish‑speaking audience expectations, using a suitable register and occasional cultural adaptation (e.g., the name “Camila”). The only drawback is the mixed abbreviation, which is a minor deviation from optimal adaptation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No relevant segment is omitted, and the flow of arguments remains intact. The only losses are the subtle nuances linked to the incorrect abbreviations, which do not affect the factual content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the original content accurately. Readability and completeness are strong, while fluency and terminology could be polished by fixing the few inconsistent terms and abbreviations. The translation would be well‑understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts, though a minor edit pass would raise it to a near‑perfect level.\n\n**Overall score:** 16/20 (average of the five criteria)."
