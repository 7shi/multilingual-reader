    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow for most readers. Sentences are generally logical and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor punctuation quirks and occasional long sentences slightly affect flow, but comprehension is not impaired.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few expressions feel awkward to native speakers (e.g., “del ‘bachotage’”, “detrás de bambalinas”, inconsistent use of “afinamiento” vs. “refinamiento”). Vocabulary is appropriate overall, yet those hiccups prevent a fully native feel.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto* and *ICL* are correctly rendered. The English loanword *prompt* is kept, which is acceptable in current AI discourse. Inconsistency appears between “refinamiento” and “afinamiento”, but the meaning stays clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone and pedagogical style. Cultural references are adapted well (e.g., “consultor brillante”). The only slight mismatch is the literal translation of “bachotage”, which may be obscure for Spanish‑speaking audiences.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant omissions or added redundancies are detected. The content remains as comprehensive as the source.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. Minor fluency issues and inconsistent terminology prevent it from being completely natural, but readability and completeness are high. It would benefit from smoothing a few awkward phrases and standardising the term for fine‑tuning throughout the text.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 16, Fluency 15, Terminology 17, Contextual Adaptation 16, Information Completeness 19. Total: 83/100.\n\nThe translation is suitable for a knowledgeable Spanish‑speaking audience, with only modest polishing needed to reach native‑level polish."
