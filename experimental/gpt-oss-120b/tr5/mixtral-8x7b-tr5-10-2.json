  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated document is a jumble of fragmented sentences, interspersed English, French and Spanish, with many stray meta‑comments and code‑like snippets. A Spanish‑speaking reader would be unable to follow the narrative at all.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish that does appear is often ungrammatical, uses wrong conjugations, odd word order, and many literal translations that sound unnatural. The presence of English words (e.g., \"prompt\", \"ICL\") and French fragments further breaks fluency.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑training\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"in‑context learning\", \"window de contexte\", etc., are inconsistently translated, sometimes left in French, sometimes in English, and sometimes incorrectly rendered in Spanish. The terminology is therefore unreliable.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent—to thank listeners and announce the next episode—gets lost in a sea of unrelated translation attempts. The final sentence is the only part that roughly matches the intended closing, but the rest fails to convey the podcast’s educational tone.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original French dialogue is missing, replaced by isolated vocabulary lists, code blocks, and unrelated explanations. Essential content about pre‑training, transfer learning, and in‑context learning is omitted or garbled.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "overall_comment": "The provided \"translation\" is not a coherent Spanish version of the original French podcast script. It mixes multiple languages, includes meta‑comments, code snippets, and unrelated vocabulary tables. Only a tiny fragment at the very end resembles a proper closing sentence. Overall, the translation fails on readability, fluency, terminology handling, contextual fidelity, and completeness, resulting in a very low quality output.\n\n**Score Summary**\n- Readability: 2/20\n- Fluency: 2/20\n- Terminology: 3/20\n- Contextual Adaptation: 3/20\n- Information Completeness: 2/20\n- **Overall Rating:** 2/20"
