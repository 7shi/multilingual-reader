  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The sentence is short, clear and easily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners. The structure follows a simple subject‑verb‑object order and the message is conveyed without ambiguity.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The phrasing \"Gracias por habernos escuchado, ¡hasta pronto para el próximo episodio de 'Tech Éclair'!\" is natural and smooth. A native speaker might also say \"¡Hasta pronto, nos vemos en el próximo episodio de 'Tech Éclair'!\", but the provided version is perfectly idiomatic.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is minimal. The proper noun \"Tech Éclair\" is kept unchanged, which is appropriate for a brand name. The translation of \"merci de nous avoir écoutés\" into \"Gracias por habernos escuchado\" is accurate.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original French uses a friendly yet slightly formal register. The Spanish version preserves this tone, using a courteous thank‑you and a friendly farewell. Slightly more colloquial alternatives exist, but the current choice respects the podcast’s professional yet approachable style.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the source—gratitude, invitation to return, reference to the next episode, and the podcast name—are present. No important element is omitted, and there is no unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the original meaning accurately, reads naturally, and respects the intended tone of a tech‑focused podcast. Minor stylistic tweaks could make it sound a touch more colloquial, but the current version is fully appropriate for the target audience.\n\nOverall score (average): 19.2/20."
