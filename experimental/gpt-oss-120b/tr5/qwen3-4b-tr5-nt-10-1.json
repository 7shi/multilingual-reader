  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is cluttered with bracketed meta‑comments (e.g., \"1. **Vocabulario y expresiones clave**\") that are not part of the original dialogue. These interrupt the flow and make it hard for a Spanish‑speaking listener to follow the conversation. Some sentences are also oddly phrased (“para la tarea a accomplir”, “las conocencias”), which further reduces clarity.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are numerous unnatural constructions, loan‑words left in French (e.g., \"del bachotage\", \"ventana de contexto\" is okay but \"del bachotage\" is not Spanish), gender/agreement errors (\"las conocencias\"), and occasional literal translations that sound awkward. A native speaker would find the prose stilted.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"ICL (Aprendizaje en contexto)\" are correctly rendered. However, consistency suffers (sometimes \"afinamiento\" is left as \"afinado\", \"grounding\" is rendered as \"anclaje\" without explanation) and some terms are mistranslated (\"conocencias\").",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains many French expressions and even French‑style punctuation, which does not fully adapt to a Spanish‑speaking audience. The added analytical notes are inappropriate for a podcast script, and cultural references are not adjusted.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the main ideas from the original are present, but the extra meta‑comments add noise and some minor details are lost or distorted (e.g., \"del bachotage\" is a literal French term left untranslated). The core content is intact but not as concise as the source.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the general message of the podcast, but its quality is compromised by the inclusion of editorial annotations, numerous lexical and grammatical errors, and a lack of natural Spanish style. To be suitable for a Spanish‑language audience, the meta‑comments should be removed, awkward phrasing corrected, and French loan‑words replaced with proper Spanish equivalents. Technical terms are mostly correct, but consistency and clarity need improvement.\nOverall score (out of 100): 45/100.\nRecommended actions: clean the script of the analytical brackets, revise inaccurate word choices, and smooth the sentences for native fluency.\n\n**Scores:** readability 8/20, fluency 7/20, terminology 10/20, contextual adaptation 8/20, information completeness 12/20."
