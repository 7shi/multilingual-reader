  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas are easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured, and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are presented in an understandable way. Minor issues such as missing accent on \"Internet\" and occasional long sentences slightly reduce fluidity, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several expressions are literal translations that a native speaker would phrase differently (e.g., \"el afinamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\", \"enraizamiento\" for \"grounding\", \"memorísticamente\"). Some regional word choices (\"vuestras discusiones\") may feel odd in certain varieties of Spanish. Overall the text is smooth, yet the occasional awkward phrasing prevents a perfect score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" are correctly rendered and kept consistent. The term \"grounding\" is translated as \"enraizamiento\"/\"ancoraje\", which is understandable though \"anclaje\" would be more idiomatic. Consistency is maintained throughout, and the necessary explanations are preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast tone, keeps the original brand name (Tech Éclair) at the end, and adapts cultural references appropriately. The opening \"Tech Flash\" is a reasonable adaptation of the French title. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., retaining French quotation marks) do not affect the overall intent. The adaptation is effective, with only small room for improvement in localization of some terms.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and the flow of the conversation is retained. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy and keeps the content concise while maintaining the full meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. Readability and completeness are strong points, while fluency and some lexical choices could be refined for a more native feel. Technical terminology is largely accurate and consistent. With minor adjustments to idiomatic phrasing, the translation would reach an excellent level of quality.\n\nFinal total (out of 100): 86/100."
