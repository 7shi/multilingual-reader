  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can understand. Minor punctuation errors (e.g., missing closing question mark) and a small typo (\"IAL\" instead of \"ICL\") slightly affect smooth reading but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most of the script. Vocabulary is appropriate and the tone matches a podcast conversation. A few awkward phrasings (\"realidad de la IAL\", repetition of \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\" after the abbreviation) and missing accents reduce fluency slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\", etc. Consistency is good throughout. The only notable mistake is the wrong abbreviation \"IAL\" instead of \"ICL\", which could confuse readers familiar with the literature.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, style, and cultural references. It adapts the podcast format naturally to Spanish‑speaking listeners, using suitable equivalents like \"consultor\" for \"consultant\". Minor issues do not affect the overall adaptation.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the examples (English‑to‑French transfer, consultant analogy, memory feature) are fully retained. The only loss is the small typo in the abbreviation, which does not remove any factual content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical discussion clearly and maintains the conversational tone of the podcast. Minor punctuation slips, a typo in the abbreviation, and a few slightly stiff phrases keep it from being perfect, but the text is fully understandable and faithful to the source.\n\nStrengths: accurate terminology, faithful content, good readability, appropriate cultural adaptation. \nWeaknesses: occasional punctuation/typo errors, one incorrect abbreviation, a couple of mildly awkward expressions.\n\nThe translation would be ready for publication after a brief proofreading pass to fix the noted minor issues.\n\nOverall score (sum of the five criteria): 88/100."
