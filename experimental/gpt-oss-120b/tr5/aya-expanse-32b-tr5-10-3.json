  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. Sentence structures are logical, but the use of the French word \"bachotage\" (untranslated) may confuse readers who are not familiar with it. Aside from that occasional long sentence, the content is comprehensible for the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places and uses appropriate vocabulary. A few constructions feel slightly awkward (e.g., \"Piense en esto\", \"ventana de contexto\" repeated, \"bachotage\" left in French). Nevertheless, a native speaker would understand it without difficulty.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ICL\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"anclaje\" are correctly rendered and consistently used. The only minor lapse is the retention of the French slang \"bachotage\" instead of a Spanish equivalent like \"estudiar a lo loco\".",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapted the podcast title to \"Tech Relámpago\" while preserving the original French name at the closing, which respects both branding and cultural relevance. The overall tone and purpose are maintained, and the examples are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present; no ideas are omitted or incorrectly added. The only slight loss of nuance is the untranslated \"bachotage\", but it does not affect the factual content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the original podcast script accurately. It reads clearly, uses suitable technical language, and adapts well to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor issues – chiefly the leftover French term \"bachotage\" and a few slightly stiff phrasing choices – prevent it from being perfect, but overall it is a high‑quality translation suitable for publication.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
