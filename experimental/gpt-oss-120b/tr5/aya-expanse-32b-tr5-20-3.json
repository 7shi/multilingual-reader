  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original. Most sentences are easy to understand, and complex concepts are explained with appropriate examples. However, a notable typo (\"ACD\" instead of \"ICL\") and a few redundant phrasings slightly disrupt comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and the sentences are smooth, with only minor awkwardness (e.g., \"El pre‑entrenamiento.\" as an isolated fragment and some repetitive wording). Overall, it sounds fluent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly rendered and used consistently. The error where \"ICL\" becomes \"ACD\" is a significant slip, and the term \"anclaje\" for \"grounding\" is acceptable but could have been clarified.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and adapts cultural references well (e.g., \"Tecnología Relámpago\"). The use of French words \"*bachoter*\" and \"*maîtriser*\" left in Spanish may confuse some readers, and the typo mentioned above affects the perceived precision.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present, including examples and analogies. The only loss is the mistaken acronym \"ACD\" which could mislead readers about the concept of In‑Context Learning.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is strong and conveys the technical content effectively. It is readable, mostly fluent, and retains the pedagogical tone of the original podcast. The main issues are a typographical error that changes an important acronym (ICL → ACD) and a few leftover French terms that could be localized. Fixing these would raise the quality to an excellent level.\n\nTotal score (out of 100): 78/100.\n\nRecommendations: correct the acronym, replace the French loanwords with Spanish equivalents (e.g., \"copiar\" or \"estudiar a conciencia\" for \"bachoter\"), and tighten a couple of redundant sentences for smoother flow."
