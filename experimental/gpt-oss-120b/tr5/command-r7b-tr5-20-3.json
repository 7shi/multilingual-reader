  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is riddled with typographical errors, misplaced speakers (e.g., \"Luc: Lucas:\"), mixed‑language fragments, and odd insertions such as meta‑instructions that do not belong to the dialogue. These disrupt the flow and force the reader to pause to decipher who is speaking and what the intended meaning is. While the main ideas about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are recognizable, the numerous grammatical slips (\"conocimientos temporarias\", \"¡Olvida todo!\", \"¡Tech Linterna\") make the passage hard to follow for a native Spanish reader.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural constructions and lexical choices that do not sound like native Spanish. Examples include \"ancoraje\" instead of the more common \"anclaje\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" (acceptable but often rendered as \"aprendizaje por transferencia\"), and the literal rendering of English‑style prompts (\"una antisèche\"). There are also missing accent marks, duplicated words, and abrupt code‑switches back to French. Overall the text feels mechanical and occasionally incomprehensible.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally identified (preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, ICL), but their usage is inconsistent. \"Ajuste\" is used interchangeably with \"ajuste fino\", and sometimes the term is omitted entirely. The translation also adds unnecessary explanatory parentheticals that were not in the original (e.g., \"Traducción: Luc explica...\"), which dilute the technical precision. Nevertheless, the core terminology is recognizable, so the score is moderate.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to adapt several cultural and contextual elements. The podcast name is changed from \"Tech Éclair\" to \"¡Tech Linterna\", breaking the brand identity. French interjections and meta‑commentary are left in the Spanish version, confusing the target audience. Moreover, the added sections about analysing text (\"Primero, analizaré el texto...\") are irrelevant to the original script. These issues indicate poor contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original dialogue’s content is present, but many sentences are truncated, altered, or supplemented with extraneous material (e.g., the French sentence kept in the middle, the meta‑instruction about analysing text). Some analogies lose their impact due to awkward phrasing. Important nuances—such as the distinction between temporary knowledge and permanent skill—are still conveyed, but the added noise and occasional omissions lower the overall completeness.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation attempts to stay faithful to the original French script but falls short on several fronts. Frequent typographical mistakes, inconsistent terminology, and the presence of irrelevant or mixed‑language fragments make the text hard to read and understand for a native Spanish audience. While the main technical concepts are recognizable, the poor fluency, inadequate cultural adaptation, and occasional loss or distortion of information prevent the translation from being reliable or professional. A thorough revision—removing foreign insertions, correcting grammar, standardising terminology, and preserving the original podcast name—would be necessary to bring the translation up to a usable standard."
