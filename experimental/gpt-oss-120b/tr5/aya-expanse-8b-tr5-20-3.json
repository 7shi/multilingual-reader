  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original logical flow. However, there are occasional missing subjects, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent use of quotation marks that can momentarily hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds fairly natural, but several expressions are literal translations that feel stiff (e.g., \"ancraje\" instead of \"anclaje\", \"pré‑entrenamiento\" left with French accent, duplicated sentences). These reduce the overall smoothness for native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinación\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"ICL\" are correctly rendered. Minor issues appear with the inconsistent spelling of \"pre‑entrenamiento\" and the mistranslation of \"grounding\" as \"ancraje\".",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and educational tone are preserved, and cultural references are appropriate. The change of the podcast name to \"Tech Luz\" and occasional French remnants slightly affect the adaptation, but the overall message remains clear.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original dialogue are present, including the distinctions between fine‑tuning and in‑context learning, the notion of temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of memory features. No significant information is lost.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core concepts accurately and is largely readable, but it suffers from a few lexical slips, inconsistent terminology, and occasional unnatural phrasing. With minor polishing—especially correcting \"ancraje\", standardizing \"preentrenamiento\" and smoothing duplicated sentences—the text would reach a higher level of fluency and readability.\nOverall quality: good, with room for improvement in naturalness and consistency.\nTotal score (out of 100): 77/100.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 16, Fluency 14, Terminology 15, Contextual Adaptation 14, Information Completeness 18.\n\nRecommendations: \n1. Replace \"ancraje\" with \"anclaje\". \n2. Uniformly use \"preentrenamiento\" (without accent). \n3. Remove duplicated explanatory sentences. \n4. Keep the podcast name consistent (either keep \"Tech Éclair\" or translate fully)."
