  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall understandable and follows the original dialogue structure. Most sentences are clear, and the main ideas are conveyed. However, there are occasional awkward phrasings such as “La fase de calentamiento”, “las informaciones” and mismatched quotation marks that slightly disrupt the flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several lexical choices betray non‑native usage: “brilhante” (Portuguese spelling), “informaciones” (should be singular “información”), the literal borrowing “bachotage”, and occasional missing accent marks. These issues make parts of the text feel stilted.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are not always handled consistently. “Pre‑entraînement” is rendered as “fase de calentamiento”, which is not the standard term “preentrenamiento”. “Fine‑tuning” becomes simply “ajuste”, losing the nuance of “ajuste fino”. The French word “bachotage” is left untranslated, which is confusing for Spanish speakers. Overall, terminology accuracy needs improvement.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural references are minimal, and the speaker roles remain clear. Minor issues (e.g., using “ustedes” in a conversation that feels informal) do not substantially affect comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present; no major content is omitted. Minor typographic errors (extra quotation marks, mismatched exclamation) do not remove information, and the overall message stays intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the original content and maintains the conversational style of the podcast. Nevertheless, it suffers from several terminology inaccuracies and a few non‑native language slips that affect fluency. Addressing the mistranslated technical terms (especially ‘pre‑entraînement’, ‘fine‑tuning’, and ‘bachotage’) and polishing the wording would raise the quality significantly."
