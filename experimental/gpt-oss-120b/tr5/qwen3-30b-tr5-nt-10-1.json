  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "I cannot assess readability because the original French passage and its Spanish translation were not provided. Without seeing the actual text I cannot judge whether the target‑language readers can easily understand the content, whether complex ideas are explained clearly, or whether the sentence flow is logical.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Fluency and naturalness can only be judged by examining the Spanish rendering. Since the translation is missing, I cannot evaluate the smoothness of the language, the appropriateness of vocabulary, or any awkward constructions.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Evaluating technical terminology requires seeing which terms were used and how they were handled. In the absence of the source and target texts, I cannot determine if specialized vocabulary was translated appropriately or consistently.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Without the French source and its Spanish counterpart, I cannot verify whether the translator preserved the original intent, adapted cultural references, or optimized expressions for the target audience.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Information completeness depends on a side‑by‑side comparison to see if any content was omitted, added, or redundantly repeated. Since no text is available, this criterion cannot be evaluated.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "To provide a meaningful evaluation I need the original French excerpt and its Spanish translation. Please supply both texts (or at least the sections you want assessed), and I will score each criterion out of 20 points with detailed reasoning as requested."
