Please provide the texts to receive a proper assessment of the translation quality across all criteria listed.\n\nIf you supply the two versions, a detailed scoring and reasoning for each of the five criteria (readability, fluency, terminology, contextual adaptation, information completeness) will be generated, together with an overall comment and an aggregate score out of 100 points (average of the five 20‑point criteria)."
