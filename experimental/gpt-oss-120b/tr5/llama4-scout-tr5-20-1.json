  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure, allowing readers to grasp the concepts. However, there are occasional clunky constructions and retained English punctuation/quotes that disrupt flow, making some sentences feel less natural.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural phrases (e.g., “Imaginad que enviamos…”, “Ella lo olvida todo.”) and retains English markers like “Luc:” and quotation marks that would not appear in a native‑speaker script. Vocabulary is mostly correct but the overall rhythm is uneven.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly translated correctly (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL). Nevertheless, some terms remain in English or are inconsistently formatted (e.g., “fine‑tuning” in parentheses, “grounding” kept in English), which reduces consistency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast’s informative and conversational tone and adapts greetings to Spanish culture (“Hola y bienvenidos”). Small issues such as literal translations of French‑style interjections (“Exactamente.”) slightly affect naturalness, but the intent is well conveyed.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory tricks, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. No substantive content is omitted, and the logical progression is retained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content and the podcast’s explanatory style, but it suffers from occasional awkward phrasing, unnecessary retention of English markers, and inconsistent handling of some technical terms. A smoother, fully localized version would improve readability and fluency, while standardising terminology would enhance clarity for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Overall, it is a competent translation that could be refined for native‑speaker polish."
