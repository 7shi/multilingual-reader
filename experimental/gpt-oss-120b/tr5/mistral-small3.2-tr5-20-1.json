  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas and the technical concepts are explained in plain language. A few minor hiccups (e.g., the isolated \"El preentrenamiento. Es un proceso\" and the use of the plural \"informaciones\" instead of the more natural singular \"información\") slightly disrupt the flow, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part and uses appropriate colloquial register for a podcast. Some constructions feel literal (“Es aquí donde entra en juego el concepto de anclaje…”, “El aprendizaje en contexto es como empollar”) and a couple of phrases are a bit awkward, but overall a native speaker would understand without effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento (ajuste fino)\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\" for grounding, etc. The terminology is consistent throughout the text and matches the expected Spanish usage in AI literature.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish well (greeting \"¡Hola y bienvenidos!\", use of \"usted\"/\"tú\" alternation appropriate for a conversational style). Cultural references are preserved, and the content is presented in a way that feels natural to Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the logical order of the dialogue is maintained. The only minor issue is the slightly truncated line about \"pre‑entraînement\", but it does not cause loss of meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and keeps the informal, educational podcast vibe. Minor stylistic and grammatical tweaks (especially smoothing out isolated fragments and preferring singular \"información\") would raise the fluency and readability scores, but the work is already very solid and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
