  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is difficult to follow because it mixes the dialogue with extensive meta‑annotations (vocab lists, intent notes, etc.). The reader has to separate the actual conversation from the explanatory blocks, which interrupts flow. Some sentences are long or awkwardly phrased in Spanish, making comprehension harder.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many passages are literal translations from French that sound unnatural in Spanish (e.g., \"Exactement !\" left unchanged, \"las nuevas conocimientos\" instead of \"los nuevos conocimientos\"). There are also grammatical slips, gender‑agreement errors and occasional English words. Overall the Spanish does not read smoothly as a native‑speaker would expect.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, transferencia de aprendizaje, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding) are generally preserved and correctly rendered. However, some terms are inconsistently translated or left in French/English, and a few explanations are either missing or overly literal. The handling is adequate but not flawless.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent – a clear, engaging podcast explanation – is obscured by the inserted instructional notes, which would never appear in a spoken podcast. Cultural references are untouched, and the tone shifts between formal meta‑commentary and informal dialogue, weakening the adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the main ideas of the original script are present, and no crucial technical point is omitted. The extra meta‑information is redundant rather than missing, so the core content is complete, though the added material makes the text longer than necessary.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the overall structure and most of the technical content of the original French podcast, but it is marred by the inclusion of unnecessary meta‑annotations, numerous lexical and grammatical inaccuracies, and a lack of natural flow in Spanish. To be suitable for the intended audience, the text should be cleaned of the explanatory blocks, corrected for gender and agreement errors, and rewritten in a more idiomatic, conversational style.\n\nScore Summary:\n- Readability: 8/20\n- Fluency: 6/20\n- Terminology: 12/20\n- Contextual Adaptation: 9/20\n- Information Completeness: 13/20"
