  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the logical flow of the original. Most sentences convey the intended meaning, and complex concepts are explained clearly. Minor issues such as stray labels (e.g., \"Translation:\"), occasional literal phrasing, and a few awkward constructions slightly affect smooth reading.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several moments where the wording is literal or clunky (e.g., \"a un nuevo IA\", \"Está bien/De acuerdo.\", inconsistent use of the acronym AIC, and the unnecessary English word \"prompt\"). These reduce the native‑speaker feel, though the overall text remains comprehensible.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly rendered and consistent. The occasional retention of English words like \"prompt\" is acceptable in a technical context but could have been localized. Overall term handling is solid.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural references (consultor brillante, chuleta) are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor inconsistencies (mixing formal and colloquial registers) slightly affect cohesion, but the message remains clear.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. Only negligible artefacts (the stray \"Translation:\" label) are missing, so completeness is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a good job of conveying the technical discussion in a clear and mostly natural Spanish. While readability and terminology are strong, fluency suffers from occasional literal phrasing and inconsistent handling of some English terms. Minor stylistic tweaks would bring the text to a higher level of polish, but the essential information and pedagogical tone are well preserved.\nOverall score: 82/100."
