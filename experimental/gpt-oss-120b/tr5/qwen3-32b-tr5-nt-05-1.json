  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the concepts are explained in a way that a native reader can follow. Sentence structures are logical, but there is an occasional mix of formal and informal pronouns (\"usted\" vs \"tú\") and some very long sentences that could be split for easier reading.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part and uses appropriate vocabulary. A few expressions feel slightly awkward or overly literal (e.g., \"Miren ustedes\", \"una nueva ventana de discusión\", spacing around «olvidado»). The register fluctuates, which slightly reduces the fluidity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are correctly rendered and consistently used. The English acronyms are retained with proper explanations, which is ideal for the target audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., using \"consultor\" instead of \"consultant\"). Minor issues stem from the mixed formal/informal tone, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and details from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted or added unnecessarily.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, uses appropriate terminology, and retains the original message. Minor improvements could be made in consistency of register and smoothing a few literal phrases, which would raise readability and fluency scores further. The translation is complete and well‑adapted for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 90"
