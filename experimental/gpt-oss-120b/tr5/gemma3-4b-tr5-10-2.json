  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are mostly short and logical, and complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained clearly. Minor hiccups do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "A few expressions sound unnatural to a native speaker: “se ataque a la mecánica cuántica”, “Puede tomar un modelo…”, and the calque “bachotaje”. The rest flows well, but these awkward spots lower the naturalness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, prompt). The translation keeps the English‑origin words where appropriate and provides Spanish equivalents consistently. Slight issue with “enraizamiento” for grounding, but it is understandable.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts the dialogue to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the explanatory tone is maintained. Small remnants of French phrasing remain, but they do not affect the message.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, la diferencia entre memoria temporal y permanente, y la explicación de la función de “Memoria”. No relevant information is lost.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion effectively. Readability and completeness are high, and terminology is handled well. Fluency suffers from a few non‑native constructions, and a couple of terms could be rendered more idiomatically. With minor polishing, the text would read like a natural Spanish podcast script.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 18, Fluency 15, Terminology 17, Contextual adaptation 16, Information completeness 19. The average yields an overall score of 17/20."
