  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are clear. The sentences are sometimes long, but a native reader can follow them without difficulty. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., \"las conocimientos\") do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are several awkward expressions: \"las nuevas informaciones\", \"las conocimientos\", and the retention of the French word \"antisèche\". These choices feel un‑Spanish and create a slight stilted feeling, though they do not break understanding.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is well‑handled. Key terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and the acronym \"ICL\" are correctly rendered. The decision to keep \"prompt\" in English is acceptable in a tech‑savvy context. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only noticeable lapse is the unchanged French slang \"antisèche\", which could have been adapted to a Spanish equivalent (e.g., \"chuleta\"). Otherwise the adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and nuances from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is omitted, and the structure mirrors the original script. Minor typographical errors do not affect the completeness of the conveyed content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is generally high‑quality: it conveys the technical concepts accurately and keeps the conversational style of the podcast. Readability and terminology are strong points. Fluency suffers from a few un‑natural phrases and the occasional untranslated French term, which prevent a perfect native feel. With minor edits to smooth the language and fully localise slang, the text would be excellent.\n\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 81/100.\n\n**Strengths**: clear explanation of complex AI concepts, consistent use of technical terms, faithful transmission of content.\n**Areas for improvement**: polish grammatical gender agreement, replace French colloquialisms with Spanish equivalents, and refine a handful of awkward expressions.\n\n**Final rating**: 81/100."
