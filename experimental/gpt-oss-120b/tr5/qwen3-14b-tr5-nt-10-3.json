    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and conveys the ideas of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning clearly. The structure of the dialogue mirrors the original and the concepts are explained with simple analogies. Minor issues that slightly hurt readability are the retention of the French word “antisèche” (no Spanish equivalent is given) and occasional gender mismatches (e.g., “las conocimientos”). These do not block understanding but require the reader to pause.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly naturally, but there are several awkward phrasings and grammatical slips: “La diferencia entre estudiar de forma superficial para un examen y realmente dominar un tema?” (syntactically odd), repeated gender errors (\"las conocimientos\"), and occasional literal constructions such as “una antisèche”. These issues make the text feel slightly stilted for a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well. The translator kept the established Spanish equivalents for most AI‑related vocabulary: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “ICL”, “anclaje”. The occasional English/French term left in parentheses (e.g., “grounding”) is acceptable in a technical podcast context. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience is largely successful. The introductory greeting and informal podcast tone are appropriate. Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is needed. The only lapse is the use of the French word “antisèche”, which could have been replaced by a Spanish colloquialism (e.g., “chuleta” or “apunte”). Otherwise the intent and style of the original are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the concept of temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No substantive content is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary material.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the technical content accurately and keeps the conversational flow of the podcast. It scores well on terminology and completeness, but fluency and readability are lowered by a few grammatical errors and the retention of a French term. With minor edits to gender agreement and replacement of “antisèche” by a Spanish equivalent, the text would be close to native‑level quality.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16.8 ≈ 17/20.\n\n**Final rating:** 17/20."
