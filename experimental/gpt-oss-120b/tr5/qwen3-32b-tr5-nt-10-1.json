  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained clearly. Minor punctuation quirks do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads mostly naturally, but a few passages feel literal (“memoria a corto plazo”, “es como contratar a un consultor brillante”). Slightly awkward phrasing and occasional over‑translation prevent a perfect native feel.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled expertly. Core terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ICL* and *grounding* are retained or explained appropriately. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the target audience’s cultural context and keeps the original intent. A few expressions could be smoother for a Spanish‑speaking listener (e.g., “memoria a corto plazo” could be phrased as “ventana de contexto ampliada”), but overall the adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present. No relevant detail is omitted, and the examples (consultant vs. expert, memory tricks) are fully retained.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality: it conveys the technical content accurately and remains comprehensible for Spanish listeners. Minor fluency and stylistic tweaks would bring it closer to a native‑speaker level, but the core message and terminology are preserved excellently.\nOverall score (out of 100): 89/100."
