  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but several grammatical slips (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en”, “Usted ha entendido todo”, “las conocencias”) and awkward constructions hinder smooth comprehension. The core ideas are present, yet the reader must pause to parse some sentences.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many non‑native expressions and lexical errors such as “el aprendizaje en contexto es el apretar” (incorrect translation of “cramming”) and inconsistent use of formal / informal pronouns. The flow feels stilted compared with natural Spanish podcast dialogue.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms like “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto” and “ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)” are correctly kept. However, some terms are mistranslated or oddly rendered (e.g., “apretar” for cramming, “conocencias” instead of “conocimientos”, “anclaje (sostén)”). Consistency is mostly good but not perfect.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The tone of a podcast is preserved, but cultural and linguistic adaptations are uneven. Phrases like “Hola y bienvenido en” are unnatural, and there’s a mix of “Usted” and “tú”. Minor mismatches reduce the sense of natural adaptation for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French script are conveyed: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the notion of temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the “memory” feature trick. The only loss is the nuance of the “cramming” metaphor, which is incorrectly rendered, and a few lexical slips that could cause slight confusion.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the full structure and technical content of the original podcast, but it suffers from several linguistic inaccuracies and awkward phrasing that affect readability and naturalness. Technical terminology is mostly handled well, yet a few key terms are mistranslated, and the mix of formal and informal pronouns creates inconsistency. With careful proofreading and adjustment of problematic words (e.g., replacing “apretar” with “bachotaje”, fixing “conocencias”, and smoothing introductory phrases), the translation could reach a much higher quality level.\nOverall rating: 12/20, indicating a fair but noticeably improvable translation.\n\n**Strengths**: complete coverage of ideas, correct handling of most technical terms, preservation of podcast style.\n**Weaknesses**: grammatical errors, unnatural expressions, occasional mistranslation of key concepts, inconsistent register.\n**Recommendation**: revise the highlighted errors and harmonize the register to achieve a smoother, more native‑like Spanish version.\n\n**Final score (average of criteria)**: 12/20."
