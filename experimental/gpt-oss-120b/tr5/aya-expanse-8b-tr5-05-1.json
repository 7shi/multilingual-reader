  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are conveyed clearly. Most sentences are understandable, and the logical flow of the podcast dialogue is preserved. Minor issues such as duplicated speaker labels (e.g., \"Camille: \\\"Camille:\\\"\"), occasional stray quotation marks and the retention of the French term «pré‑entrenamiento» slightly hinder smooth reading, but they do not obstruct comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward constructions and inconsistent punctuation. Examples include the mixing of French terms with Spanish (\"pré‑entrenamiento\"), the literal rendering of \"ancrage\" and the occasional literal translation of English‑style expressions (\"aprendizaje contextualizado\" instead of a more idiomatic \"aprendizaje en contexto\"). These quirks make the text feel slightly stilted for a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled inconsistently. While key concepts like \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are correctly rendered, other terms remain in the original language (e.g., \"fine‑tuning\", \"window of context\", \"ancrage\"). This can confuse readers unfamiliar with the mixed vocabulary and reduces terminological coherence.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast’s tone and intent, adapting the title to \"Tech Relámpago\" appropriately. Cultural references are neutral, so no major mis‑adaptations occur. The few retained French terms are the main deviations, but overall the adaptation conveys the same message to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the dialogue structure is retained. Small redundancies (duplicate speaker tags) and minor lexical leftovers do not affect the completeness of the information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the original podcast’s content and educational tone. Readability and completeness are strong, but fluency and terminology suffer from occasional literal borrowings and inconsistent handling of technical terms. A careful edit to replace remaining French/English terms with their Spanish equivalents and to smooth out punctuation would raise the overall quality significantly.\nOverall score: 79/100."
