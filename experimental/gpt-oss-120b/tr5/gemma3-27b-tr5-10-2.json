    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the complex ideas about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained clearly. A few long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but overall a Spanish‑speaking audience can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, using idiomatic Spanish (e.g., \"como enviar a este graduado a hacer una especialización\"). Some minor awkwardness remains: the phrase \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje\" is clunky, and the English word *prompt* is left untranslated (acceptable but could be rendered as \"entrada\" or \"solicitud\"). Overall the flow is good but not perfectly native.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\" and \"grounding (anclaje)\" are all rendered correctly. The occasional retention of English words (prompt, fine‑tuning) is standard in the field and does not cause confusion.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French tone to a Spanish‑speaking podcast format well. Cultural references are neutral and appropriate. The only drawback is the insertion of extra options for \"¿A qué te refieres? / ¿Qué quieres decir? / ¿O sea?\" which are not present in the source and add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original script is retained. No significant details are omitted, and the added clarifications (e.g., the list of possible translations for \"¿A qué te refieres?\") do not alter the meaning. The content remains complete and faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical concepts accurately, uses appropriate terminology, and remains readable for a Spanish audience. Minor fluency issues and a small amount of redundant phrasing prevent a perfect score, but overall it is an effective and faithful rendering of the original French podcast script.\nOverall Score: 18/20"
