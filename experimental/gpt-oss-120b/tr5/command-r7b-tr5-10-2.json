    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the dialogue structure is preserved. Most sentences are clear, and the technical concepts are explained similarly to the original. However, the translation of «pré‑entraînement» as “La fase de calentamiento” is confusing and non‑standard, which may interrupt comprehension for some readers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward expressions: “La fase de calentamiento”, “El ajuste” (instead of “ajuste fino”), the Portuguese‑style spelling “brilhante”, the retained French word “bachotage”, and minor punctuation issues (missing closing quotes). These hiccups prevent the text from flowing as smoothly as native‑speaker Spanish would.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: «pre‑entrenamiento», «ajuste», «aprendizaje por transferencia», «ventana de contexto», «ICL», «anclaje», «memoria». The only slight inconsistency is the use of “ajuste” without the qualifier “fino”, which could be ambiguous for readers less familiar with machine‑learning jargon.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish well and respects the informal conversational style. Nevertheless, a few cultural‑linguistic slips (e.g., retaining French/Portuguese terms, the literal “fase de calentamiento”) reduce the adaptation quality. Overall the intent and purpose are preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present. No major ideas are omitted, and the logical progression of the discussion is intact. Minor lexical choices do not lead to loss of meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and maintains the podcast’s educational tone. It is readable and complete, but several lexical and stylistic inaccuracies (especially the odd rendering of «pré‑entraînement», the occasional Portuguese spelling, and the retained French term “bachotage”) affect fluency and naturalness. A careful edit to replace these with standard Spanish equivalents would raise the overall quality significantly.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 84/100."
