  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and the logical flow of the dialogue is preserved. The concepts are explained clearly and the sentence structures are mostly simple. A few French remnants (e.g., “Parce que”) slightly interrupt the flow, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several literal constructions and uncommon word choices (“afianzamiento” for fine‑tuning, “ancrado” for grounding) that a native speaker would rarely use. Some sentences feel a bit stiff or contain mixed language, reducing overall smoothness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely retained, but the translation opts for less standard equivalents (e.g., “afianzamiento” instead of the widely used “ajuste fino”). The term “grounding” is rendered as “ancrado”, which may be unfamiliar. Consistency is decent, yet the terminology could be more precise for a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent, tone, and educational purpose of the original podcast are well conveyed. Cultural references are appropriate for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor lapses such as the leftover French phrase and occasional literal translations slightly weaken the adaptation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the original information is present; no major ideas are omitted or altered. The translation keeps the full dialogue and examples, providing a faithful rendering of the source content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and complete, preserving the educational narrative of the podcast. Readability and completeness are strong points. Fluency and terminology suffer from a few literal choices and non‑standard technical vocabularies, which make the text feel slightly less natural for native speakers. Minor French leftovers indicate a need for careful proofreading, but the core message is well delivered.\n\n**Overall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20**"
