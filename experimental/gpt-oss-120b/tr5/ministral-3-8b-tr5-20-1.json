  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure, but several sentences are awkward or contain errors that hinder smooth comprehension (e.g., \"Ce sería incroyablement inefficace\", \"El preentrenamiento es un tema que percibimos como fundamental...\", \"Miren:\" instead of a more natural cue). These issues force the reader to pause and re‑interpret, lowering overall readability.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but the mixture of French/Spanish in one sentence, the incorrect \"Ce sería\", and occasional literal renderings (e.g., \"Miren:\") make the prose feel stilted. Vocabulary is appropriate, yet the flow is interrupted by these glitches.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje, prompt, etc. The terminology is consistent and suitable for the target audience, with only minor style variations.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and adapts most expressions to Spanish cultural context. However, the stray French phrase and the added explanatory sentence about preentrenamiento slightly diverge from the original tone, preventing a perfect adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key ideas, examples, and analogies from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No major content is omitted, and the supplemental explanations do not distort the meaning. Minor wording differences do not affect factual completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content and keeping the conversational style of the podcast. Strengths lie in accurate terminology and faithful conveyance of information. The main weaknesses are occasional language mixing and awkward phrasing that affect readability and fluency. A careful proofread to eliminate the French‑Spanish hybrid sentence and smooth out literal constructions would raise the quality substantially."
