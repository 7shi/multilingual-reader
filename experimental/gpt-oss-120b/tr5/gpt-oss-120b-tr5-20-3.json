  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are easy to follow. Sentences are generally clear, and complex concepts such as transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can grasp. Minor hiccups (e.g., occasional long sentences) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. A few expressions feel slightly awkward – for example, \"hablarles\" instead of \"hablarle\" and the phrasing \"una chuleta justo antes de que empiece a hablarles\" – but they do not break the flow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, anclaje (grounding). The occasional retention of the English acronym ICL is acceptable, and no key term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using familiar analogies and idiomatic language. Cultural references are neutral, preserving the original intent. Some sentences could be slightly more concise, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is preserved. No details are omitted, and the logical sequence of the discussion remains intact. The translation does not introduce unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality: it conveys the original podcast’s educational tone, keeps the technical explanations accurate, and remains accessible to Spanish listeners. Minor stylistic tweaks would make it flawless, but the current version is very solid and faithful to the source material.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18/20."
