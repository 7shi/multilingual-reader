  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is riddled with incoherent speaker tags, sudden language switches (French and English fragments remain), and typographical errors (e.g., “Lucas: Exactamente”, “Cami: ¡Olvida todo!”, “conocimientos temporarias”). These break the flow and make it hard for a reader to follow the conversation. Sentences are often fragmented or duplicated, which forces the reader to re‑read to grasp the meaning. Consequently, the overall comprehensibility is very low.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many expressions sound unnatural or outright incorrect (“¡Olvídate de todo”, “conocimientos temporarias”, “La “Memoria” que algunos modelos están incorporando no es exactamente lo mismo que el ICL”). The translation also includes unnecessary parenthetical explanations that are not present in the original, and the dialogue sometimes loses the smooth back‑and‑forth rhythm of a podcast. The result is a stilted, non‑native feel.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje en contexto* (ICL) and *memoria contextual* are correctly rendered. However, there are inconsistencies (e.g., “ajuste” vs. “ajuste fino”), occasional mistranslations (“conocimientos temporarias”), and some terms are left in French (“ancoraje”, “anchorage”) or English. The handling is partially adequate but marred by the surrounding errors.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to adapt several culturally specific or idiomatic French expressions into natural Spanish equivalents. Moreover, the inclusion of untranslated French sentences toward the end (“En fait, je m'aperçois…”) shows a lack of proper adaptation. The podcast’s informal, explanatory tone is not consistently preserved, reducing the suitability for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original dialogue’s content is present, but many sections are corrupted, duplicated, or truncated. Extra parenthetical notes that do not belong to the original script add noise, while some nuances (e.g., the distinction between “temporario” and “permanente” knowledge) are blurred. Overall, the essential information is conveyed, but with considerable loss of clarity and added irrelevant material.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation attempts to keep the structure of the original French podcast script, and it does retain the main technical concepts. Unfortunately, the execution is severely compromised by numerous linguistic errors, mixed‑language fragments, and misplaced editorial notes. Readability and fluency are low, making the text difficult for a native Spanish speaker to follow. While the key terminology is mostly correct, inconsistencies and untranslated portions undermine the quality. The translation would require a thorough rewrite to be suitable for a Spanish‑language audience.\n\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 31/100."
