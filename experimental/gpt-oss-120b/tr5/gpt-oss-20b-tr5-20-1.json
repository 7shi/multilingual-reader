  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow and the concepts are clearly expressed. Minor typographical quirks (e.g., duplicated \"Camille:\" labels, occasional stray spaces) do not hinder comprehension, but they slightly affect the flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The language is mostly natural, but a few literal renderings and punctuation oddities make some sentences feel slightly stilted (e.g., \"Camille : Hola y bienvenidos...\", \"El propio modelo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus conversaciones.\"). Overall, a native speaker would understand it without difficulty.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly translated and consistently used: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, anclaje (grounding). The occasional retention of English words (fine‑tuning) is acceptable in a technical context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts idioms to Spanish (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", \"bachotaje\"). Cultural references are neutral, and the explanatory style is maintained, with only minor awkward phrasings.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the logical progression of ideas remains intact.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the technical discussion effectively. It is readable and largely natural, with only minor issues in punctuation, formatting, and occasional literal phrasing. The terminology is well handled, and the content is complete. A small editorial pass to clean up duplicated labels and smooth out a few sentences would bring it to a near‑perfect level."
