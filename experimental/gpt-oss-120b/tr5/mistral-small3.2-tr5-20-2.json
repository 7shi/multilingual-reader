  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the technical concepts are explained, but there are several awkward or incomplete sentences (e.g., “El preentrenamiento. Es un proceso”, “informaciones específicas”). Inconsistent use of formal/informal address (tú vs. usted) also slightly hampers flow. Overall, a native reader can follow the discussion, but occasional clunkiness reduces smoothness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences are literal translations from French, resulting in unnatural phrasing (“el concepto de anclaje que consiste en vincular las respuestas de la IA a las informaciones específicas”). Register shifts and missing accents further affect naturalness. Nevertheless, the majority of the text reads fluently enough for a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento (ajuste fino)”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (In-Context Learning)”. The translation of “grounding” as “anclaje” is appropriate. No major term is omitted or mistranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural references are neutral and suitable. Minor issues such as mixing formal/informal address and overly literal phrasing prevent a perfect adaptation, but the overall message remains clear.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the content from the French source is present; no significant information is lost. Minor punctuation differences do not affect meaning. The translation is complete and faithful.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast’s educational narrative accurately and retains most of the technical depth. While the terminology is solid and the information complete, readability and fluency suffer from a few literal translations, incomplete sentences, and inconsistent register. With a light editorial pass to smooth out these issues, the text would be fully natural for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16.4/20 ≈ 16.\nOverall rating: 16/20."
