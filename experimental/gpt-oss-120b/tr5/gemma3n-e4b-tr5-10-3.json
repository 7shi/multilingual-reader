  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences are understandable, and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can follow. Minor issues such as the typo “pre‑entrerenamiento” and occasional overly long sentences slightly affect smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several fluency problems: the typo “pre‑entrerenamiento”, inconsistent use of second‑person forms (“Podéis” vs. the rest of the text that uses “tú/usted”), occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., “cuando abre una nueva ventana, empiezas…”) and the final brand name change to “Tech Flash”. These make the text feel less natural for native speakers, although the overall meaning remains intact.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “anclaje (grounding)”. The only notable mistake is the misspelling of “pre‑entrenamiento”. The translation keeps the terms consistent throughout, which aids understanding.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone well, adapting the explanations for a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, the change of the podcast name from «Tech Éclair» to «Tech Flash» is a cultural/literal deviation, and the occasional use of “vosotros” feels out of place for many Latin American listeners. Overall, the adaptation is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are retained: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the description of “memory” features. No significant content is omitted, and the translation does not add irrelevant material.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the substance of the original podcast script and presents the technical concepts in a generally understandable way. Nevertheless, typographical errors, inconsistent pronoun usage, and a few unnatural phrasing choices prevent it from feeling fully native. The change of the podcast title at the end is a minor but noticeable deviation. With a few edits to fix spelling, harmonise the second‑person form, and restore the original brand name, the translation would reach a much higher level of fluency and polish.\nOverall rating (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
