  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the dialogue format is preserved. Most sentences are clear, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can grasp. However, there are a few typographical errors (e.g., missing accent in \"Pense\", \"cramar\" which is not a Spanish word) that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural: \"cramar\" instead of a proper translation of \"cramming\", \"Pense en esto\" without accent, and the use of \"afianzamiento\" for fine‑tuning, which is uncommon. Some sentences are overly literal, leading to awkward phrasing. Despite these issues, a native speaker would understand the content without major difficulty.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly kept or correctly rendered (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, prompt). The translation of \"grounding\" as \"anclado\" is acceptable, though \"anclaje\" would be more usual. The choice of \"afianzamiento\" for fine‑tuning is less standard than \"afinamiento\", but the meaning is clear. Overall terminology handling is solid.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and maintains the podcast‑style dialogue. Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is needed. Minor issues like the incorrect word \"cramar\" and occasional literalness reduce the naturalness for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present. No major ideas are omitted, and the logical flow of the discussion is retained. The only loss is the nuance of the word \"cramming\" which becomes the nonsensical \"cramar\", but the surrounding context still communicates the intended meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a good job of preserving the structure and technical content of the original podcast script. Readability is high, and the essential information is complete. Fluency and naturalness suffer from a few lexical errors and non‑standard term choices, which prevent the text from feeling completely native. With minor proofreading and adjustment of a few terms, the translation would reach a very high quality level.\n\nOverall score (sum of the five criteria): 77/100."
