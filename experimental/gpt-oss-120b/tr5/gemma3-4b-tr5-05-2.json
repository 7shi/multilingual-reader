  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow, sentences are logically ordered and complex ideas are explained clearly. Minor issues such as the three‑option line “¿Entonces? / ¿A eso te refieres? / ¿Qué quieres decir?” and a missing accent in “Ahi” slightly disrupt flow, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural and would be understood by native speakers. A few word choices feel slightly awkward (“el afinamiento” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”, “bachoteo” is informal, and the slash‑separated alternatives for a single question). These quirks keep the text from being perfectly smooth.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “ventana de contexto”, and the grounding note are all appropriate and consistent. The only slight deviation is the use of “afinamiento” for fine‑tuning, which is understandable but less idiomatic.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are neutral and the analogies (consultant, bicycle) work equally in Spanish. Minor phrasing choices (e.g., “artimaña” for “trick”) are acceptable but could be smoother.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All relevant information from the French source is present. No major ideas are omitted, and the supplemental clarifications (e.g., explaining “bachoteo”) help the reader. The only redundancy is the multiple question variants for “C’est‑à‑dire?”, which does not affect completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains largely readable and natural, and respects the original’s educational tone. Minor lexical and stylistic hiccups prevent a perfect score, but the overall communication is clear and effective.\nOverall score: 88/100."
