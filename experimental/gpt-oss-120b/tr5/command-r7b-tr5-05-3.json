  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the main ideas and most sentences are understandable. However, occasional French words (e.g., \"Précisément\", \"ancrage\") and a few awkward constructions (\"Luc: Précisément. Y durante mucho tiempo…\") interrupt the flow and may force the reader to pause.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds semi‑natural but contains several non‑Spanish insertions, literal renderings and grammatical slips (e.g., missing Spanish equivalents for \"Précisément\", the unnecessary duplication of a line by Luc, and the use of \"ancrage\" instead of \"anclaje\"). These issues reduce the overall smoothness.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly rendered. The main weakness is the lack of translation for \"ancrage\" (grounding) and occasional inconsistency in using French terms. Otherwise the terminology is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone, adapting the podcast style to Spanish. Cultural references are preserved, and the explanation remains clear. The presence of French remnants and an extra, non‑original line by Luc slightly detracts from a fully adapted version.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of the \"Memory\" feature. No major factual information is lost, although the added line about a new learning form is redundant but not harmful.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is faithful and conveys the technical content well, but it suffers from a few noticeable flaws: French words that were not translated, occasional awkward phrasing, and a duplicated line that does not exist in the source. A careful proofreading to replace the French remnants with proper Spanish equivalents and to smooth out the sentence constructions would raise the quality to a near‑native level."
