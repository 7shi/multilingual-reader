    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the main ideas and most sentences are understandable. However, there are several lexical slips (e.g., “cramar” instead of ‘empollar’, “conversión única” instead of ‘conversación única’, “pre‑entrenación” typo) that may momentarily confuse the reader. The overall flow is decent, but the occasional awkward phrasing reduces smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains numerous unnatural expressions and grammatical oddities: “bienvenido/a en”, “Usted ha entendido todo.”, inconsistent use of formal / informal register, misplaced spaces before exclamation marks, and the odd word choice “anticipo” for ‘cheat‑sheet’. These issues make the text feel less native‑like.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved (pre‑entrenamiento, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding → anclaje). “Fine‑tuning” is rendered as “afinamiento”, which is acceptable, though “pre‑entrenación” is a typo. The erroneous “cramar” for ‘cramming’ is a clear mistake. Consistency is decent but not perfect.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally respects the original intent and keeps the podcast‑style tone. Cultural adaptation is adequate, but the lexical errors and some overly formal phrasing (“Se puede decir eso”) slightly detract from the naturalness for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the concepts, examples, and analogies from the French original are present. No major information is omitted, and the structure mirrors the source. Minor redundancy (e.g., repeated exclamation marks) does not affect completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the overall content and structure of the original podcast script, but it suffers from several lexical and grammatical inaccuracies that hinder fluency and readability. While the technical terminology is largely correct, typographical errors (pre‑entrenación) and wrong word choices (cramar, conversión) reduce the professional quality. With careful proofreading and more natural phrasing, the translation could reach a much higher level of polish."
