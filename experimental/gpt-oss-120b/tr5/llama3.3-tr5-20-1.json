  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow; sentences are logically ordered and the dialogue flows naturally. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained clearly, and the conversational style remains intact. Minor punctuation quirks (e.g., missing commas) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds largely natural to a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. A few constructions feel slightly literal (e.g., \"ventana de contexto\" instead of the more common \"ventana de contexto\" is fine, but \"consultor temporal\" could be rendered as \"consultor puntual\"), and occasional punctuation (exclamation marks) is over‑used, giving a marginally stilted feel.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje\" are all accurate. Consistency is maintained throughout, and when a term could be ambiguous (e.g., \"grounding\"), the translator kept the French loanword \"anclaje\", which is acceptable in a technical podcast context.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is needed. A few idiomatic expressions could be smoother (e.g., \"¡Exactamente!\" is fine, but \"¡Exactamente!\" repeated often feels slightly exaggerated). Overall the adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No sentences or ideas are omitted, and the logical progression of the discussion is retained. The only minor issue is a tiny typographic omission of an accent in \"¡Exactamente!\" but it does not affect meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical concepts clearly, retains the conversational style of the podcast, and includes virtually all the original information. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but overall the work is professional and faithful to the source.\n\nStrengths: clear explanation of complex AI concepts, consistent terminology, complete coverage of content.\nAreas for improvement: occasional literal phrasing and punctuation that could be smoothed for a more natural Spanish flow.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20.\n\nScore: 18"
