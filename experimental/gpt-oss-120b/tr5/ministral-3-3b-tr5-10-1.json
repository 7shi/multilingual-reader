  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the flow of ideas follows the original. Most sentences convey the concepts clearly, but there are occasional awkward constructions (e.g., “El afinado. Es como enviar…”, missing articles) that may cause a brief pause for the reader.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several literal renderings and mixed language tags (e.g., “*grounding* (anclaje)”, “ICL”) that feel unnatural to a native speaker. Some word choices such as “El afinado” for “fine‑tuning” are not idiomatic. Overall the text is readable but not fully smooth.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly kept, but a few are rendered sub‑optimally: “afinado” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”, “entrenamiento por transferencia” vs. the usual “aprendizaje por transferencia”, and the abbreviation ICL is left unexplained. Consistency could be improved.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the intent of the original discussion and adapts the examples to Spanish‑speaking listeners. However, the podcast name is inconsistent (“Tech Flash” at the start, “Tech Éclair” at the end) and some cultural nuances (e.g., the use of asterisks) are retained from the source without adaptation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present; no substantive information is omitted. Minor stylistic redundancies are kept, but the content remains complete and accurate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in transmitting the core ideas about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning. Readability and completeness are good, but fluency and terminology need refinement to sound natural to native Spanish speakers. Inconsistent naming of the podcast and occasional literal translations slightly detract from the overall polish.\nOverall score: 14/20."
