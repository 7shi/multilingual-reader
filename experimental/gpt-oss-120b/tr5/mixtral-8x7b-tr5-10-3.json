    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The sentence is short, clear and easily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners. All ideas are expressed directly without ambiguity.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The phrasing is natural; \"Gracias por habernos escuchado\" and \"¡hasta pronto para el próximo episodio de 'Tech Éclair'!\" are idiomatic. A slightly more common alternative would be \"Gracias por escucharnos\" or \"¡hasta pronto y nos vemos en el próximo episodio!\", but the current version is still smooth.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly. \"Tech Éclair\" is kept as a proper name, and \"próximo episodio\" accurately renders \"prochain épisode\". No mistranslations are present.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the friendly‑formal tone appropriate for a tech podcast. The cultural register is suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience; only a minor stylistic tweak could make it sound slightly more conversational.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All elements of the original French closing are retained: gratitude, farewell, anticipation of the next episode, and the podcast name. No information is omitted or added unnecessarily.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the intended meaning, uses appropriate vocabulary, and reads naturally for a Spanish audience. Minor stylistic refinements could raise fluency to perfection, but the current version is already excellent for the intended context.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 19/20."
