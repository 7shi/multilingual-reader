  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The provided text is a chaotic mixture of Spanish, French, English, code snippets, and meta‑commentary. Sentences are fragmented, many sections are not in Spanish at all, and the overall structure is unintelligible to a Spanish‑speaking reader.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Fluency cannot be assessed because the output is not a coherent Spanish translation. It contains numerous untranslated fragments, abrupt switches between languages, and placeholder comments, making it far from natural or smooth.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is inconsistently handled; some terms are left in French or English, others are incorrectly translated, and many appear within unrelated commentary. There is no consistent or appropriate terminology usage.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent and tone of the French podcast script are lost amid the mixed‑language output. The translation does not convey the friendly yet formal register, nor does it adapt cultural references appropriately.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Critical portions of the original French dialogue are omitted, garbled, or replaced by unrelated notes. Important information about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, and the concluding gratitude is missing or incomprehensible.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "The submitted ‘translation’ is not a viable Spanish version of the original French text. It is a disordered collection of fragments, code, and meta‑instructions that fails to deliver a readable, fluent, technically accurate, context‑appropriate, and complete translation. According to the evaluation guidelines, this constitutes a missing or incomplete translation, warranting a score of zero across all criteria.\n\nScore: 0/20"
