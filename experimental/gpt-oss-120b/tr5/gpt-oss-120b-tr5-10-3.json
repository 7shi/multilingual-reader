  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clearly expressed. Sentences are a bit long in places, but the flow remains understandable for a typical listener. Minor hiccups (e.g., “cuando se sube al sillón”) slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, but a few expressions are awkward or overly colloquial (e.g., “chuleta”, “sillón”). Some word choices could be refined to sound more neutral and professional, which prevents a perfect score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinado”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL”, “anclaje (grounding)”. The translation keeps consistency and uses accepted Spanish equivalents.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references adequately. However, the use of very informal slang (“chuleta”) and the incorrect metaphor (“sillón” instead of “bicicleta”) reduce the adaptation quality.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is preserved; no significant omissions or added redundancies are observed. The content remains complete and faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. Readability and terminology are strong points, while fluency and cultural nuance could be polished, especially avoiding inaccurate metaphors and overly colloquial terms. The translation would be very effective for a Spanish‑speaking audience after minor edits.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20.\nScore out of 20 points: 17"
