  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is easy to follow. Sentences are mostly short and the concepts are explained clearly. The flow of the dialogue mirrors the original and a Spanish‑speaking listener can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds generally natural, but there are a few minor awkward constructions (e.g., “las informaciones”, “el contexto pasado”, omission of an exclamation after “¡Exactamente!”). These do not break comprehension but reduce smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, ICL, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje (grounding), ventana de contexto, etc. No mistranslations or inconsistencies were found.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts expressions appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral and the tone of a podcast is preserved.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information is conveyed, but the opening self‑introduction of Luc (\"Et je suis Luc.\") is omitted, and a small interjection \"Exactement!\" is missing later. These are minor gaps, yet they affect completeness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and reads well, with only slight lapses in fluency and a small omission of a line of dialogue. The terminology is spot‑on, and the adaptation to Spanish is effective. Minor stylistic tweaks (singular \"información\" instead of \"informaciones\", smoother phrasing) would bring it to near‑perfect level.\nOverall score (average of the criteria): 18/20."
