  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the flow of ideas follows the original script. However, there are several remnants of French (e.g., “Précisément.”, “ancrage”), duplicated or misplaced sentences, and occasional grammatical slips (missing accents, inconsistent capitalization). These interruptions require the reader to pause, lowering overall readability.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound natural, but a noticeable number feel literal or awkward: “Hoy soy Luc. Hoy vamos a descubrir…”, the redundant “ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”, and the abrupt insertion of a new explanatory sentence about “nueva forma de aprendizaje”. The presence of French fragments and occasional incorrect punctuation further detracts from fluency.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered – “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL”. The term “grounding” is left in parentheses with the French word “ancrage”, which could be confusing. Consistency is good overall, but the few untranslated terms prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and the explanatory tone suitable for a podcast audience. Cultural adaptation is adequate (e.g., “consultor brillante”). Nevertheless, the leftover French words and the extra sentence that was not in the source slightly shift the nuance, and the ending uses “próximo capítulo” instead of “próximo episodio”, a minor mismatch.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs permanent knowledge distinction, and the “memoria” feature. No essential information is omitted, though the added sentence about a new learning approach introduces redundancy rather than omission. The occasional French remnants do not delete information but do clutter the text.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content and overall narrative well, but it is marred by several French leftovers, a few awkward phrasing choices, and a spurious inserted sentence. Cleaning up the residual French, smoothing the literal translations, and ensuring consistency in terminology would raise the quality substantially. As it stands, the translation is functional but not polished enough for a native‑speaker audience seeking a smooth listening experience.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 13.4 ≈ 13/20."
