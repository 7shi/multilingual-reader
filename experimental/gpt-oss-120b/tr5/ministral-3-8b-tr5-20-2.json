  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original script. Most sentences are easy to understand, and complex concepts are explained in simple terms. However, there are noticeable errors such as the mixed‑language fragment “Ce sería incroyablement inefficace.” and occasional awkward phrasing that can momentarily confuse the reader.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly sounds natural, but several expressions are literal or stilted (e.g., “El preentrenamiento es un tema que percibimos como fundamental…”, “Ce sería…”, and the inconsistent use of italics and bold). These issues break the smoothness expected from a native‑speaker text.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely handled correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and “anclaje”. The term “prompt” is kept in English, which is acceptable for the target audience. Consistency is good overall.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural references are neutral and appropriate. The only drawback is the untranslated French‑Spanish mix, which feels out of place for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive ideas are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original. Minor stylistic redundancies exist but do not affect completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the content and technical explanations accurately and is largely understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor linguistic slip‑ups—especially the stray French phrase and some literal constructions—prevent it from being fully fluent and polished. With a few edits to smooth out awkward sentences and remove the mixed‑language fragment, the text would reach a higher quality level."
