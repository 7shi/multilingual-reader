  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall easy to follow and the ideas are conveyed clearly. Most sentences are logical and the concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. Minor punctuation errors (missing opening/closing question marks) and a few awkward phrasings slightly hinder smooth reading, but they do not block comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural, but there are several non‑native constructions: \"la IAL\" instead of ICL, \"memorización\" for the memory feature, and occasional verb‑tense oddities. The use of \"entre bastidores\" and other idiomatic expressions is good, yet the overall flow is interrupted by these hiccups.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly – preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning (afinado), transferencia de aprendizaje, ventana de contexto, anclaje, etc. Consistency suffers with the mistaken acronym \"IAL\" and the occasional untranslated English word \"prompt\" left as \"entrada\" without clarification. Nevertheless, the terminology is appropriate for the intended audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational tone of a podcast is preserved, and cultural references are suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Small typographic issues (missing question marks) and a few literal translations reduce naturalness, but the intent and purpose of the original are well conveyed.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant content is omitted. All the main points about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the \"memory\" feature are retained. The only drawback is the accidental change of the acronym ICL to IAL, which could cause slight confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and communicates the original material effectively. It captures the educational podcast style and retains the technical depth. The main areas for improvement are consistency of technical acronyms, punctuation according to Spanish norms, and smoothing a few non‑native expressions. With these refinements, the text would read as fully native and polished.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
