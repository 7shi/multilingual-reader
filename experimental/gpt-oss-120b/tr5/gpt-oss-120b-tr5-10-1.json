  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained clearly. A few minor hiccups—such as “del sillón” instead of a more natural “de la silla” or “del asiento”—slightly affect smoothness, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the text sounds natural, but there are occasional literal translations and typographic remnants from the French original (e.g., the use of French quotation marks « … », the English word “prompt”, and the phrase “del sillón”). These create a slightly stilted feeling for native speakers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinado”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL”, and “anclaje” are correctly rendered. The occasional retention of English words like “prompt” is acceptable in a technical podcast context, and the translation consistently uses the same Spanish equivalents throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a conversational podcast. Cultural references are neutral, and the Spanish phrasing generally feels appropriate for the target audience. Minor oddities (e.g., “del sillón”) are the only noticeable mismatches with typical Spanish usage.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary material. The structure mirrors the original, keeping the content concise and complete.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, conveying the technical discussion clearly and accurately. While the readability and terminology are strong, fluency suffers slightly from a few literal renderings and typographic artifacts. A small amount of polishing—especially replacing odd word choices like “del sillón” and standardizing quotation marks—would bring the text to a near‑perfect level.\nOverall score: 88/100.\nThe translation is ready for publication after minor editorial tweaks.\n\n**Breakdown:** Readability 17, Fluency 16, Terminology 18, Contextual Adaptation 17, Information Completeness 20 = **88** total points."
