  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in simple language. Sentence structures are logical, and the dialogue format preserves the original flow. Minor issues like occasional long sentences do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few awkward constructions appear (e.g., \"Es por eso una memoria de un solo uso\", missing verb; the repetition \"aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\" is slightly redundant). Vocabulary choice is appropriate, yet occasional literal renderings feel a bit stiff. Overall, a native speaker would understand without effort, though the text could be smoothed.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\" are all appropriate Spanish equivalents. Consistency is maintained throughout. The only minor point is the translation of \"prompt\" as \"solicitud\", which is acceptable but could be left as the borrowed term for clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the conversational, podcast‑like tone and adapts cultural references (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenidos\"). The intent and purpose of the original are fully conveyed, and the examples remain relatable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Small phrasing quirks do not affect the overall adaptation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No significant details are omitted, and the logical progression of ideas is intact. The translation also avoids unnecessary redundancy while keeping the content comprehensive.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid overall, delivering the technical content in a clear and mostly natural Spanish. Readability and terminology are strong, and the entire message is preserved. Fluency could be improved with minor re‑phrasing, and a few literal choices could be refined for smoother native expression. Nevertheless, the text would be well‑understood by the target audience and serves its purpose effectively.\n\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 87/100."
