  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are short and the logical flow mirrors the original French script. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained with clear examples. A few minor punctuation quirks (e.g., extra commas) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation sounds natural, but there are a handful of awkward constructions: “Miren ustedes:” feels overly colloquial for a podcast script, “es del bachotaje” is an uncommon expression, and some verb agreements are slightly off (e.g., “cuando abres una nueva ventana, partes”). These issues break the smoothness expected from native‑speaker prose.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino (fine‑tuning)”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (In‑Context Learning)”, and “anclaje (grounding)” are correctly rendered and consistently used throughout. The occasional use of “consultor brillante” instead of a more neutral “consultor experto” does not affect technical accuracy.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a friendly, explanatory podcast. Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. A few phrases (e.g., “Miren ustedes”) feel a bit too direct for the medium, but overall the adaptation respects the target audience’s expectations.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All relevant information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as the original. Redundancies are minimal, and the content stays concise while keeping the nuance of the discussion.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. Readability is good, terminology is spot‑on, and the essential information is fully retained. Fluency suffers from a few unnatural expressions, and the adaptation could be slightly smoother in some colloquial turns. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience, with only minor stylistic tweaks needed to reach native‑level polish.\n\n**Overall Score:** 17/20"
