  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the sentences are easy to follow. Complex ideas such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto are explained clearly, preserving the pedagogical tone of the original. Minor verbosity in a few sentences does not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for native Spanish speakers. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, and idiomatic expressions (e.g., \"¡Una analogía perfecta!\", \"consultor brillante\") are well rendered. A couple of minor awkward constructions (“en la ventana de contexto” instead of “ventana de contexto”) are negligible.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is consistently handled. Key terms (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, grounding, memoria a corto plazo) are correctly translated, with English acronyms kept in parentheses when useful. No confusing or inaccurate terms are introduced.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and didactic purpose. Cultural references are neutral, and the conversational style fits a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience. The adaptation does not introduce any French‑specific idioms that would feel out of place.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No sentences or concepts are omitted, and the explanatory parentheticals (e.g., *fine‑tuning*) are retained. The content remains concise without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, reads smoothly, and adapts well to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic tweaks could raise fluency a point or two, but the work is solid and faithful to the source.\n\nStrengths: clear exposition of complex AI concepts, consistent terminology, complete transfer of information. Areas for slight improvement: occasional phrasing could be tightened for even more natural flow.\n\nOverall rating: 18/20."
