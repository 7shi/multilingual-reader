    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and the flow of ideas follows the original script. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can grasp. Sentence structures are mostly logical, and the dialogue format is preserved, making it easy to follow.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and the conversational tone is kept. A few constructions feel slightly forced or literal (e.g., \"Esta es la realidad del ICL (Lenguaje de Comprensión e Interpretación)\" and \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\"), but they do not seriously impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally handled well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"ventana de contexto\" are accurate. The main problem is the mistranslation of the ICL acronym: it is rendered as \"Lenguaje de Comprensión e Interpretación\", which is incorrect and could confuse readers familiar with the term \"In‑Context Learning\". This inconsistency lowers the score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent, keeps the podcast’s informal style, and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., keeping the show name \"Tech Éclair\" unchanged, which is acceptable). No cultural mismatches are introduced, and the examples (consultant vs. expert) remain effective for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present: the stages of model development, the contrast between fine‑tuning and in‑context learning, the notion of temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of the emerging \"Memoria\" feature. No substantive information is omitted, and the translation does not add irrelevant material.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is very good. It conveys the technical content clearly, maintains the conversational rhythm of the podcast, and is largely fluent. The principal drawback is the inaccurate rendering of the ICL acronym, which could mislead readers about the meaning of the term. Apart from that, the text is readable, culturally appropriate, and complete. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve naturalness, but the translation succeeds in delivering the original message effectively to a Spanish‑speaking audience."
