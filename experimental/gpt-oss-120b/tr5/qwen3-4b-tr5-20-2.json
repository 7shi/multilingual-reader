  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the logical flow mirrors the original French script. Most sentences are clear, and complex concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) are explained in simple language. Minor typographical errors such as \"cramar\" instead of \"empollar\" and \"conversión única\" instead of \"conversación única\" slightly disrupt comprehension, but they do not prevent understanding.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few expressions feel awkward: \"Hola y bienvenido/a en\" should be \"Hola y bienvenido/a a\", the mix of formal \"Usted\" with the informal podcast tone, and punctuation quirks like \"¡\" spaced incorrectly. These issues prevent a fully native‑speaker feeling, yet overall the language flows well.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled excellently. Key terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje\" are correctly rendered and consistently used. The occasional retention of English terms (e.g., \"fine‑tuning\" briefly) does not harm comprehension.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral, and the script remains appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor register inconsistencies (formal vs. informal) slightly affect adaptation, but the overall message is conveyed accurately.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present. No sections are omitted, and the explanations are kept intact. The only drawbacks are typographical slips that do not delete content but could cause momentary confusion.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and conveys the technical content of the original French podcast clearly. It excels in terminology and completeness, while readability and fluency are only marginally affected by a handful of minor errors and stylistic inconsistencies. With a quick proofreading pass to correct the small typos and adjust the register, the text would be near‑perfect for a native‑speaker audience.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17.6 → rounded to 18/20.\n\nOverall Score (out of 20): 18\n\nThe translation is high‑quality, requiring only minimal polishing for full naturalness and consistency.\n\n---\n**Scoring Summary**\n- Readability: 17/20\n- Fluency: 16/20\n- Terminology: 19/20\n- Contextual Adaptation: 17/20\n- Information Completeness: 19/20\n- **Overall Score:** 18/20**"
