  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is difficult to follow because it mixes the translated dialogue with extensive meta‑comments, instructions and parenthetical notes. Speaker names change inconsistently (\"Luc\", \"Lucas\", \"Lucas\"), and many lines contain bracketed explanations that would never appear in a podcast script. This disrupts the flow and makes it hard for a reader to understand the conversation.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While some sentences are well‑formed, many are awkward or literal translations (e.g., \"ancoraje\" instead of the common \"anclaje\", \"memoria a utilización única\", \"se trata de una memoria a utilización única\"). The presence of English fragments, duplicated punctuation and inconsistent use of capitalisation also hurt naturalness. Overall the text does not read like fluent Spanish spoken by native speakers.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"ICL\" are mostly preserved, which is good. However, some terms are mistranslated or inconsistently rendered (\"ancoraje\" vs \"anclaje\", \"memoria a utilización única\" is non‑standard, \"memorización\" instead of \"memoria\"), and occasional English terms remain untranslated. Consistency could be improved.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original podcast tone (informative, conversational) is lost due to the insertion of instructional notes and the lack of smooth transitions. Cultural adaptation is minimal; some expressions feel literal and do not consider typical Spanish podcast phrasing. The overall intent is partially conveyed but the delivery is far from optimal for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the core ideas from the French script are present, but several sentences are truncated, omitted, or replaced by explanatory side‑bars. Important nuances (e.g., the distinction between \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"afinamiento\") are sometimes buried under meta‑text, and some parts of the dialogue are missing entirely. Redundancy is also present because of repeated explanatory notes.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures many of the technical concepts but is marred by a chaotic blend of the target text with meta‑instructions, inconsistent speaker naming, and several unnatural phrasings. Terminology is largely correct but not consistently applied, and the flow is severely disrupted, making the result hard to read and not suitable for a podcast audience. Substantial editing would be required to produce a clean, fluent, and listener‑friendly Spanish version.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 8 out of 20."
