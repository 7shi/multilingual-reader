  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the structure of the original dialogue. Most sentences convey the intended meaning, but there are several awkward constructions (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en”, “Vea:”, “Las conocencias”, “El aprendizaje en contexto es el apretar”) that may cause momentary confusion for readers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Numerous phrasing issues break the natural flow: missing prepositions, literal translations of French idioms, gender/number mismatches (\"las nuevas conocimientos\"), and an inappropriate verb choice (“apretar” for “bachotage”). These errors make the text sound non‑native.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" are correctly rendered. The term \"grounding\" is translated as \"anclaje (sostén)\", which is acceptable. However, some lexical choices (\"conocencias\" instead of \"conocimientos\") are inaccurate, slightly reducing precision.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and overall message, but cultural and idiomatic adaptation is uneven. Phrases like \"Hola y bienvenido en\" and the literal use of \"antisèche\" (rendered as \"anticipación\") feel out of place for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present; no major information is omitted. Minor stylistic redundancies appear, but they do not affect the factual content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core ideas of the podcast fairly well and includes most technical terminology correctly. Nonetheless, fluency and naturalness suffer from several literal translations and grammatical slips, which hinder readability for native Spanish speakers. Improving idiomatic expressions, fixing gender/number agreement, and polishing awkward phrases would raise the overall quality substantially.\nOverall score (out of 100): 72/100.\nRecommendation: Revise the problematic sentences, replace incorrect words (e.g., \"conocencias\" → \"conocimientos\"), and adapt idioms to Spanish conventions to achieve a more fluid and professional translation.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 14/20, Fluency 12/20, Terminology 15/20, Contextual Adaptation 13/20, Information Completeness 18/20.\n\nTotal: 72/100."
