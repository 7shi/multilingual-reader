    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is riddled with fragmented sentences, parenthetical meta‑comments, and unrelated instructional excerpts (e.g., language‑learning lessons, dictionary definitions). The flow of the original podcast dialogue is lost; readers have to jump between unrelated blocks to make any sense. Because of these disruptions, a native Spanish reader would struggle to follow the conversation at all.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Even when the content is roughly on topic, the wording is often unnatural (e.g., “approachedebatiendo”, “affinage” left untranslated, mixed English/French terms, literal translations like “la IA no ha ‘olvidado’”). Verb agreement errors, missing accent marks, and awkward constructions (“El pre‑entrenamiento. ¡El pre‑entrenamiento! 😏/”) make the text sound like a machine‑generated collage rather than fluent Spanish.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL) are sometimes rendered correctly, but many are left in French, misspelled, or replaced by unrelated synonyms. Consistency is lacking (e.g., “affinage”, “afino”, “Afino”). No effort is made to explain terms for a lay audience, and several technical phrases are outright wrong or missing.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation does not preserve the original podcast’s conversational tone nor its pedagogical intent. It inserts unrelated teaching snippets, explanatory footnotes, and even a “library” word‑learning exercise that never existed in the source. Cultural adaptation is absent; the text feels disjointed and fails to convey the original purpose of informing listeners about AI training methods.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are omitted or replaced by irrelevant content (e.g., instructions on how to ask age in Spanish, random lists of translations). Important nuances—such as the distinction between in‑context learning and fine‑tuning, the analogy of a consultant vs. a permanent expert—are either lost or heavily distorted. Consequently, the translation does not faithfully transmit the source information.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "overall_comment": "The provided \"translation\" is essentially a patchwork of fragmented translations, explanatory side‑bars, and unrelated language‑learning material. It fails on almost every evaluation dimension: readability, fluency, terminology handling, contextual fidelity, and completeness. A proper translation would keep the podcast dialogue intact, use natural Spanish phrasing, consistently render technical terms, and omit extraneous instructional content. As it stands, the text would be incomprehensible and unhelpful to Spanish‑speaking listeners seeking the original content.\n\n**Overall quality: very poor.**"
