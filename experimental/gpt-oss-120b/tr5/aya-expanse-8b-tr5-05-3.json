    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the dialogue format is preserved. However, stray quotation marks (e.g., \"Camille: \"Camille: …\") and occasional French terms left untranslated interrupt the flow, requiring the reader to pause. Overall the content is understandable, but these minor typographical issues prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural constructions: the French phrase \"pré‑entrenamiento\" is kept in quotes, \"ancrage\" is not translated, and some sentences are overly literal (“la IA olvida todo” vs. a more natural “la IA lo olvida todo”). Vocabulary is mostly appropriate, but the mixture of languages and occasional word‑order issues make the prose sound a bit stilted for native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly (e.g., \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\", \"ICL\"). Nevertheless, the handling is inconsistent: \"fine‑tuning\" becomes \"ajuste fino\" (good), but \"pré‑entraînement\" and \"ancrage\" remain in French, and \"grounding\" is never translated. This inconsistency can confuse readers unfamiliar with the original French terminology.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent and tone are preserved, and cultural references (consultant, bicicleta) are well adapted. The brand name \"Tech Éclair\" is left unchanged, which is acceptable for a proper name. The main drawback is the occasional retention of French terms that feel out‑of‑place for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No substantive information is omitted, though minor formatting glitches (duplicate speaker tags) slightly affect presentation.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and keeps the technical discussion intact. Readability and completeness are strong, but fluency suffers from occasional untranslated French terms and awkward phrasing. Terminology consistency needs improvement to avoid mixing languages within the same passage. With a few edits—translating the remaining French terms, cleaning up punctuation, and smoothing literal constructions—the translation would read like a natural, polished Spanish podcast script.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15.2/20."
