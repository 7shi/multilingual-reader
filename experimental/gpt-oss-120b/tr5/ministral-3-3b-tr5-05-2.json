    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original flow, but several sentences are awkward or incomplete (e.g., “El afinado.” standing alone, “los morfos”). Some pronoun inconsistencies (\"sus\" vs \"vuestras\") and missing connective words make the reading experience a bit choppy. Overall, a native reader can grasp the meaning, but the clarity is occasionally hindered.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are multiple unnatural expressions: “Los morfos”, “Capa de Cachado de Inferencia”, and the isolated phrase “El afinado.”. The mix of Spanish varieties (vosotros/vuestras) also breaks the natural flow. While most sentences are grammatical, the overall style feels stilted and occasionally confusing for a native speaker.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly translated correctly (preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding → anclaje). However, the term “fine‑tuning” disappears, and the invented phrase “Capa de Cachado de Inferencia” is inaccurate. Some jargon such as “los morfos” is not standard Spanish terminology.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally respects the podcast tone and adapts the content for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Nevertheless, occasional mismatches (e.g., mixed pronouns, regional forms) and the odd technical phrase mentioned above reduce the cultural and contextual fit.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original information is present, but a few details are omitted or altered: the explicit mention of “fine‑tuning”, the precise definition of “grounding”, and the nuanced explanation of memory functions. Redundant or confusing additions (e.g., “los morfos”) also affect completeness.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main ideas of the podcast and is largely understandable, but it suffers from several linguistic inaccuracies, inconsistent terminology, and occasional loss of nuance. A revision focusing on fixing awkward phrases, restoring omitted technical terms, and ensuring consistent terminology would raise the quality significantly.\nOverall, the translation sits at a moderate level of quality, suitable for a general audience but not yet polished for a professional or technical readership.\n\nOverall Score (average of criteria): 13/20."
