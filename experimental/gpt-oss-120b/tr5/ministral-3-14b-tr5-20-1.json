  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow; complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained with clear analogies. Sentence structure is logical and the dialogue format is preserved. Minor issues (mixed formal/informal pronouns) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places and uses appropriate colloquial Spanish (e.g., “¡Exactamente!”, “¡Aprenderá francés a una velocidad increíble!”). A few expressions feel literal (“competencia está anclada”, asterisk‑marked asides) and the alternation between “tú”, “usted” and “vuestras” is slightly inconsistent, which creates mild awkwardness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL*, *memoria a corto plazo*. The translation keeps the terminology consistent and adds helpful clarifications when needed.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original podcast are preserved, and cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only drawback is the occasional shift between formal and informal registers, which slightly reduces the seamless adaptation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No content has been omitted, and the added explanatory notes (e.g., translation of acronyms) aid understanding without adding redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the original content accurately, uses appropriate technical vocabulary, and is largely readable and natural. Minor stylistic inconsistencies (pronoun register, a few literal translations) prevent a perfect score but do not affect the listener’s understanding.\n\nThe translation would serve well for a Spanish‑language podcast audience, requiring only a quick proofread to harmonize the register and smooth a few slightly awkward phrases.\n\nScore out of 20: 18/20.\n\n---\n**Breakdown**\n- Readability: 18/20\n- Fluency: 16/20\n- Terminology: 19/20\n- Contextual Adaptation: 17/20\n- Information Completeness: 20/20\n- **Overall**: 18/20"
