    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is riddled with incoherent fragments (e.g., repeated “Hola”, “Hola, mundo”, “Por favor, escribe en español.”) and placeholders like “El texto no contiene una traducción…”. Sentences are cut off, making it very hard for a reader to follow the dialogue or grasp the concepts. The logical flow of the original podcast script is essentially lost.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Numerous expressions are unnatural or outright wrong for native Spanish speakers. The translation inserts English‑style interjections, repeats greetings unnecessarily, and includes system‑generated messages that do not belong in a podcast transcript. Grammar is often broken, and the vocabulary choices are erratic, resulting in a stilted, non‑fluid text.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and “anclaje” are at least present, but many are omitted, mistranslated, or left ambiguous. Important explanations that accompany these terms in French are missing or truncated, reducing clarity for a technical audience.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to preserve the original intent and tone of a conversational podcast. Cultural references and the educational style are disrupted by random interjections and missing content. The result is a script that does not engage Spanish‑speaking listeners as intended.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are absent (e.g., the analogy about the consultant, the detailed explanation of memory vs. fine‑tuning, and the concluding remarks). System messages replace actual content, leading to significant loss of information.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is severely defective. It contains numerous filler lines, missing sections, and system‑generated placeholders that break the narrative. While some technical vocabulary is retained, the overall text is incoherent, un‑natural, and incomplete, making it unusable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. A complete re‑translation, preserving the podcast flow and removing all extraneous system messages, is required.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 4/20."
