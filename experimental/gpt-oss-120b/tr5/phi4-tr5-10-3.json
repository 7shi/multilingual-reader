  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas without heavy jargon, and the flow of the podcast dialogue is preserved. Minor hiccups (e.g., the phrase “Aprendizaje In‑contextual”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most of the script, but a few constructions feel slightly forced or retain English terms (“prompt”, “AICL”). Phrases like “masiva expansión de la memoria a corto plazo” are correct but a bit clunky. Overall, native speakers would understand it comfortably.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, anclaje (grounding). Consistency is maintained throughout. The only slight weakness is the mixed use of English loanwords (prompt, AICL) without Spanish equivalents, which could be smoother.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal, conversational tone of a podcast and adapts cultural references appropriately. The use of Spanish interjections (¡Exacto!, ¡Perfecta analogía!) fits the target audience. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve flow, but the intent and purpose are fully conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French script is present. No ideas are omitted or incorrectly altered, and the structure mirrors the source. Redundancies are avoided, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It faithfully transmits the technical content and the lively podcast style, with only occasional anglicisms and slightly awkward phrasing that prevent a perfect score. Minor polishing (e.g., fully Spanishizing terms like “prompt” and smoothing some long sentences) would bring it to an excellent level.\n\nFinal score (out of 100): 89/100."
