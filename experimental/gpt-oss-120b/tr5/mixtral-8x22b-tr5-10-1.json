  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are easy to follow. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained clearly. A few sentences are long, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are several awkward expressions: \"El afino\" for \"affinage\", the use of \"sugerencia\" for \"prompt\", and the retention of the French word \"bachotage\". These moments slightly break the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly (preentrenamiento, ventana de contexto, transferencia, anclaje). However, inconsistency appears with \"afino\" vs. \"afinamiento\" and the abbreviation \"AIC\" is not a common Spanish acronym. The translation of \"prompt\" as \"sugerencia\" is acceptable but less precise than keeping the English term.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original podcast are preserved. Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience, and the analogies (consultor brillante, aprender a montar en bicicleta) work well. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve polish, but the overall adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is retained. No significant content is omitted, and the translation adds no unnecessary redundancy. The key points about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning and the \"memoria\" feature are all present.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original material accurately and is generally clear. It reads well for a technical audience, though a few lexical choices (especially \"afino\", \"sugerencia\" and the leftover French term \"bachotage\") detract from full naturalness. Consistency in terminology would raise the quality further. Overall, it is a strong translation with minor room for improvement."
