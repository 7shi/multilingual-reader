  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. However, the misspelling “crammar” (instead of a proper Spanish verb such as “empollar”) and a few overly long sentences slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural, but there are several awkward constructions: “crammar”, the use of “afinamiento” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”, unnecessary commas, and occasional literal translations that feel stilted. These issues prevent the text from fully sounding like native‑speaker Spanish.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely accurate: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, etc. The choice of “anclaje” for grounding is acceptable though not the most common term. Overall the terminology is consistent and appropriate for the intended audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references well. The main drawback is the literal use of “crammar”, which is not a Spanish word, and a few phrasing choices that could be more idiomatic. Nevertheless, the overall message is preserved for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No relevant segment is omitted, and the supplemental explanations (e.g., about memory features) are retained.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and keeps the technical depth intact. Minor lexical errors (notably “crammar”) and some less‑natural phrasing prevent it from achieving full fluency, but the overall quality is good and understandable for the target audience. Improvements should focus on fixing the misspelled verb, choosing more idiomatic equivalents for terms like “afinamiento”, and smoothing out sentence rhythm.\n\nOverall rating (average of the five criteria): 15.6 → 16/20."
