  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall understandable and follows the podcast dialogue structure. However, a few phrasing choices such as \"La fase de calentamiento\" for \"pré‑entraînement\" and the occasional Portuguese word \"brilhante\" make the reading slightly less smooth for a native Spanish audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences flow naturally, but there are noticeable awkward constructions (e.g., \"El ajuste\" for \"fine‑tuning\", \"consultor brilhante\" mixing Portuguese, and the exclamation \"¡Tech Éclair!\"). These lower the natural feel of the translation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved: \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"anclaje\". The translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"ajuste\" is imprecise; the more common \"ajuste fino\" would be clearer. Overall consistency is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The tone, humor, and explanatory style of the original are retained, and the cultural context (podcast format) is respected. Minor issues such as the mixed‑language word \"brilhante\" and the unusual punctuation around the show title slightly affect adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, transfer learning, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, grounding, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the “memory” feature. No significant information is omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and keeps the educational, conversational tone of the podcast. It is readable and complete, but several lexical choices feel unnatural or borrow from other languages, and some technical terms could be rendered more precisely. Improving those points would raise fluency and readability significantly.\nOverall, the work is solid with room for refinement in idiomatic expression and terminology consistency.\nOverall score (average): 15/20."
