  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand. The flow of ideas follows the original and complex concepts are explained clearly. Minor hiccups (e.g., the isolated \"Camille: preentrenamiento\" line and the missing speaker introduction for Luc) slightly disrupt smooth reading, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several unnaturally phrased sentences: \"levantar el velo sobre cómo…\" lacks a subject, the verb \"soy\" is omitted for Luc, and the pronoun usage switches between \"tus\" and \"vuestras\". Some translations keep English terms like \"prompt\" without adaptation, which feels a bit jarring. Overall the text sounds like a literal translation rather than natural Spanish speech.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje (grounding)\" are correctly rendered. The word \"prompt\" is left in English, which is acceptable for a technical audience, but a Spanish equivalent or brief explanation would be preferable for full consistency.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural adaptation is adequate; the only issue is the inconsistent use of \"tus\" vs. \"vuestras\", which reflects a mix of Latin‑American and Iberian Spanish. Apart from that, the content is well adapted for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present. The only noticeable omission is the explicit speaker introduction for Luc (\"Et je suis Luc.\") and a tiny loss of emphasis in a few places. No substantive information is dropped, and no redundant material is added.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical discussion accurately and is largely understandable, but it suffers from occasional awkward phrasing, inconsistent pronouns, and a couple of minor omissions. Technical terminology is strong, though the handling of English‑only terms could be refined. With a few editorial adjustments, the Spanish version would read more naturally and maintain full fidelity to the original podcast script.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 82/100."
