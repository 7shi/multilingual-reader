  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the pedagogical analogies (graduado, consultor, examen) are preserved, helping the reader grasp abstract concepts. A few minor hiccups – such as the occasional switch from “usted” to “tú/contigo” – slightly affect flow, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, using idiomatic Spanish (e.g., “una ventana de contexto”, “una habilidad permanente”). However, there are occasional awkward constructions (“un apunte justo antes de empezar a hablar contigo”, “funciones de memoria son una forma ingeniosa”) and an inconsistent use of the podcast name (“Tech Flash” vs. the original “Tech Éclair”), which slightly break the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well‑handled: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “ventana de contexto”. The main drawback is the inconsistent rendering of “grounding” as both “enraizamiento” and “ancoraje”, which could confuse readers. Otherwise the terminology is appropriate for a general‑tech audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience, preserving the informal podcast tone and using culturally neutral examples. The only notable issue is the change of the podcast title to “Tech Flash”, which departs from the original brand and may cause confusion. Apart from that, the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas, analogies, and details from the French original are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted, and no redundant material is added. The translation is faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original material accurately and maintains a clear, educational tone. Minor inconsistencies in naming, occasional awkward phrasing, and the dual translation of “grounding” prevent it from being flawless, but the core message and technical content are well preserved. The work would benefit from a final polish to unify terminology and ensure consistent use of pronouns and brand names.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20.\n\nScore out of 20: 17"
