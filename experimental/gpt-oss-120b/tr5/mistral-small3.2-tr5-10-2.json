  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences convey the original meaning, but occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., “informaciones específicas”) slightly hinders smooth comprehension. Overall, a native reader can understand the content without major effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few literal renderings and mismatches in register (mix of formal ‘usted’ and informal tone, “es como empollar”, “informaciones”). These do not break comprehension but make the flow feel a bit stilted for a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly transferred and consistently used: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, ventana de contexto, grounding, etc. The occasional decision to keep the English word in parentheses is appropriate for a technical audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts cultural references well (e.g., “chuleta” for cheat‑sheet). The main drawback is the inconsistent use of formal vs. informal address, which slightly alters the conversational tone of the original French dialogue.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant details are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original, keeping the content complete and coherent.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is accurate and conveys the technical concepts clearly. Minor issues with fluency, register consistency, and a few lexical choices prevent it from being fully natural, but the overall quality is high and suitable for a tech‑savvy audience.\n\nStrengths: faithful terminology, complete information, good contextual adaptation. Areas for improvement: smoothness of phrasing and consistent tone throughout the dialogue.\n\nOverall score reflects a solid translation that only needs modest polishing to reach native‑like fluency.\n\nScore out of 20: 17/20."
