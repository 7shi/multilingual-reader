    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logical and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained clearly. There are a few minor redundancies (e.g., “aprendizaje en contexto, o AIC (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”) that slightly affect flow, but overall a French‑speaking audience would understand without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are occasional awkward constructions and repetitions (e.g., “una cantidad mucho menor de texto en francés”, “ventana de contexto” repeated, and the acronym change to AIC). Some phrasing could be smoother, but a native Spanish speaker would have no trouble comprehending the dialogue.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well handled: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, anclaje, etc. The main issues are the use of “afinaje” (less common than “ajuste fino”) and the substitution of the original acronym ICL with “AIC”, which could confuse readers familiar with the English literature.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience, preserving the podcast tone and using familiar analogies (consultor, bicicleta). Cultural references are neutral and the intent of the original is maintained. Minor wording choices could be refined, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as in the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the original podcast’s educational narrative accurately. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency suffers from a few repetitive or non‑idiomatic phrases and the unconventional acronym change. Minor terminology tweaks (e.g., using “ajuste fino” instead of “afinaje”) would raise the quality further. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation that would be well understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners."
