    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the ideas in a clear and logical order. Sentences are generally easy to follow, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained with simple analogies. A few sentences are long, but they remain comprehensible for the intended audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker, with appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic phrasing. Minor issues are present: the word *afinamiento* is less common than *ajuste fino*, and the phrase *una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje contextual automático* sounds a bit awkward. These do not break comprehension but slightly affect smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *ventana de contexto*, *anclaje* (grounding), *memoria a corto plazo* are accurate. The choice of *afinamiento* for “fine‑tuning” is acceptable but not the most usual term; the abbreviation *AICL* is introduced even though the original uses *ICL*. Overall consistency is good and explanations are kept when needed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., “consultor brillante”). The tone remains conversational and the podcast format is preserved. No culturally inappropriate expressions appear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No relevant details are omitted, and the added parenthetical expansions (e.g., “Aprendizaje In‑contextual”) do not distort meaning. Redundancy is minimal and the content stays concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is high‑quality. It faithfully reproduces the original dialogue, maintains the educational tone, and makes the technical content accessible to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor lexical choices (such as *afinamiento* and a slightly clunky phrase) prevent a perfect score, but they do not hinder understanding. The work is clear, accurate, and well‑adapted to the target audience."
