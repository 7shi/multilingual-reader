  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall easy to understand. The main ideas and examples are conveyed clearly, and the dialogue flow is preserved. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., gender‑number mismatches) and a single mixed‑language sentence slightly hinder smooth reading, but the content remains comprehensible.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward expressions and errors: \"inmensas conocimientos\", \"las nuevas conocimientos\", \"silla\" instead of \"bicicleta\", inconsistency between \"afinamiento\" and \"afinado\", and a French fragment left untranslated. These issues reduce the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, y aprendizaje contextual are handled correctly. However, the inconsistent use of \"afinamiento\"/\"afinado\" and the gender‑agreement errors with \"conocimientos\" show a lack of consistency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original intent well for a Spanish‑speaking audience, using appropriate analogies and culturally neutral language. The only drawback is the untranslated French sentence, which momentarily breaks the adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present. No major ideas are omitted, and the explanations remain intact despite the minor linguistic errors.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation accurately captures the technical content and overall message of the podcast, making the material accessible to Spanish readers. Nevertheless, recurring grammatical inaccuracies, inconsistent terminology, and a stray French clause detract from its polish and fluency. A careful proofread and terminology standardisation would bring it to a higher quality level.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
