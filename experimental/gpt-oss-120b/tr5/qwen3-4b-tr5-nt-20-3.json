  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation interleaves the original dialogue with extensive meta‑annotations (vocabulaire clé, intentions, contexte, etc.). This breaks the flow of the conversation, making it hard for a typical Spanish‑speaking podcast listener to follow. Sentence structures are often long and cumbersome, and the presence of brackets and bullet points distracts from comprehension.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are many unnatural phrasings (e.g., \"las nuevas conocimientos\", \"las conocences\", \"el aprendizaje en contexto en acción\"). Some sentences are literal translations that sound awkward in Spanish. The mix of formal explanatory text with colloquial dialogue further reduces the natural feel.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as « preentrenamiento », « afinamiento », « aprendizaje por transferencia », « ventana de contexto » and « aprendizaje en contexto » are correctly rendered. However, occasional mistakes (\"conocences\" instead of \"conocimientos\", gender agreement errors) and inconsistent handling of English loanwords (e.g., \"ICL\" left untranslated) lower the score.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original podcast tone is conversational and accessible. The translation adds academic‑style annotations that are not present in the source, shifting the register away from the intended audience. While the core ideas are still conveyed, the adaptation does not respect the original medium (audio podcast) and therefore feels mismatched culturally.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points of the original dialogue are present, and no crucial content is omitted. The extra annotations provide additional explanations, but they are not required and sometimes repeat information. The core information is complete, though the added material creates redundancy.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation preserves the factual content of the original French script, but the inclusion of extensive meta‑annotations disrupts readability and naturalness. While technical terminology is largely accurate, several linguistic errors and awkward phrasing affect fluency. The shift from a spoken‑style podcast to a semi‑academic written format reduces the suitability for the intended audience. A cleaner version that keeps only the dialogue, with minor adjustments for natural Spanish, would markedly improve the quality.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 10.6/20."
