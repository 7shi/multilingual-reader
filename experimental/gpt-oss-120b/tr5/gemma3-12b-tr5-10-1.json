  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the flow of ideas mirrors the original French dialogue. A few long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but overall a Spanish‑speaking listener can understand the concepts without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are isolated awkward expressions (e.g., \"es del bachotaje\" instead of \"es como bachotear\", \"una forma inteligente de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\"). Vocabulary is appropriate, yet a couple of constructions feel slightly forced. These minor issues keep the fluency from being perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"grounding (ancaje)\" are all rendered consistently. Where English terms are kept (ICL, grounding) they are explained in Spanish, which helps comprehension. No major terminology errors are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts the discourse to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogy of a consultant is kept. The occasional informal word \"bachotaje\" may feel a bit colloquial but still fits the podcast tone. Overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No key points are omitted, and the supplementary explanations (e.g., what \"grounding\" means) are retained. Redundancy is not introduced, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Readability and completeness are strong, and terminology is consistently handled. Minor fluency hiccups prevent a perfect score, but they do not impede comprehension. With slight polishing of a few awkward phrases, the translation would reach a near‑native level of naturalness.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17.8/20."
