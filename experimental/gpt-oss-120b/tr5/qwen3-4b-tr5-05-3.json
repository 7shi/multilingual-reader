  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the main ideas are conveyed, but several awkward phrasings (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en”, “El aprendizaje en contexto es el apretar”, “Las conocencias”) and grammatical slips (missing prepositions, gender agreement errors) force the reader to pause. The flow is therefore not as smooth as it could be.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are numerous non‑native constructions: inconsistent use of “Usted/has”, literal translations that sound odd (“apretar” for ‘bachotage’, “la silla” for ‘the seat’), and typographical errors like “conocencias” and “las nuevas conocimientos”. These issues make the translation sound stilted rather than natural.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely correctly rendered – “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”. The only minor drawback is the parenthetical “(sostén)” for grounding, which is not a standard translation, but overall the terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent, but cultural‑linguistic adaptation is uneven. Formal “Usted” is used only once, the opening greeting misuses the preposition, and some literal renderings (e.g., “apretar”) do not fit Spanish discourse. Thus the adaptation is only partially effective.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the ideas, examples, and analogies from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No major sections are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original. Minor redundancies or omissions are absent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in transmitting the full content and most of the technical vocabulary, but it is marred by numerous linguistic inaccuracies and unnatural phrasing that reduce readability and fluency. A careful edit by a native‑speaker would be needed to smooth out the errors and make the dialogue sound natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\nOverall, the work is functional but far from polished.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
