  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow, sentences are well‑structured and the concepts are explained clearly. The only minor drawback is the retention of the French word “ancrage” without a Spanish equivalent, which can momentarily interrupt the flow.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally overall. Most expressions are idiomatic, but a few anglicisms (“prompt”) and informal choices (“atiborrarse”) stand out. They do not break comprehension but slightly reduce the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as «pre‑entrenamiento», «ajuste fino», «aprendizaje por transferencia», «ICL» and «ventana de contexto» are correctly rendered and consistent. The term “ancrage (grounding)” is left in French, which could have been translated to “anclaje”, so a small penalty is applied.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original podcast tone and adapts cultural references appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The occasional French loan‑word does not hinder understanding, and the overall intent is preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and nuances from the French original are present. No significant information is omitted or added unnecessarily.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality, conveying the technical discussion in a clear and engaging manner. Minor issues—such as retaining a French technical term and a few informal or anglicised expressions—prevent it from being perfect, but they do not affect the overall comprehension. The translator succeeded in preserving the educational tone and the nuanced comparison between fine‑tuning and in‑context learning.\nOverall rating: 18/20."
