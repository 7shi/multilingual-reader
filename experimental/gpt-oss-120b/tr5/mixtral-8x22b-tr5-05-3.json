  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the main ideas are conveyed, but there are several confusing elements: the incorrect insertion of \"en español\" instead of \"en francés\", an unfinished sentence, and occasional misuse of pronouns (e.g., \"Luc puede\" instead of \"Puedes\"). These issues slightly hinder smooth comprehension for readers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains a number of unnatural constructions and awkward phrasing. Examples include the literal carry‑over of the French word \"bachotage\", the use of \"ancaje\" (less common than \"anclaje\"), and the inconsistent naming of the podcast (\"Tecno Flash\" vs. \"Tech Éclair\"). These make the text feel less natural to a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly rendered. However, the French word \"affinage\" is left untranslated, and \"grounding\" is rendered as \"ancaje\", which is not the usual term. The mixed use of French and Spanish terminology reduces consistency.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly preserves the original intent and tone, but cultural and linguistic adaptation is uneven. The mistaken reference to \"español\" instead of \"francés\" and the inconsistent podcast title show a lack of careful adaptation to the target audience. Overall, the purpose is clear but not optimally localized.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of \"memory\" features. Minor issues such as the incomplete sentence and a few untranslated words do not omit essential information.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the overall narrative and most of the technical content, but it suffers from several linguistic inaccuracies, untranslated French terms, and inconsistencies that affect readability and naturalness. A revision focusing on correcting language errors, using consistent terminology, and polishing phrasing would significantly improve the quality.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 13.4 → rounded to 13/20.\n\nScore: 13"
