  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. Most sentences are clear, and the complex concepts are explained similarly to the French original. Minor issues affect readability, such as missing opening question marks (e.g., \"¿Porque ya entiende…\" should be \"¿Por qué ya entiende…\") and a few punctuation glitches, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are occasional awkward constructions and gender agreement errors (e.g., \"el IA\" instead of \"la IA\"). Some verb choices are literal translations rather than idiomatic Spanish (e.g., \"insertar automáticamente estos extractos en el prompt\" could be \"incluir automáticamente estos fragmentos en la solicitud\"). These hiccups prevent the text from feeling completely native.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinación\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL) and \"anclaje\" are correctly translated or kept in their English form with appropriate quotation marks. Consistency is maintained throughout, and the level of detail matches the intended audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the original intent, tone, and educational style of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is required. A few expressions could be smoother for a Spanish‑speaking audience (e.g., using \"consultor\" vs. \"consultante\"), but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the dialogue structure is preserved. Minor typographical errors do not lead to loss of meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. Minor grammatical slips, punctuation errors, and occasional unnatural phrasing keep it from being perfect, but the core message and pedagogical flow are intact. With a quick proofread focusing on gender agreement, punctuation, and idiomatic phrasing, it would reach a near‑native quality level.\n\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 86/100."
