  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "I cannot assess readability because the French source text and its Spanish translation were not provided. Without seeing the actual sentences, I cannot determine whether the content is clear, logically organized, or easy to understand for Spanish readers.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Fluency evaluation requires examining the Spanish translation for naturalness, idiomatic usage, and smooth grammar. Since the translation is missing, I cannot judge any of these aspects.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "To evaluate technical terminology I need to see the specific terms used in both languages. Without the texts, I cannot verify if terminology is appropriate, consistent, or properly explained.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Assessing contextual adaptation involves checking whether the translation conveys the original intent and respects the cultural background of Spanish readers. This cannot be done without the source and target excerpts.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "I must compare the source and target versions to see if any information is omitted, added, or redundantly repeated. Since the material is not supplied, I cannot perform this comparison.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "The evaluation cannot be performed because the French source text and its Spanish translation were not included in the request. Please provide both the original French passage and the corresponding Spanish translation, and I will gladly assess them according to the specified criteria."
