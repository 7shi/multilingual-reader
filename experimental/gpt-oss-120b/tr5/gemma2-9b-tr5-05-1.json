  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clearly presented. Sentence structures are logical and the flow mirrors the original dialogue. Minor issues such as the French word “Parce” left untranslated and the slightly uncommon term “afianzamiento” for fine‑tuning slightly hinder smooth comprehension, but they do not break understanding.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, using appropriate colloquial Spanish. A few expressions feel a bit forced (“memoria de un solo uso”, “afianzamiento”) and the stray French word is a noticeable slip. Overall the text reads well to a native speaker, but the awkward bits prevent a perfect rating.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly translated correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”. However, “fine‑tuning” is rendered as “afianzamiento” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”, and “grounding” becomes “ancrado”, which is not the usual translation. Consistency suffers slightly, though the meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue, and the examples are understandable for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The only cultural‑linguistic slip is the leftover French word, but otherwise the adaptation respects the target audience’s expectations.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No sections are omitted or altered in meaning; the only flaw is a minor lexical error that does not affect the conveyed content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does an excellent job of conveying the original podcast’s educational content. It is mostly clear, fluent, and complete, with only a handful of lexical slips and less‑than‑ideal term choices that keep it from reaching the highest level of polish. Overall, it is a solid and usable translation for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 16, Fluency 15, Terminology 14, Contextual Adaptation 16, Information Completeness 19 → Total 80/100.\n\nPotential improvements: replace the stray French word with “Porque”, use “ajuste fino” for fine‑tuning, and opt for “anclaje” instead of “ancrado”. These changes would raise both fluency and terminology scores.\n\nOverall rating: 80/100, indicating a good translation with room for minor refinements."
