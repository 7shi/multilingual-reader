    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original script. Most sentences are understandable, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a Spanish‑speaking audience can follow. However, there are a few typographical glitches (e.g., \"recién graduad ouniversitario\", \"Tranformers\"), and occasional mismatches in register that slightly impede smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains several awkward constructions and inconsistent use of pronouns (mixing \"usted\", \"tú\" and \"vosotros\"). Some phrases sound literal (“artiñaña”, “hablarles”) and are not idiomatic. Despite these issues, a native speaker can still grasp the meaning, but the translation does not feel completely natural.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\" and even the English loanword \"grounding\" are correctly rendered and kept consistent. The only minor flaw is the typo \"Tranformers\" instead of \"Transformers\".",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the conversational tone of a podcast and conveys the original intent. Cultural adaptation is adequate, but the mixture of formal and informal second‑person forms (\"usted\" vs \"vosotros\") can feel out of place for many Spanish‑speaking audiences. Some idiomatic expressions could be refined, but overall the purpose is preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the logical sequence is maintained. Minor typographical errors do not cause loss of content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully conveys the technical content and the pedagogical style of the original podcast. Terminology is accurate and consistent, and the main ideas are intact. The main drawbacks are occasional typographical mistakes, inconsistent pronoun usage, and some non‑idiomatic phrasing that affect fluency. With a light editorial pass to fix the glitches and harmonize the register, the translation would be close to native‑speaker quality.\nOverall score (average): 16/20."
