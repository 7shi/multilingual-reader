  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas is easy to follow. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in a straightforward way. Some sentences are long and could be broken up for better readability, and a few minor punctuation issues are present, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part and uses appropriate everyday language. There are a few slightly awkward constructions (e.g., “Miren:” as an interjection, “partes de un contexto vacío”) and occasional over‑literal renderings, but overall it sounds like a native‑speaker conversation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑training → “preentrenamiento”, fine‑tuning → “afinamiento”, transfer learning → “aprendizaje por transferencia”, in‑context learning → “aprendizaje en contexto”, grounding → “anclaje”. The terminology is consistent throughout the text and appropriate for a non‑expert audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and explanatory style. Cultural references are adapted (e.g., “cajas negras”) and the dialogue retains its informal podcast feel. Minor stylistic improvements could be made, but the overall adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue. The ending punctuation is slightly missing but does not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and maintains the conversational tone of the podcast. Minor fluency and readability tweaks would bring it even closer to a native‑like version, but the work is essentially complete and reliable for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18/20.\n\nScore: 18"
