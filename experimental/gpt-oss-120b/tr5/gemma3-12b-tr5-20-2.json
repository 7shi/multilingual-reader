  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the sentences are easy to follow. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained clearly, and the podcast dialogue format is preserved. Minor punctuation quirks do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker. Vocabulary and idiomatic expressions are appropriate (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", \"una antisèche\" rendered as \"una guía rápida\"). A few redundancies (\"ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\") and slightly formal register are present, but overall the language is smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"grounding\", \"prompt\". The translator kept English terms in parentheses where useful, aiding understanding without over‑explaining.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The tone of a podcast discussion is preserved, and cultural references are neutral, fitting any Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor idiomatic tweaks could improve local flavor, but the intent and purpose are fully conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present. No sentences or concepts are omitted, and the translation does not add irrelevant material. The nuance of \"una antisèche\" is slightly softened but the meaning remains intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It faithfully reproduces the original content, uses appropriate technical vocabulary, and reads naturally for Spanish speakers. Small stylistic refinements could raise fluency a point or two, but the work is accurate, clear, and well‑adapted to the target audience.\nScore (out of 100): 92"
