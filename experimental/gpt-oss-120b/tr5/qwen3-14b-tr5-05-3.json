  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the podcast’s dialogue flows logically. Minor hiccups (e.g., occasional long sentences) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most of the text, but a few phrases are slightly awkward or literal (“La IA no está constantemente afinada por sus conversaciones”, “una hoja de respuestas”). These would be expressed differently by native speakers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding) is correctly rendered and consistently used. The only minor point is the mixed use of \"IA\" and \"modelo\" which is acceptable but could be unified.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and explanatory style. Cultural references are neutral, and the examples remain clear for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and nuances from the French script are present. No information is lost or incorrectly added.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical concepts clearly and keeps the conversational feel of the podcast. A few literal renderings slightly reduce fluency, but they do not affect understanding. The terminology is appropriate and the content is complete.\n\nTo reach a near‑perfect score, the translator could smooth out the few stiff constructions and maintain a consistent reference to the system (either \"IA\" or \"modelo\") throughout the dialogue.\n\nScore out of 20 points (average of the five criteria): 18"
