  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly logical and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor typographical errors (e.g., \"un único conversación\" instead of \"una única conversación\") and a few slightly clumsy phrases do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part and uses appropriate everyday vocabulary. There are occasional awkward constructions (\"una chuleta justo antes de que empiece a hablarles\", \"un único conversación\") and some literal translations that a native speaker might re‑phrase, but overall the flow is smooth.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". The choice of \"afinamiento\" for \"fine‑tuning\" is acceptable, though \"ajuste fino\" is more common. Consistency is maintained throughout the text.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast’s informal, conversational tone and adapts cultural references appropriately. The explanations are tailored to a Spanish‑speaking audience without losing the original intent. Minor idiomatic improvements could be made, but the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the structure mirrors the source. Small typographical slips do not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is very good. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the original’s conversational style, and is largely readable and natural for Spanish speakers. Minor grammatical slips and occasional literal renderings prevent it from being perfect, but they do not detract from understanding.\n\nStrengths: accurate terminology, faithful content transfer, good adaptation to the target audience. Areas for improvement: smooth out a few awkward phrasing choices and correct minor typographical errors.\n\nScore out of 20 (average of the five criteria): 17.\n\nOverall score: 17/20."
