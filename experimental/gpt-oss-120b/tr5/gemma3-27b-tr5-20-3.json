  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and conveys the ideas of the original French dialogue clearly. Sentences are mostly well‑structured, though a few very long sentences could be broken up for smoother reading. Overall, a Spanish‑speaking listener can understand the concepts without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places and uses appropriate everyday vocabulary. Minor awkwardness appears in literal renderings such as “una forma inteligente de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado” and the occasional retention of English terms in italics, but these do not break the flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”. The term *transfer learning* is left in English rather than being fully translated to “aprendizaje por transferencia”, and “grounding” is kept as *grounding* instead of a Spanish equivalent. Consistency is good overall, but the few untranslated terms lower the score slightly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references and maintains the informal podcast tone. Expressions like “consultor brillante” and “una antisèche” (rendered as “unos apuntes”) are well chosen for a Spanish audience. Small stylistic tweaks could improve readability, but the intent and register are preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is kept intact. Minor typographic differences (asterisks, italics) do not affect meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid, conveying the technical discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning clearly and accurately. Readability and completeness are strong, while fluency and terminology could be refined by translating the few remaining English technical words. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience.\nScore: 82/100 (average of the five criteria)."
