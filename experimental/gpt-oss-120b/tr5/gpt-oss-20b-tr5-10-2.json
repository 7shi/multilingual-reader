  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the dialogue flows naturally, making the technical discussion easy to follow. However, a few phrases are awkward, such as \"cramer para un examen\" (a mistranslation of \"bachoter\") and the occasional long sentences that could be split for better clarity. These minor issues slightly hinder smooth comprehension for readers unfamiliar with the topic.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation sounds natural to a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and the conversational tone is kept. There are a few grammatical slips (e.g., \"parten de un contexto vacío\" instead of \"parte de un contexto vacío\") and the odd word \"cramer\" that break fluency. Overall, the language is fluid but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje (grounding)\" are all correctly rendered and used consistently. The only notable lapse is the mistranslation of the colloquial \"bachoter\" as \"cramer\", which could confuse readers.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts the dialogue to a Spanish‑speaking audience, preserving the informal podcast style. Cultural references are neutral and appropriate. Minor oddities (the \"cramer\" term and the singular‑plural agreement error) slightly reduce the adaptation quality, but the overall message is well conveyed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No key points, examples, or analogies have been omitted, and the structure mirrors the source closely. The translation maintains the completeness of the content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and communicates the technical concepts clearly. It excels in preserving terminology and completeness, and generally adapts well to the target audience. A few lexical and grammatical errors (notably \"cramer\" and agreement mistakes) prevent it from reaching a perfect score, but these are relatively minor and do not obscure the meaning. With slight polishing, the text would be fully native‑like.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 86"
