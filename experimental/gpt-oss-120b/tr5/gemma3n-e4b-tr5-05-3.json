  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the ideas of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning in a way that a non‑expert listener can follow. Sentences are generally short and logical, and the podcast‑style dialogue is preserved. Minor typographical glitches (e.g., \"recién graduad ouniversitario\", \"artiñaña\") do not break comprehension, but they slightly distract.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads mostly naturally, using idiomatic Spanish (\"como contratar a un consultor brillante\", \"una memoria de un solo uso\"). However, there are a few awkward constructions and inconsistencies: mixed use of \"tus\"/\"vuestras\", the misspelled \"artiñaña\", and occasional literal translations (\"ventana de contexto\" is acceptable but less common than \"ventana de contexto\"). These issues prevent a perfect native‑speaker fluency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". The translator kept the English acronyms and provided Spanish equivalents, which is appropriate for the target audience. Consistency is maintained throughout the dialogue.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent, keeping the explanatory and conversational tone. Cultural references are neutral, and the examples (consultant, bicycle) are equally understandable in Spanish. Minor issues such as the typo \"artiñaña\" and the mixed second‑person forms slightly reduce the adaptation quality.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No essential content is omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as the original. Redundancy is not introduced, and the length matches the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and faithful to the original podcast script. It successfully transmits complex AI concepts in an accessible way and preserves the dialogue’s flow. The main drawbacks are a handful of typographical errors, slight inconsistencies in pronoun usage, and one misspelling (\"artiñaña\" instead of \"artimaña\"). With a quick proofreading pass these minor issues could be fixed, bringing the translation very close to a native‑level, professional quality.\n\n**Final score (out of 100)**: 91/100"
