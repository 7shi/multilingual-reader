    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are clear. Minor hiccups such as the occasional missing period or the use of the French word *antisèche* do not significantly hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and the conversational tone of a podcast is preserved. A few expressions feel slightly foreign (e.g., *una antisèche* instead of a Spanish equivalent, the switch from ICL to AIC, and occasional literal renderings) which create brief moments of awkwardness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *transferencia de aprendizaje*, *ventana de contexto*, *grounding* → *anclaje*, etc. Consistency is maintained throughout. The only small drawback is the change of the abbreviation ICL to AIC, which is not the standard Spanish usage and could confuse readers familiar with the original term.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator successfully adapts the original French‑French‑Canadian podcast style to a Spanish‑speaking audience, preserving the informal banter and the consultant‑vs‑expert analogy. Cultural references are kept neutral, which works well. Retaining the French loanword *antisèche* is a missed opportunity for a smoother cultural fit (e.g., *chuleta*).",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the source script is present. No ideas or details are omitted, and the logical flow of the discussion is maintained. Minor typographic variations (e.g., “pre‑entrenamiento” vs. “preentrenamiento”) do not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, retains the lively podcast tone, and is largely readable and natural for Spanish speakers. Small issues—such as the occasional foreign‑language loanword, the non‑standard abbreviation change, and a few slightly stiff phrases—prevent a perfect score but do not detract from the overall effectiveness of the translation.\n\n**Total score:** 88/100 (average of the five criteria). The work is commendable and would only need minor polishing to reach an excellent level.\n\n**Strengths:** clear explanations of complex AI concepts, consistent terminology, faithful content transfer.\n**Areas for improvement:** replace French loanwords with Spanish equivalents, keep standard abbreviations (ICL), smooth out the few literal phrasings.\n\nThis translation would be well‑understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI and podcast formats."
