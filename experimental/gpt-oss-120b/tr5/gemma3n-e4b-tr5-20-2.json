    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable; the main ideas and analogies are conveyed. However, typographical errors (e.g., “¡Bonnjour”, “pre‑entrerenamiento”, “artiña”), occasional mismatched pronouns (tus/vuestras) and a few awkward phrases (e.g., “cha chatbots”, “una forma astucia”) interrupt the flow and may momentarily confuse the reader.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural but is marred by several non‑native constructions and spelling mistakes. Expressions such as “una forma astucia de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado” or “¿Entonces, es una artiña?” are ungrammatical or odd in Spanish. These issues reduce the overall smoothness.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is generally well handled: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “anclaje”, “prompt”. The acronyms are kept, and the key concepts are preserved. Minor inconsistencies (e.g., “Transformeers”) do not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator kept the original intent, tone and analogies (consultant vs. expert, studying for an exam, etc.). Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Nevertheless, the few errors noted above and some literal translations (e.g., “¡Bonnjour”) slightly detract from a fully adapted text.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the “memory” feature. No substantive information is omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation succeeds in delivering the technical content and maintains the conversational style of the podcast. The main weaknesses are typographical and grammatical slip‑ups that affect readability and naturalness. With careful proofreading and correction of the highlighted errors, the translation would reach a high level of quality suitable for a native Spanish‑speaking audience."
