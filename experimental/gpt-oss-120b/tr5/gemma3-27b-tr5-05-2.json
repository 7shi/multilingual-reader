  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are presented in a logical order that a Spanish‑speaking audience can grasp without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", \"memoria a corto plazo\"). A few passages are slightly literal – for instance, keeping the French word *ancrage* in parentheses instead of using a Spanish equivalent such as \"anclaje\" – but this does not break the flow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (aprendizaje en contexto)\". The only minor lapse is the untranslated French term *ancrage*, which could have been rendered as \"anclaje\" or \"fundamentación\". Otherwise, terminology is precise and suitable for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French podcast tone to Spanish without losing intent. Cultural references are neutral, and the conversational style (e.g., “¿Necesito un consultor temporal o un experto permanente?”) feels natural for Spanish listeners. Minor lexical choices could be refined, but the overall adaptation is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the source script is preserved. No key idea, example, or nuance is omitted, and the translation does not introduce redundant or unrelated content. The structure mirrors the original, ensuring the listener receives the full message.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation from French to Spanish is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains a clear and engaging narrative, and is largely fluent and natural. The only notable issues are a couple of literal renderings and the retention of a French term (*ancrage*) that could be fully localized. These are minor and do not detract significantly from comprehension or professionalism.\nOverall score: 91/100.\n\nThe work demonstrates solid linguistic competence and good handling of specialized terminology, making it suitable for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nRecommendations: replace *ancrage* with a Spanish equivalent and review a few literal constructions for smoother idiomatic flow.\n\nScore out of 100: 91"
