  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the logical flow of the original French dialogue. Most sentences are clear, and the main ideas are conveyed. However, occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., “Imaginad que enviamos…”, “la expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo”) and some misplaced quotation marks interrupt smooth reading. The mixture of formal and informal registers (using “Imaginad” vs. “tú”) also slightly reduces consistency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnaturally literal renderings and punctuation errors. Phrases such as “El pre‑entrenamiento becomes El pre‑entrenamiento” or “Camille: \"Es decir\" \"¿O sea?\" \"Quiero decir\"” are clearly remnants of the source formatting and sound odd to native speakers. Overall, the language is passable but not fully natural or idiomatic.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “grounding”. The translator sometimes adds clarifying parentheses, which helps comprehension. A few nuances (e.g., “expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo”) are not perfectly aligned with standard Spanish AI terminology, but the overall terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast conversation. Cultural references are minimal, so no major adaptation is required. Nonetheless, the mix of formal/informal address and the literal preservation of English‑style quotation marks can feel out‑of‑place for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor adjustments could improve cultural resonance.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All core information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the examples (English‑French transfer, consultant analogy) are kept. The only loss is some of the meta‑commentary that appears as stray English tags, which does not affect the factual content but adds clutter.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in transmitting the technical content and overall structure of the original podcast, but it suffers from a few literal artifacts, inconsistent register, and occasional awkward phrasing. Technical terminology is well‑handled, and the essential information is intact. With a smoother, more idiomatic revision and cleaning of residual formatting marks, the text would reach a higher level of naturalness and readability for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\nOverall Score (sum of the five criteria): 80/100."
