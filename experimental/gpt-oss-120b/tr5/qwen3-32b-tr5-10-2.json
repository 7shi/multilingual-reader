  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the logical flow of the original dialogue is preserved. Minor issues such as an isolated line \"El pre‑entrenamiento.\" and occasional long sentences slightly reduce smoothness, but overall a native reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are a few awkward or literal renderings: the stand‑alone \"El pre‑entrenamiento.\" feels odd, the acronym mismatch \"AIC (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\" is confusing, and the French term \"antisèche\" is left untranslated. These glitches prevent the text from being completely fluent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\", etc. The main inconsistency is the mistaken acronym \"AIC\" instead of ICL and the retention of the French word \"antisèche\". Otherwise the term choices are appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone of a podcast conversation. Cultural adaptation is adequate, but the untranslated French slang \"antisèche\" and the literal rendering of some explanatory passages slightly detract from full adaptation to Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the ideas, examples, and nuances from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary content. Minor redundancy with repeated explanations of ICL is harmless.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. Readability and completeness are strong, while fluency and terminology suffer from a handful of literal choices and minor inconsistencies (e.g., the stray French term and the wrong acronym). With a few revisions—especially fixing \"antisèche\", correcting the acronym, and smoothing isolated fragments—the text would reach a near‑native level of quality.\nScore: 83/100 (average 16.6/20)."
