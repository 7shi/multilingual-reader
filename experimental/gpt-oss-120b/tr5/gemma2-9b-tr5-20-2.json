    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the logical flow of the dialogue is preserved. Most sentences are easy to follow, and complex concepts are explained with suitable analogies. Minor issues such as the typo “Parce que” (should be “Porque”) and occasional punctuation errors slightly affect smooth reading, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward or overly literal constructions: “Mira usted”, “El afianzamiento” for “fine‑tuning”, and the mixed use of formal and informal registers. These moments make the text feel a bit stilted to a native speaker, though the overall meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled. Core concepts such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino” (although later rendered as “afianzamiento”), “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “ventana contextual”, and “anclado” are correctly translated and consistently used. The occasional alternative wording does not create confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast discussion. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogies (consultant, examen vs dominio) work in Spanish. Slightly formal phrasing (“Mira usted”) reflects a literal transfer from French, but it does not hinder the message.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French source is retained: the stages of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs permanent knowledge distinction, and the explanation of “memoria” features. No significant content is omitted, and redundancies are minimal.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the technical content accurately and maintains the conversational structure of the podcast. While readability and completeness are strong, fluency suffers from a few literal and formal‑register choices that make the text feel slightly unnatural. Technical terminology is well‑managed, and the adaptation respects the original intent. With minor stylistic adjustments, the translation would reach a near‑native level of polish.\nTotal Score: 85/100."
