    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure, but several literal translations (e.g., “cascos negros” instead of the idiomatic “cajas negras”) and isolated fragments like “El afinado.” disrupt the flow. Long sentences are still clear, but occasional awkward phrasing makes reading slightly effortful.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are many non‑native constructions: “revelan cómo funcionan”, “cascos negros”, “El afinado.”, “morfos”, and the erroneous phrase “Capa de Cachado de Inferencia”. These make the dialogue sound stilted and sometimes confusing, reducing naturalness.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms (preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding, afinamiento) are mostly correctly rendered. However, the mistranslation “Capa de Cachado de Inferencia” and occasional retention of English words like “prompt” show inconsistency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the podcast tone but fails to fully adapt idioms and cultural references to Spanish. Literal renderings and odd word choices (e.g., “cascos negros”) limit the cultural resonance, though the overall intent is preserved.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French script are present; no significant content is omitted. Minor deviations (e.g., the misnamed ICL layer) do not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original message and retains most of the technical content, but it suffers from literalness and several awkward or incorrect expressions that affect readability and fluency. Technical terminology is mostly accurate, though a key term is mistranslated. With better idiomatic adaptation and correction of the few errors, the quality would rise substantially. Overall, the translation is functional but needs polishing to feel natural to a native Spanish audience."
