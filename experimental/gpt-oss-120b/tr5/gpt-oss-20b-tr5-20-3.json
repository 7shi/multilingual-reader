  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow. Sentences are short and the flow mirrors the original dialogue, making the concepts accessible. Minor issues such as repeated speaker tags (e.g., “Camille :”) and occasional punctuation quirks do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, using idiomatic Spanish (“bachotaje”, “hoja de trucos”). A few constructions feel slightly stiff or literal (“Imaginen que enviamos una IA totalmente nueva a la escuela”), but overall a native speaker would find it fluid.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “grounding” and “prompt” are correctly rendered or left in English where appropriate. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast conversation. Cultural references are neutral, and the examples (consultant, student) are adapted naturally to Spanish without loss of meaning.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points, examples, and nuances from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is omitted, and the dialogue structure is kept intact.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content clearly, uses appropriate terminology, and reads naturally for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Minor stylistic tweaks (removing redundant speaker tags, smoothing a few literal renderings) would bring it closer to perfection, but the current version is fully functional and faithful to the source.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
