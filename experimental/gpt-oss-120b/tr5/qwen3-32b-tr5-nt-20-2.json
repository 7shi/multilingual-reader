  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow; sentences are mostly short and logical. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained clearly. Minor hiccups (e.g., “Se puede tener una conversación larga y detallada” could be smoother) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. A few expressions feel slightly literal (“Es una observación excelente” instead of a more common “Es una observación muy acertada”), but overall the flow is smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, ventana de contexto, grounding (anclaje). The decision to keep “fine‑tuning” in English reflects common usage in Spanish tech circles, and the translation is consistent throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original podcast are preserved. Cultural references are neutral, and the translation adapts idioms (e.g., “consultor temporal” vs. “temporary consultant”) suitably for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is retained. No sentences are omitted, and no extraneous material is added. The meaning of each paragraph is preserved accurately.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content clearly, uses appropriate terminology, and reads naturally for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic tweaks could raise fluency a point or two, but the work is solid and faithful to the source.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 18, Fluency 17, Terminology 19, Contextual Adaptation 18, Information Completeness 20. The average yields an overall rating of 18/20.\n\nStrengths: clear explanations, consistent terminology, complete information transfer.\nWeaknesses: occasional literal phrasing that slightly reduces naturalness.\n\nRecommendation: a light proof‑read for idiomatic polish would bring the fluency to near‑perfect levels.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18/20."
