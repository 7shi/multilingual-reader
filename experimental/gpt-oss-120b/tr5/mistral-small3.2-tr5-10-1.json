  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento and aprendizaje en contexto are explained clearly. A few sentences are slightly abrupt (e.g., “El pre‑entrenamiento.” as a standalone line) but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several minor awkward constructions: “partes de un contexto vacío” (should be “empiezas”), “La totalidad del historial de su discusión … constituye el contexto” (agreement issue), and occasional missing articles (“aprendizaje en contexto en acción”). The use of colloquial words like “chuleta” and “empollar” is appropriate, yet the overall flow could be smoother.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is consistently and accurately rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding, etc. The translator kept the English term “grounding” in parentheses, which is acceptable for a technical audience. No critical term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original tone to a Spanish‑speaking audience well. Cultural‑specific expressions such as “chuleta” for cheat‑sheet and “empollar” for cramming are apt. The intent of the dialogue (explanatory, conversational) is preserved, and the examples remain relevant.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No sentences or ideas are omitted, and the nuances (e.g., the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge) are maintained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and faithful to the original. It conveys the technical content clearly and adapts well to Spanish‑speaking listeners, though a few grammatical slips and slightly stiff phrasing keep it from being perfectly fluent. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a podcast script.\n\nScore breakdown: 18 (readability) + 16 (fluency) + 19 (terminology) + 18 (contextual adaptation) + 20 (information completeness) = **91 / 100**.\n\nPotential improvements: smooth out the few awkward sentences, ensure subject‑verb agreement, and add missing articles where needed to reach native‑level fluency.\n\nOverall rating: 91/100."
