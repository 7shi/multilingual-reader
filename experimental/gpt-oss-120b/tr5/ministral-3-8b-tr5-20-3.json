    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the same ideas and is generally easy to follow. Most sentences are clear and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a Spanish‑speaking audience can understand. A few grammatical slips (e.g., \"La IA no se afinan…\") and the occasional long sentence slightly hinder smooth reading, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally, but there are several awkward or outright incorrect constructions: \"La IA no se afinan constantemente\" (agreement error), the mixed French‑Spanish phrase \"Ce sería incroyablement inefficace\", and some clumsy phrasing such as \"hablar con usted\" in a podcast context. These errors make the text feel less polished for a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled consistently and appropriately: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", etc. The translator kept the specialized terms and even added helpful clarifications where needed. No major mistranslations of key terms were observed.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the content to Spanish‑speaking listeners, using familiar expressions (e.g., \"bachotear\", \"consultor brillante\"). Cultural references are preserved, and the tone remains podcast‑like. The only drawback is the lingering French fragment, which breaks the cultural adaptation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present. No significant information is omitted, and the added sentence about the pre‑entrenamiento being a fundamental topic does not distort the meaning. The mixed‑language fragment could cause minor confusion, but the factual content remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation succeeds in delivering the original message and technical content to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Terminology is accurate and the structure mirrors the source well. However, a handful of grammatical errors and a noticeable French‑Spanish mix reduce the fluency and polish of the final text. A light proofreading pass to fix agreement mistakes and eliminate the foreign‑language fragment would bring the translation to a higher quality level."
