  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow; sentences are generally short and logical. Complex AI concepts are explained clearly with analogies that work in Spanish. Minor issues such as isolated fragments (e.g., “El pre‑entrenamiento.”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but a few expressions feel slightly awkward for a native speaker: “El aprendizaje en contexto, es como bachatear” (the comma is unnecessary and “bachatear” is not the most common verb, “bachotear” would be preferred), and occasional literal constructions (“el concepto de \"grounding\" (ancaje)”). These quirks lower fluency marginally.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding (ancaje). The choices are appropriate for the intended audience and match standard Spanish usage in AI literature.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts cultural references (e.g., “consultor brillante”, “carrera universitaria”) well for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only slight mismatch is the use of “bachatear”, which is colloquial but still understandable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present. No content is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The key distinctions between fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are fully retained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is very good: it conveys the technical content accurately and maintains the conversational tone of the podcast. Minor fluency hiccups (some unnatural phrasing and a few punctuation choices) prevent a perfect score, but the overall readability, terminology handling, and completeness are strong.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
