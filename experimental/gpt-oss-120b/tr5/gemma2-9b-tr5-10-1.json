  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are conveyed in a logical order. Most sentences are clear, and the complex concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. However, a few typographical errors (e.g., \"cramar\") and occasional awkward phrasing slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several non‑native constructions: missing accent in \"Pense\" (should be \"Piense\"), the odd verb \"cramar\" (does not exist in Spanish), and the use of \"afianzamiento\" for fine‑tuning, which feels forced. Some sentences are overly literal, such as \"Pense en esto\" instead of \"Piense en esto\". These issues make the text sound less natural to a native speaker, although the majority of the wording is correct and understandable.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are appropriate. The major problem is the translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"afianzamiento\", which is not the standard term (\"ajuste fino\" or \"fine‑tuning\" would be expected). This could confuse readers familiar with the literature. Apart from that, the rest of the terminology is consistent.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French context well for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogy of a consultant, university graduate, and bicycle are kept intact and make sense in Spanish. Minor issues such as the literal translation of \"grounding\" to \"anclado\" are acceptable. Overall the intent and tone of the podcast are preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the main points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted, and the sequence of ideas mirrors the original. The only loss is the nuance caused by the typo \"cramar\" which could mislead the reader about the meaning of \"bachotage\". Still, the factual content remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of conveying the original podcast script, preserving the structure and the educational tone. The main shortcomings are a few grammatical slips, an incorrect technical term for fine‑tuning, and a non‑existent verb \"cramar\" that distracts the reader. With minor revisions—correcting the typo, using the proper term \"ajuste fino\", and fixing the accent errors—the translation would be fluent, accurate, and fully natural for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\nOverall, the work is competent but needs polishing to reach native‑level quality.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
