  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the original logical flow. However, several grammatical slips (e.g., \"rep aprender\", \"Las conocimientos\") and occasional awkward phrasing make it slightly harder for a native reader to read smoothly.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are multiple unnatural expressions such as \"Hola y bienvenido en\", \"Gracias por haber escuchado a nosotros\" and the unnecessary bullet‑list inside the dialogue. These break the natural rhythm of a spoken podcast. Vocabulary is mostly appropriate, but the syntax errors reduce overall fluency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms (preentrenamiento, ventana de contexto, ICL, aprendizaje por transferencia) are correctly rendered. The translation of \"affinage\" as \"afinamiento\" is acceptable, though \"ajuste fino\" would be more common. The inserted explanatory note about vocabulaire is not present in the source and adds noise, but it does not distort the core terminology.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly respects the original intent, but cultural‑linguistic adaptation is uneven. Phrases like \"Hola y bienvenido en\" are unidiomatic, and the sudden inclusion of a bullet list about \"Vocabulario clave\" is out of place for a podcast script. These issues lower the adaptation quality.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory vs. permanent knowledge, and the \"memory\" feature. No essential information is omitted, though the extra bullet list adds redundant material.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main concepts of the podcast and retains most of the technical content, but it suffers from noticeable grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and an intrusive explanatory insert that does not belong to the original. A careful copy‑editing pass would be needed to bring the text to a native‑speaker level of fluency and readability.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14/20."
