    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the flow of ideas mirrors the original French script. Most sentences convey the concepts clearly, and the technical explanations are understandable for a non‑expert audience. Minor issues affect readability: a few incomplete sentences (e.g., “El afinado.”) and occasional abrupt transitions that require the reader to re‑parse the meaning.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward constructions and inconsistencies. Examples include “El afinado. Es como enviar…”, mixed use of “tus” and “vuestras”, and the unnecessary insertion “Es, entonces, un método efectivo para optimizar el aprendizaje de modelos.” These elements make the text feel slightly stilted for a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento” (fine‑tuning), “entrenamiento por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and “grounding” are all correctly rendered and used consistently. The only slight drawback is the use of “afinado” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”, but the meaning is preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original content to Spanish‑speaking listeners effectively, using appropriate analogies and culturally neutral language. However, the podcast name switches from «Tech Flash» at the start to «Tech Éclair» at the end, which can confuse the audience. The mix of “tus” and “vuestras” also hints at inconsistent regional adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French version are present: pre‑training, transfer learning, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent knowledge distinction, and the explanation of “memory” features. Minor deviations include the added sentence about “optimizar el aprendizaje de modelos” that does not exist in the source, and a few small nuances that are slightly paraphrased, but no essential information is lost.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation conveys the technical content accurately and is largely understandable for Spanish listeners. Strengths lie in the correct handling of specialized terminology and the faithful transmission of the original structure. The main weaknesses are occasional unnatural phrasing, minor inconsistencies (podcast name, pronoun usage), and a small extraneous sentence that slightly deviates from the source. With a few editorial tweaks the translation would reach a higher level of polish and fluency."
