  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can grasp. However, there are formatting artefacts (e.g., stray **, duplicated speaker tags) that interrupt the flow and require the reader to mentally filter them out, which slightly reduces readability.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part; idiomatic expressions like \"empollarse\" are well chosen. A few constructions feel literal (e.g., \"prompt\" is left in English, \"como un recién graduado universitario:\"), and the residual markup (*, **, etc.) creates minor awkwardness. Overall, a native speaker would understand without difficulty, but the text is not perfectly smooth.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\". Some terms remain in English (\"prompt\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"grounding\") without explanation, which could confuse readers unfamiliar with the original jargon. Consistency is good otherwise.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast tone and intent. Cultural references are adapted (e.g., \"empollarse\"), and the explanation of analogies is clear for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only drawback is the leftover formatting markers that distract from the content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the logical progression of the discussion is maintained. Minor typographic glitches do not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the technical content effectively. It reads well and adapts the original conversational style to Spanish, using appropriate idioms. The primary issues are residual formatting artefacts and a few untranslated technical words that could be clarified for a broader audience. Fixing these would bring the translation close to a perfect score.\n\n**Total score:** 85/100 (average of the five criteria)."
