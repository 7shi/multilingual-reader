  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall easy to follow. Sentences are generally short and the concepts are explained clearly. A few minor hiccups (e.g., “Camille: El preentrenamiento. Es un proceso” adds an unnecessary fragment, and “¿Porque” lacks the proper interrogative accent) slightly disrupt the flow, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part and uses appropriate colloquial register for a podcast. Some expressions feel a bit forced or redundant – “las informaciones” (plural) is unusual, and the informal word “chuleta” may feel too slang‑y for a technical discussion. The missing label on Luc’s bike‑analogy line is a tiny formatting slip. Overall the language is smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well handled: preentrenamiento, afinamiento (ajuste fino), aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, anclaje, etc. The translator kept the terminology consistent and provided the parenthetical English acronym where appropriate. No major mistranslations of technical concepts were found.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, adapting cultural references correctly. The only slight issue is the use of “chuleta”, a colloquial Latin‑American term that may not match the podcast’s formal‑educational style. Otherwise, the adaptation is spot‑on.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present. No major ideas are omitted. The added phrase “Es un proceso” after “El preentrenamiento” is an extra that does not alter meaning, and the rest of the content is faithful to the source.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, conveying the technical discussion clearly and accurately. Minor grammatical slips, a slightly informal word choice, and a small formatting inconsistency prevent it from being perfect, but they do not significantly affect the listener’s understanding. The translator demonstrates strong command of both languages and the subject matter."
