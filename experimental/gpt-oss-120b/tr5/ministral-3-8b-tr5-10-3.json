  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally clear and the dialogue flows logically. Most sentences are easy to understand, and complex concepts such as transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in an accessible way. However, there are a few grammatical slips (e.g., “punto crucial que suele malentendido”) that may cause a momentary pause for the reader.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text mostly sounds natural to a native Spanish speaker, using appropriate colloquial expressions (“es como contratar a un consultor brillante”). Nonetheless, some awkward phrasing and the accidental inclusion of French words (\"requête\", \"insère\", \"coulisses\") break the fluency and feel out of place.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\" are all correctly rendered. Consistency is maintained throughout. Minor issues such as using \"informaciones\" instead of the more common \"información\" do not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural references are neutral, and the speaker style is kept intact. Small additions (parenthetical clarification) do not distort the message, and the overall adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience is successful.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present; no major ideas are omitted. The only drawbacks are minor linguistic errors, not loss of content. The translation remains faithful to the original script.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and in a way that Spanish listeners can follow. The main weaknesses are occasional grammatical mistakes and the unintended mix of French terms in one paragraph, which detract from fluency. Apart from those issues, terminology and content fidelity are strong, making the translation quite effective for its intended audience.\n\n**Overall score (average): 17/20**"
