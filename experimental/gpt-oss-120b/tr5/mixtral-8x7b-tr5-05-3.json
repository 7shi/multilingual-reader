  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish output is fragmented, contains many parenthetical notes, literal translations of meta‑instructions, and random English sentences. The flow is broken; readers would have to constantly re‑parse what is dialogue versus translation notes. Consequently comprehension is severely impaired.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Numerous sentences are ungrammatical or sound like literal word‑for‑word conversions (e.g., \"¡Buenos días! In this lesson, we'll learn…\", \"approachedebatiendo\", \"affinage\" left untranslated). The use of capitalisation, punctuation, and verb forms is inconsistent, making the text sound unnatural to native Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as «pré‑entraînement», «fine‑tuning», «transfer learning», «in‑context learning», «fenêtre de contexte», and «mémoire à court terme» are sometimes rendered correctly, but often appear as raw French terms, English glosses, or incorrect Spanish equivalents. The inconsistency hampers precise technical understanding.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to adapt cultural or linguistic nuances. It includes literal French expressions, untranslated French words, and irrelevant instructional notes that would not appear in a natural Spanish podcast script. The intent of the original conversational style is largely lost.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "While many of the original ideas are present in some form, large portions are omitted, altered, or replaced by meta‑comments (e.g., explanations of translation tasks, unrelated language‑learning examples). Important distinctions—such as the difference between temporary in‑context knowledge and permanent fine‑tuned knowledge—are muddled or missing.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is far from a usable Spanish version of the French podcast script. It mixes the target text with translation instructions, unrelated language‑learning excerpts, and numerous literal, unedited fragments. Readability, fluency, terminology handling, and completeness are all severely compromised. A complete, clean rewrite by a qualified bilingual translator is required to produce a coherent, natural, and technically accurate Spanish version."
