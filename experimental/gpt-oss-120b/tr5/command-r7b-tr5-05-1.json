  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the original dialogue structure, but there are several hiccups that hinder smooth reading: the French word *Précisément* is left untranslated, speaker tags are duplicated (e.g., “Luc: Luc:” ), and some sentences are oddly punctuated. Minor grammar slips (missing subjects, wrong verb forms) force the reader to pause, lowering overall comprehensibility.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural phrasings and grammatical errors that a native speaker would not produce: *El afinar* instead of *el afinado*, missing articles, awkward word order (“él no necesita volver a aprender qué es un verbo”), and inconsistent use of masculine/feminine forms. These issues make the text feel stilted despite the generally correct vocabulary.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, grounding). The terminology is consistent throughout and appropriate for a non‑specialist audience. The only drawback is the occasional retention of French words, but this does not significantly affect technical accuracy.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The informal podcast tone is preserved and the cultural references are suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, the occasional leftover French interjections and the slightly altered wording in the section about the new approach (extra explanatory sentence) slightly diverge from the original intent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs permanent nature of knowledge, and the “memory” feature. No critical information is omitted, though a few sentences are expanded unnecessarily, which does not harm completeness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core concepts of the podcast and uses appropriate technical vocabulary, but it suffers from several linguistic slips that affect readability and naturalness. Cleaning up the leftover French words, correcting grammar, and smoothing awkward phrasing would raise the quality considerably. As it stands, the translation is functional but not polished."
