    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "No source or target text was provided, so I cannot assess how easily a Spanish‑speaking reader would understand the content. I would need to see the translation to judge sentence structure, clarity, and logical flow.",

      "reasoning": "Without the translated Spanish text I cannot determine whether the language sounds natural, whether there are awkward constructions, or if the vocabulary is appropriate for native speakers.",

    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology can only be evaluated when the specific terms used in the translation are visible. I need the French source and its Spanish rendering to check consistency and adequacy.",

      "reasoning": "Assessing omission, redundancy, or the presence of supplemental explanations requires the content of both the source and the translation, which are missing.",

    "overall_comment": "I am unable to evaluate the translation because the French source text and its Spanish translation were not included in your request. Please provide both the original French passage and the corresponding Spanish translation, and I will gladly perform a detailed assessment using the requested criteria and scoring system."
