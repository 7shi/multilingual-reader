  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the concepts are explained clearly. Sentences are generally well‑structured, and the audience can follow the discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning without difficulty. A few very long sentences could be split for easier reading, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, but there are occasional awkward phrases (e.g., “Miren:” as a stand‑alone interjection, mixed use of “sus” and “vuestras”, and the term “afinado” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”). These minor slips prevent the text from feeling completely native‑like.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled appropriately: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"grounding\" rendered as \"anclaje\" are all accurate. Consistency is mostly kept, although \"afinado\" could be replaced by the more standard \"ajuste fino\". Overall the terminology is precise and suitable for the intended audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the podcast tone and adapts the content to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Cultural references are neutral, and the intent of the original is preserved. The only drawback is the inconsistent level of formality (mix of \"sus\" and \"vuestras\"), which slightly disrupts the informal podcast vibe.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No key ideas are omitted, and no superfluous material is added. The translation maintains the same level of detail and examples.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the technical content well. Readability and terminology are strong, and the information is complete. Fluency suffers from a few unnatural expressions and inconsistent pronoun usage, and the term \"afinado\" could be replaced with the more common \"ajuste fino\". With minor polishing, the text would read as a fully native‑like podcast script.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17.6/20."
