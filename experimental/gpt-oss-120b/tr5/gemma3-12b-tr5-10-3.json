  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can understand. A few very literal translations slightly increase cognitive load, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural for native speakers overall. Most idiomatic expressions are appropriate (\"una analogía perfecta\", \"da la impresión de que\"). There are a few clunky phrases that betray the French source, such as \"una gran aproximación más flexible está surgiendo\" (better: \"un enfoque más flexible está emergiendo\") and the occasional retention of English words (\"prompt\"). Nevertheless, the flow remains smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are all correctly rendered. The term \"grounding\" is translated as \"ancaje\" and kept consistent. The only minor issue is the untranslated \"prompt\", which could have been rendered as \"entrada\" or \"instrucción\" for full Spanish consistency.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the podcast format and adapts cultural references appropriately. Spanish‑speaking listeners will find the analogies and examples familiar. The tone remains conversational and engaging, matching the original intent. Minor literal traces of French syntax remain, but they do not affect the overall adaptation.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present. No sections are omitted, and no additional, unnecessary material is inserted. Even the formatting nuances (asterisks around *prompt*) are retained, preserving the original meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation from French to Spanish is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains a clear and engaging style, and adapts well to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor phrasing issues and the occasional English term prevent a perfect score, but they do not detract significantly from comprehension or fluency. Overall, it is an excellent rendering suitable for a podcast transcript.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 91/100"
