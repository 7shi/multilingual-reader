  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall clear and easy to follow. The sentences convey the concepts without excessive complexity, and the podcast style is maintained. Minor typographical issues (e.g., missing accent in \"Ahi\", and a redundant list of possible translations for \"C'est‑à‑dire\") slightly affect smoothness, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, using appropriate colloquial language (e.g., \"consultor brillante\"). However, there are a few grammatical slips such as \"se inserta estos fragmentos\" (should be \"se insertan\"), missing accent marks, and occasional literal constructions that feel slightly stilted. These errors prevent a perfect fluency rating.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". The terminology is consistent throughout and matches the level expected for a general‑audience tech podcast.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and humor. It adapts the examples to Spanish naturally (e.g., \"consultor brillante\"). The only slight deviation is the insertion of three alternative questions for \"C’est‑à‑dire?\", which adds redundancy but does not distort meaning. Cultural references remain appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the added clarifications do not alter the original message. The content is concise and faithful.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical discussion clearly, uses suitable terminology, and maintains the conversational podcast style. Minor typographical and grammatical issues keep it just shy of perfection, but the meaning and nuance are fully preserved. The translator demonstrated solid understanding of both languages and the subject matter, delivering a readable and accurate Spanish version of the original French script."
