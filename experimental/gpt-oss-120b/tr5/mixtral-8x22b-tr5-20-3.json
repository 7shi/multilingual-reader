    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the logical flow of the original dialogue. Most sentences convey the concepts clearly, and the technical explanations are retained. However, there are a few distracting artifacts (e.g., the stray “Translation:” tag) and a mix of formal / informal pronouns that can momentarily confuse the reader. Overall, a native speaker can follow the conversation without major effort.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally, but several expressions feel slightly awkward or literal: \"ligar las respuestas\", \"consultor brillante\", the inconsistent use of \"usted\" and \"tú\", and the leftover English acronym “AIC”. These hiccups break the smoothness expected in a spoken‑podcast script. Nevertheless, the majority of the sentences are fluent and sound like a native speaker would say them.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly (preentrenamiento, afinamiento, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto). The main error is the introduction of the acronym “AIC” instead of keeping the original “ICL”, which could confuse readers familiar with the literature. Apart from that, the translation keeps the specialized vocabulary consistent.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and purpose of the original are well preserved, and the examples (consultant analogy, memory feature) are adapted appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The mixed register (formal / informal) slightly weakens cultural adaptation, and the stray “Translation:” line shows a lack of final editing, but overall the context is conveyed effectively.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are present in the Spanish version: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the description of “memory” features. No major content is omitted, and the explanations are complete, albeit with minor redundancy and the extraneous tag.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the substance of the original podcast and is largely clear and accurate. It would benefit from a careful proofread to remove leftover editorial tags, correct the acronym, and standardize the register. After these edits, the text would be smooth, fully natural, and ready for a Spanish‑language audience.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
