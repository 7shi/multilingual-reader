    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas, and complex concepts are explained in plain language. However, there are a few noticeable issues that hurt readability: the French phrase \"Parce que\" is left untranslated, and some sentences are slightly clunky (e.g., \"Es una memoria de uso único\" could be smoother). These minor glitches prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds fairly natural for a native speaker, but occasional awkward phrasing and inconsistent word choices break the flow. Examples include the mixed‑language segment \"Parce que ya comprende\", the use of \"afianzamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\", and the literal \"se le ha dado una pista justo antes de que comenzara a hablar contigo\". Such spots make the text feel less polished.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely preserved (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana contextual, ICL). Nevertheless, the translation switches between \"ajuste fino\" and \"afianzamiento\" for the same concept, which can confuse readers. The term \"anclado\" is acceptable but less common than \"anclaje\". Overall the terminology is appropriate but not consistently applied.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator keeps the original intent, tone, and educational purpose intact. Cultural references are suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience, and the examples (consultor, bicicleta) work well. The only drawback is the leftover French word, which slightly disrupts the adaptation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive ideas are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue. Minor redundancies are absent, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. Readability and fluency are good, though occasional untranslated fragments and inconsistent terminology prevent a higher rating. With a quick cleanup of the few linguistic slips (especially removing the French \"Parce que\" and standardising the term for fine‑tuning), the text would read as a very natural, professional Spanish podcast transcript."
