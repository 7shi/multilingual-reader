  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clearly expressed. The flow of the dialogue is preserved, and complex concepts are explained with simple analogies. Minor issues such as stray quotation marks and occasional overly literal phrasing do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward constructions (e.g., “en la sugerencia”, “el modelo en sí no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus conversaciones”) and inconsistent use of quotation marks. Some English terms like “prompt” are left untranslated, which is acceptable in a technical context but slightly reduces fluency for a general audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, anclaje, etc., are all correctly rendered and used consistently. A few terms remain in English (prompt, grounding) but this is typical in Spanish tech discourse.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast conversation. Cultural adaptation is adequate, though some literal translations (e.g., “consultor brillante”) could be phrased more idiomatically. Overall the target audience receives the same message.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is retained. No substantive content is omitted, and the examples and analogies are preserved. The occasional extra quotation marks are artifacts of formatting rather than loss of meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. Readability and completeness are strong points, while fluency and cultural nuance could be refined slightly. Technical terms are consistently translated, making it suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nOverall, the work demonstrates a good command of both languages, with room for minor polishing to reach native‑level fluidity.\n\nScore breakdown: 18 + 16 + 17 + 15 + 19 = **85/100** out of a possible 100 points (5 × 20). The translation is of high quality and only needs slight stylistic adjustments.\n\n---\n**Scoring summary**\n- Readability: 18/20\n- Fluency: 16/20\n- Terminology: 17/20\n- Contextual Adaptation: 15/20\n- Information Completeness: 19/20\n- **Total: 85/100**"
