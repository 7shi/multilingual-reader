  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the flow of ideas is preserved. However, there are a few awkward repetitions (e.g., the duplicated line about pre‑entrenamiento) and some sentences are overly literal, which can momentarily confuse the reader.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally, but several French words remain untranslated (\"requête\", \"coulisses\"), and some phrasing sounds literal rather than idiomatic (e.g., \"Miren:\" or \"afinado\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\"). These break the fluency for a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje\" are correctly rendered. The use of \"afinado\" is less common than \"ajuste fino\", and the retention of English \"prompt\" and French words reduces consistency. Overall the terminology is adequate but not perfectly uniform.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone, but occasional literal translations and leftover French terms make the text feel less adapted to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural nuances are mostly respected, yet the mix of languages detracts from a fully localized version.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas and examples from the original are present. No significant information is omitted, though a duplicated line adds redundancy. Minor untranslated words do not cause loss of meaning but affect polish.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of preserving the technical content and overall structure of the podcast script. It is readable and mostly fluent, with correct handling of most specialized terminology. The main issues are the occasional retention of French words, a few literal phrasing choices, and a duplicated line that introduces redundancy. With minor edits to eliminate the leftover French terms, replace less common word choices (e.g., \"afinado\" → \"ajuste fino\"), and remove the duplication, the translation would reach a higher level of naturalness and polish.\nOverall rating: 14/20."
