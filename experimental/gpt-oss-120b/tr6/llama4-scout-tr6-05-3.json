  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the dialogue format is preserved. However, there are occasional punctuation oddities (extra quotation marks, misplaced colons) and occasional English words left untranslated (e.g., “prompt”). These small glitches slightly disrupt the flow for a native reader.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation uses natural‑sounding Spanish in most places (e.g., “Imagínad que enviamos una nueva IA a la escuela”, “ventana de contexto”). Nevertheless, some expressions feel forced or overly literal (“Es una memoria de uso único”, “chuleta” is informal but acceptable), and the inconsistent use of quotation marks makes the text look less polished.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, anclaje, etc. The term “prompt” is left in English, which is common in the field, but a Spanish equivalent or brief explanation would improve consistency. Overall terminology handling is solid.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator captures the podcast’s informal, conversational tone (use of “¡Exacto!”, “¡Una analogía perfecta!”) and even adds a culturally relevant colloquialism (“chuleta”). The intent and explanatory style of the original are preserved, with only minor slips such as leftover English fragments.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the description of “memory” features as a shortcut. No substantive content is omitted, and the translation remains concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and maintains the lively podcast atmosphere. Strengths include correct technical terminology and faithful transmission of the core concepts. Weaknesses lie mainly in minor formatting inconsistencies, occasional literalness, and the retention of a few English terms that could be localized. With a little polishing, the Spanish version would read as smoothly as a native‑written script.\nOverall score (out of 20): 15"
