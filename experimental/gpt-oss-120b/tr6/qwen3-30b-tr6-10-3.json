    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is riddled with unrelated filler sentences (e.g., “¡Hola, mundo!”, “El resultado final es una traducción en español.”) and placeholders that break the flow. The logical progression of the podcast dialogue is lost, making it very hard for a reader to follow the discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, etc.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text does not read like natural Spanish. It mixes abrupt interjections (“Hola”) with incomplete sentences, literal translations, and meta‑instructions (e.g., “Muestre solo la traducción solicitada”). Grammar is often incorrect and the style is far from conversational.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"pré‑entraînement\", \"affinage\", \"apprentissage par transfert\", \"fenêtre de contexte\" and \"apprentissage en contexte\" are either omitted, mistranslated, or replaced by unrelated English fragments. When they appear, no explanation or consistent translation is provided.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent—to explain how AI models learn and the difference between fine‑tuning and in‑context learning—is almost completely lost. Cultural or contextual adaptation is irrelevant because the content itself is corrupted.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A large portion of the original dialogue is missing (e.g., the analogy about a consultant, the discussion of memory features, the concluding remarks). The translation adds unrelated instructions about extracting translations, which do not belong to the source.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is fundamentally broken. It appears to be an output of a faulty automatic system that interleaved the original script with random prompts, meta‑instructions, and placeholder text. None of the original concepts are reliably conveyed, the language is unnaturally fragmented, and the technical terminology is mishandled. A complete re‑translation by a competent bilingual speaker is required.\n\nScore Summary:\n- Readability: 2/20\n- Fluency: 3/20\n- Terminology: 4/20\n- Contextual Adaptation: 2/20\n- Information Completeness: 1/20\nOverall quality is extremely low."
