  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable. The flow of ideas follows the original and most sentences are clear, allowing readers to grasp the concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning. Minor issues (e.g., occasional redundant quotation marks) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds somewhat stilted in places. There are unnatural constructions such as \"Mira antes de continuar\", \"el IA\", and inconsistent use of the podcast name (\"Tech Express\" vs \"Tech Éclair\"). These hiccups make the text feel less natural for a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, transferencia de aprendizaje, ventana de contexto, ICL). However, the translation of \"grounding\" as \"fijación\" is inaccurate; a more appropriate term would be \"anclaje\" or simply \"grounding\". Some hyphenation inconsistencies (pre‑entrenamiento vs preentrenamiento) also appear.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent and explanatory tone are preserved. The examples and analogies are adapted well for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only notable lapse is the inconsistent podcast title, which may cause slight confusion, but overall the cultural adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary nature of prompt‑based knowledge, and the way \"memory\" features are implemented. No significant content is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and is mostly easy to follow, but it suffers from occasional unnatural phrasing, a few terminology missteps, and inconsistent naming of the podcast. With minor revisions—especially correcting \"grounding\" and smoothing the flow—the text would be fluent and fully natural for Spanish listeners.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14.8/20, rounded to 15/20.\nOverall rating: 15/20."
