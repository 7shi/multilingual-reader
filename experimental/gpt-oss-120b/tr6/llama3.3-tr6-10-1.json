  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly clear and the flow of ideas mirrors the original French script. Minor issues such as \"bienvenidos en\" instead of \"bienvenidos a\" and occasional long sentences slightly reduce smoothness, but a native reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., \"Miren más bien\", \"enraizamiento\" for grounding, missing prepositions, and occasional missing accents). Vocabulary is appropriate, yet the phrasing could be smoother in those spots.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\". The choice of \"enraizamiento\" for \"grounding\" is unconventional; \"anclaje\" would be more common. Nevertheless, the terminology remains consistent and understandable for the target audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation successfully conveys the original intent and tone of the podcast dialogue. Cultural references are neutral and appropriate. Small prepositional errors (\"bienvenidos en\") are the only noticeable mismatches, but they do not alter the overall message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The content is as complete as the original.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is very good. It transmits the technical concepts clearly and keeps the conversational style of the podcast. Minor grammatical slips and a non‑standard term for \"grounding\" keep it from being perfect, but they do not impede comprehension. The translation would benefit from a quick proofread to fix prepositional errors and replace \"enraizamiento\" with a more common term like \"anclaje\" or \"fundamentación\". Otherwise, it is a faithful and readable rendering of the original French script.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
