  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences are easy to follow, and the technical concepts are explained with understandable examples. The only noticeable obstacle is the phrase \"apretar para un examen\", which is not idiomatic Spanish and may momentarily confuse readers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, using appropriate vocabulary and smooth sentence structures. A few constructions feel slightly forced or literal, such as \"Ustedes pueden tomar\" (more natural would be \"Pueden tomar\"), and the aforementioned \"apretar para un examen\". These minor issues prevent a perfect fluency rating.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled consistently and correctly: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, anclaje, etc. The translator kept the original English acronyms and provided accurate Spanish equivalents, which is ideal for the target audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., consulting analogy). The tone remains conversational and suitable for a podcast script. Minor awkwardness in some idioms does not significantly alter the message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No key information is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary material. The only deviation is the slightly inaccurate idiom \"apretar para un examen\", which still conveys the intended meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the full technical content accurately, uses appropriate terminology, and maintains the conversational style of the original podcast. A few non‑idiomatic expressions slightly affect readability and fluency, but they do not hinder comprehension. Minor polishing of those phrases would bring the translation to near‑perfect level.\n\nOverall score (out of 20): 18"
