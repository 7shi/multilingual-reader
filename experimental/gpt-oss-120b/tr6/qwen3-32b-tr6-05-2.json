  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are presented in a logical order. Only a few long sentences could be split for even smoother reading.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a handful of slightly awkward constructions (e.g., “una forma astuta de aprendizaje contextual automatizado”, “El modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus discusiones”). Vocabulary is appropriate and the register matches a podcast style.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally well handled. “Fine‑tuning” is rendered as “afinamiento”, which is understandable though “ajuste fino” is more common in Spanish technical literature. Other terms such as “grounding” → “anclaje”, “ICL” kept as acronym, and “ventana de contexto” are appropriate and used consistently.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts cultural references correctly. The dialogue feels natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor literal translations (e.g., “memoria a corto plazo” for “short‑term memory”) are acceptable in this context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is conveyed: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and the pseudo‑memory feature. No notable omissions; the only slight deviation is the formatting of the rhetorical question, which does not affect meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It faithfully transmits the technical content and conversational tone of the original podcast. A few stylistic tweaks—especially smoothing some awkward phrases and considering more common technical equivalents—would bring it to near‑perfect fluency, but the current version is clear, accurate, and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\n**Strengths:** faithful terminology, clear explanations, good adaptation of the podcast format. **Areas for improvement:** refine occasional awkward phrasing and consider more standard translations for specialized terms like “fine‑tuning”.\n\n**Final rating (out of 100):** 88/100."
