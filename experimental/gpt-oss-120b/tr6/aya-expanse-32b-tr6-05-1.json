  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured, and complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, memory features) are explained in plain language. A few minor punctuation quirks (extra quotation marks, spacing before exclamation marks) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, and most idiomatic expressions are well‑chosen. Small awkwardness appears in isolated phrases such as “Es una analogía perfecta !” (spacing) and the occasional literal rendering of French interjections, but overall the flow is smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “grounding”, “prompt”. Consistency is maintained throughout, and no essential term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the podcast tone to Spanish, using a welcoming opening and keeping the brand name (Tech Éclair) while also offering a Spanish‑style subtitle (Tech Relámpago). Cultural references are neutral, so the original intent is preserved without loss of meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original script is present. No significant details are omitted, and the logical progression of ideas is retained. Minor redundancies (e.g., repeated quotation marks) do not affect the content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical concepts accurately, reads naturally, and keeps the conversational spirit of the podcast. Minor typographic and stylistic tweaks could raise fluency to near‑perfect levels, but the text is fully functional and informative for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
