  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation preserves the logical flow of the original dialogue and explains the concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) in a clear way. Sentences are generally short and easy to follow, making the content accessible to non‑specialist listeners. A few long sentences (e.g., the one about \"memoria de uso único\") could be broken up, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Vocabulary such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"memoria\" are idiomatic. Minor issues appear: the use of \"AEC\" as an abbreviation is not explained, and the occasional literal translation (e.g., \"memorizar de última hora\") sounds a bit forced, but these do not break fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\" kept in English (acceptable), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL/AEC) are appropriate. The translation could have added brief parenthetical explanations for the acronyms AEC/ICL, but the core terminology is consistent and understandable.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts cultural references and the podcast tone well. The Spanish version keeps the informal, conversational style and uses equivalents like \"consultor brillante\" and \"hoja de trucos\" that resonate with Spanish‑speaking listeners. The only slight mismatch is the retention of the French podcast name \"Tech Éclair\", which is fine because it is a proper name.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present: the distinction between pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, and the explanation of the \"memoria\" feature. No major ideas are omitted. Some redundancy (repeating the same explanation twice) mirrors the original script, which is acceptable for a podcast transcript.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is very good. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the engaging podcast dialogue, and reads naturally for a Spanish audience. Minor stylistic tweaks (shortening a few long sentences, clarifying acronyms) would push the quality to near‑perfect.\n\nStrengths: clear explanation of complex AI concepts, consistent terminology, appropriate cultural adaptation.\nWeaknesses: occasional literal phrasing and lack of brief explanations for less‑known acronyms.\n\nThe translation is suitable for publication as a Spanish version of the podcast transcript.\n\nScore out of 100: 86/100 (average of the five criteria)."
