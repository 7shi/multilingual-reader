  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning) are explained with concrete analogies that a non‑expert listener can grasp. Minor hyphenation inconsistencies (e.g., “pre‑entrenamiento”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary (e.g., “ventana de contexto”, “memoria a corto plazo”). A few phrasing choices are slightly formal or redundant (e.g., “es una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”), but they do not break the flow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino (fine‑tuning)”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “anclaje (grounding)”. The parenthetical English equivalents are kept, which helps bilingual audiences. No important term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original podcast tone and adapts cultural references to Spanish‑speaking listeners (e.g., using “ustedes” consistently). The analogies (consultant, cram‑studying vs. learning to ride a bike) are preserved and remain effective. No culturally inappropriate expressions are introduced.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present. No sentences are omitted, and the logical progression of ideas is maintained. The only minor redundancy is the repeated explanation of “memoria a corto plazo”, which is acceptable for clarity.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, keeps the conversational style of the podcast, and remains accessible to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve flow, but they do not detract from the message. The work demonstrates a solid grasp of both languages and the subject matter.\n\nScore breakdown: 18 + 17 + 18 + 17 + 19 = 89/100. This places the translation in the ‘very good’ range, with only small room for refinement in fluency and stylistic polish."
