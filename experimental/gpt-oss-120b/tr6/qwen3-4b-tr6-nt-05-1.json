  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and conveys the podcast dialogue clearly. However, there are several noticeable errors such as \"bienvenido/a en\" instead of \"a\", mixed French fragments (e.g., \"C’est donc\"), and awkward phrases like \"para la tarea a cumplir\" or \"última minute\". These mistakes slightly disrupt the flow for a native reader.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds semi‑natural but suffers from occasional code‑switching and literal renderings (e.g., \"bachotage\", \"ancrage\", \"C’est donc\"). Some sentences are clunky or overly literal, reducing smoothness despite being comprehensible.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (Aprendizaje en contexto)\" etc. The term \"fine‑tuning\" is rendered as \"el afinado\", which is acceptable, but the inconsistency of leaving some words in French or English (\"grounding\", \"ancrage\") lowers consistency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original intent to a Spanish‑speaking audience, preserving the explanatory tone. Nevertheless, residual French expressions and a few literal translations prevent a fully localized feel.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key ideas from the French original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of \"memory\" features. No substantive information is omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate in content and conveys the technical discussion well, but it is marred by occasional language mixing, minor grammatical slips, and some unnatural phrasing. Technical terminology is mostly appropriate, though consistency could be improved. A polished, fully monolingual Spanish version would raise the quality significantly.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
