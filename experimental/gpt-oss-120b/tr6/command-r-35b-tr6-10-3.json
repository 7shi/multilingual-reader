  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the flow of ideas follows the original script. However, the presence of unnecessary quotation marks, mixed use of formal «Usted» and informal «tú», and occasional abrupt phrasing make some passages feel less smooth for a native reader.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several moments where the translation sounds literal or awkward: «Usted puede crear», «aprendizaje automático por contexto automatizado», «sujeción» for grounding, and inconsistent register throughout the dialogue. These issues reduce the naturalness of the language despite the overall meaning being clear.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto are correctly rendered. The term grounding is translated inconsistently as anclaje and later sujeción, and the “Memory” feature is rendered as memoria mejorada, which is not the usual label. Nevertheless, the terminology is largely appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the intent, tone and pedagogical style of the original podcast. Minor cultural adaptations (e.g., renaming the podcast to “Tech Analizado” and “Tech Relámpago”) are acceptable. The main drawback is the inconsistent use of formal/informal pronouns and occasional literal translations that feel out‑of‑place in Spanish.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the major ideas and examples from the French script are present. A few superfluous elements appear (e.g., the numbered note “1. Es cierto…”) and some original nuances are slightly altered, but no essential information is omitted.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core content and technical concepts accurately, but it suffers from stylistic inconsistencies, mixed registers, and occasional literal phrasing that hinder fluency. Terminology is mostly well‑handled, though some terms could be unified. Overall, it is a competent translation that would benefit from a thorough edit to smooth out the language and ensure consistent terminology.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15.4 ≈ 15/20."
