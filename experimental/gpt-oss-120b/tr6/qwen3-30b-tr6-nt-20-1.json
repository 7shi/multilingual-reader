    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "No source French text nor its Spanish translation was provided, so it is impossible to assess how understandable the target text is for Spanish readers, whether complex ideas are explained clearly, or if the sentence flow is logical.",

    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Without seeing the Spanish version, I cannot judge whether the language sounds natural, whether there are awkward constructions, or if the vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary.",

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The evaluation of technical term handling requires the actual translated terminology. Since it is missing, I cannot determine consistency, adequacy, or the need for explanations.",
      "score": 0

      "reasoning": "I cannot verify whether the translation conveys the original intent, respects cultural nuances, or improves the text for the target audience without the texts themselves.",

      "reasoning": "Assessing omission, redundancy, or necessary supplementation is impossible without the original and translated passages.",

    "overall_comment": "The evaluation cannot be performed because the French source text and its Spanish translation were not supplied. Please provide both versions so I can score each criterion accurately and give a comprehensive assessment.\n\nIf you share the texts, I will assign scores (0‑20) for readability, fluency, terminology, contextual adaptation, and information completeness, along with detailed reasoning and an overall comment and score.\n\n*Note: The current scores are set to 0 solely due to the lack of material to evaluate.*"
