  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the explanations of complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning) are understandable. A few sentences are slightly long, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, but there are occasional awkward constructions and inconsistencies (e.g., mixing \"entrenamiento previo\" and \"pre‑entrenamiento\", leaving English words like \"prompt\" and \"ICL\" unchanged, and the use of a semicolon where a comma would be smoother). These minor issues prevent the text from feeling completely fluid to a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly handled correctly: \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are appropriate. The term \"fine‑tuning\" is kept in English, which is acceptable in many technical contexts, but the inconsistency with \"pre‑entrenamiento\" vs. \"entrenamiento previo\" could confuse readers. Overall the terminology is accurate and consistent enough.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style of the podcast. It adapts gender‑inclusive language (\"bienvenidos/as\") appropriately for Spanish‑speaking audiences and keeps cultural references (the podcast name, the consultant analogy) intact. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve readability, but the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are retained: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning, the notion of temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No essential information is omitted or altered.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does an excellent job conveying the technical content and pedagogical tone of the original podcast. Readability and completeness are strong, and the terminology is largely accurate. Fluency suffers from a few awkward phrasings and inconsistencies that a native speaker would likely smooth out, but these do not severely hinder understanding. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation that could be polished further for naturalness and uniform terminology usage.\n\nStrengths: clear exposition of complex concepts, faithful transfer of information, appropriate cultural adaptation.\nAreas for improvement: streamline sentence flow, maintain consistent terminology (choose either \"entrenamiento previo\" or \"pre‑entrenamiento\" throughout), and consider translating remaining English tokens like \"prompt\" for full immersion.\n\nScore: 86/100"
