    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured, and complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained in a straightforward manner. Minor punctuation quirks (e.g., hyphenated «pre‑entrenamiento») do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the text sounds natural to a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and the style matches a podcast script. There are a few slightly stiff or redundant expressions – such as “cuando ustedes abren una nueva ventana” and the alternation between “afinamiento” and “ajuste fino” – but they do not break the flow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is well handled: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento/fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, etc. The only minor issue is the inconsistency between “afinamiento” and later “ajuste fino”, which could confuse readers unfamiliar with both terms. Otherwise the terms are accurate and consistent with current Spanish‑language AI literature.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French idioms and analogies to Spanish culture (e.g., “como contratar a un consultor brillante”). The tone remains conversational and the examples are relatable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. No cultural mis‑steps are evident.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original script is retained. No sentences or concepts are omitted, and the emphasis (bold markup) is preserved. The translation even keeps the explanatory asides (e.g., “¡Una analogía perfecta!”) intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains readable and engaging, and mostly sounds natural in Spanish. Minor stylistic inconsistencies (use of two different terms for fine‑tuning and a few slightly formal constructions) prevent a perfect score, but they do not affect the overall effectiveness of the podcast script.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.4 / 20.\n\n**Strengths**: precise terminology, clear explanations, good cultural adaptation.\n**Areas for improvement**: unify the term for fine‑tuning and smooth a few stiff phrases.\n**Recommendation**: The text can be used as‑is for a Spanish‑language podcast; a quick proof‑read to harmonize \"afinamiento\"/\"ajuste fino\" would make it flawless.\n\n**Overall score**: 18.4"
