  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall understandable, but the presence of nonsensical filler (e.g., the long “Cartesian token” line) and a completely unrelated line “Camille: el gato está en el tejado” breaks the flow. Several sentences are long and lack proper punctuation, making it harder for a reader to follow the argument. Consequently, readability is limited.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many phrases are literal translations from French and sound awkward in Spanish (e.g., “Imaginense que enviamos una IA…”, “Lo olvida todo”, “Se tiene la impresión”). There are missing accents, gender agreement errors and occasional misuse of articles. The text does not read smoothly as native Spanish would.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto” and “ICL” are correctly rendered. The word “grounding” is kept in parentheses, which is acceptable. However, consistency suffers in places (e.g., sometimes “ajuste fino”, sometimes “el ajuste”). Overall the terminology is adequate but not flawless.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and explanatory tone, but cultural and stylistic adaptation is weak. Several sentences are literal and sound stilted, and the random token string disrupts the context. The overall adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience is therefore only partial.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Nearly all the information from the French script is present, including the discussion of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning and memory tricks. The extraneous token line and the stray cat sentence are noise, but they do not remove essential content. Some minor details are phrased less clearly, but no major ideas are omitted.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core ideas of the podcast and includes the necessary technical concepts, but its quality is hampered by significant noise, awkward phrasing, and occasional grammatical mistakes. A reader would grasp the main points, yet the experience is disrupted by the garbled sections and non‑natural language. Substantial editing and cleanup are required to reach a professional level suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 9/20.\n\nScore out of 20 points (overall): 9"
