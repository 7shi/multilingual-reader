    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original ideas clearly and the sentences follow a logical order. Most complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto, afinamiento) are explained in a way that a Spanish‑speaking audience can understand. A few minor stylistic quirks (e.g., “Vean esto” instead of a more natural “Miren esto”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the text reads naturally, but there are several awkward or ungrammatical fragments: “Ustedes pueden tomar…”, “Los nuevas conocimientos…”, “se acuerda” (instead of “se acuerda de” or “se acuerda”). The mix of formal and informal registers and the occasional literal translation (“prompt”) make the flow feel slightly stilted for a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely preserved and appropriate: preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning, transferencia de aprendizaje, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding → anclaje, prompt, etc. The translator kept English loanwords where they are standard in the field. The only noticeable error is a grammatical mismatch in “Los nuevas conocimientos”, but it does not change the technical meaning.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the podcast format and the conversational tone expected for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral and the style is suitable for a tech‑focused podcast. Minor pronoun inconsistencies (mix of “Ustedes” and “tú”) slightly affect cohesion, but the intent and purpose are fully retained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto, la diferencia entre memoria temporal y permanente, y la explicación de las funciones de “Memoria”. No essential information is omitted, and no superfluous content is added.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is generally accurate and conveys the full content of the original French podcast script. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency suffers from a handful of grammatical slips and occasional unnatural phrasing. Contextual adaptation is good, preserving the podcast’s tone and making the material accessible to Spanish listeners. With minor editing to fix grammatical errors and smooth out the register, the translation would reach a near‑native level of quality.\nOverall score: 84/100.\n\n**Breakdown:** Readability 17, Fluency 14, Terminology 16, Contextual Adaptation 18, Information Completeness 19."
