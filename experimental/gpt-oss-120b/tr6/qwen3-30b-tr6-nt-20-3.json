  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "I cannot assess readability because the original French source and its Spanish translation have not been provided. Without seeing the sentences, I cannot determine whether the content is easy to understand, whether complex ideas are clarified, or whether the sentence flow is logical for Spanish readers.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Fluency and naturalness can only be judged by examining the actual Spanish text. Since the translation is missing, I cannot evaluate whether the language sounds native, whether there are awkward constructions, or if the vocabulary is appropriate.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Evaluating technical terminology requires knowledge of the specific terms used in both the source and target languages. Without the text, I cannot verify consistency, adequacy, or the need for explanations.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Contextual adaptation hinges on how well the translation conveys the original intent, cultural nuances, and any necessary optimizations for Spanish‑speaking readers. This cannot be judged without the material to compare.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "I need the source and target texts to check whether any information was omitted, added, or redundantly repeated. In the absence of the translation, I cannot assess completeness.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "The requested evaluation cannot be performed because the French source text and its Spanish translation were not supplied. Please provide the original passage and its translation, and I will gladly score each criterion (readability, fluency, terminology, contextual adaptation, and information completeness) with detailed reasoning and a final overall assessment."
