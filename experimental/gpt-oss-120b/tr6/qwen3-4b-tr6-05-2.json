  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the explanations of complex AI concepts are clear. Sentence order follows the original and most ideas are conveyed logically. Minor issues such as the leftover French exclamation “Exactement!” and a few awkward constructions slightly disrupt flow, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward phrasing choices (e.g., “la competencia está anclada”, “cada vez que monte en silla”, over‑use of “Usted”, spacing before “!”). The presence of French words inside Spanish sentences also makes the prose feel less fluid for a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, grounding/ancrage, etc. The terms are consistently used and the occasional parenthetical English/French equivalents help the reader. No major mistranslations of technical concepts.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is needed. The few French remnants slightly detract from a fully localized version, but overall the message is conveyed appropriately.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No sections are omitted, and the examples and analogies are retained. Minor typographical artifacts (French words) do not constitute loss of content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is accurate and conveys the technical content well. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency suffers from occasional literal translations and leftover French interjections. With a light edit to smooth out awkward phrasing and remove the French exclamations, the text would reach a near‑native level of naturalness.\n\nFinal score (out of 100): 83/100."
