  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the ideas are clearly expressed. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are understandable. Minor hiccups such as occasional overly long sentences do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but a few lexical choices feel forced or uncommon for a native speaker (e.g., \"afianzamiento\" for fine‑tuning, repetitive \"aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\"). These affect smoothness, though the majority of the prose reads fluently.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely correct: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\". The term for fine‑tuning is translated as \"afianzamiento\", which is not the standard \"ajuste fino\" or \"fine‑tuning\" and may confuse readers familiar with the field. \"Anclaje\" for grounding is acceptable but less common.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original podcast’s tone and purpose, keeps proper names (Tech Éclair) and adapts idioms to Spanish (e.g., \"como contratar a un consultor brillante\"). Cultural references are preserved, and the overall intent is conveyed effectively.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present; no ideas are omitted or distorted. The only minor issue is a slight redundancy in the ICL explanation, but it does not reduce completeness.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the original content and maintains a clear, instructional tone suitable for a tech‑focused podcast audience. Readability and completeness are strong, while fluency and terminology suffer from a few non‑standard word choices, most notably the translation of \"fine‑tuning\". With minor adjustments the text would feel completely natural to Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16.8 → rounded to 17/20."
