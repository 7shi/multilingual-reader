    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences are understandable, and complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinado y aprendizaje en contexto are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can follow. However, there are occasional awkward constructions (e.g., \"Podéis tomar un modelo…\" vs the rest of the text that uses \"tú\"/\"usted\"), and some stray quotation marks that slightly disrupt the flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few expressions feel literal or unidiomatic. The use of the second‑person plural \"Podéis\" is inconsistent with the rest of the dialogue, which mostly uses singular forms. There are also unnecessary quotation marks, missing accents (e.g., \"Preciso\" instead of \"Precisamente\"), and a few sentences that are overly long or literal translations of the French phrasing, which a native speaker would re‑phrase more fluidly.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Words like \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are correctly rendered. The translation of \"grounding\" as \"enraizamiento\" is acceptable, though \"anclaje\" or \"fundamentación\" might be more common; still, the term is consistent throughout. Overall, the terminology is accurate and appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent and pedagogical tone are preserved. The translator adapts the explanations to Spanish‑speaking listeners without losing nuance. Cultural references are minimal in the source, so no major adaptation was needed. Minor issues such as the inconsistent use of \"tú\" vs \"vosotros\" slightly affect the sense of a single podcast dialogue, but the overall message remains intact.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the logical progression of the discussion (pre‑entrenamiento → afinado → aprendizaje por transferencia → aprendizaje en contexto → memoria) is maintained. The only minor differences are typographic (extra quotation marks) that do not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and successfully conveys the technical concepts of AI training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Terminology is accurate and the overall structure mirrors the original podcast script. The main weaknesses lie in fluency and stylistic consistency—particularly the mixed use of pronouns and occasional literal phrasing—that prevent the text from feeling completely natural. With a few editorial adjustments, the translation would reach a higher level of polish, but as it stands it is a high‑quality rendering suitable for the intended audience."
