    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the structure of the original dialogue. However, there are several typographical and grammatical errors (e.g., “Es todo el poder de esta enfoque”, “Las conocencias”, “incrediblemente flexible”) that slightly disrupt the flow. Despite these issues, a native reader can grasp the main ideas without major difficulty.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many literal renderings and awkward expressions that sound unnatural to a native speaker: “Usted ha entendido todo”, “es del cramar”, “cramar para un examen”, and inconsistent use of formal / informal address. These reduce the overall smoothness, even though the meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly – “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (Aprendizaje en contexto)”. The term “grounding” is left in English, which is acceptable in a technical context. Minor errors like “conocencias” instead of “conocimientos” slightly affect precision.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and explanatory tone, but some idiomatic choices are off (e.g., “cramar” is not a Spanish verb, the formal ‘Usted’ versus the original informal tone). Cultural adaptation is minimal, which is fine for a technical podcast, yet the unnatural phrasing detracts from full adaptation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No substantive content is omitted, though a few errors (e.g., misspelling, missing accents) slightly affect clarity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full substance of the original podcast and uses appropriate technical vocabulary, but it suffers from several grammatical slips, awkward literal translations, and occasional wrong word choices that affect naturalness and readability. A native Spanish speaker would understand the content, yet would notice the translation feels somewhat stilted and would benefit from polishing the phrasing and correcting typographical errors.\nOverall rating reflects a solid but imperfect rendering of the source material.\nScore: 14/20 (average of the five criteria)."
