    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text conveys the original ideas and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. Most sentences are easy to follow, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can grasp. However, there are a few moments where the wording is awkward (e.g., the duplicated phrase in Camille’s line about “informaciones” and the missing causal connector “porque”) that slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but several issues lower the fluency score: the use of the Argentine‑style “podés” in an otherwise neutral Spanish text, the odd expression “montas en silla”, the mix of pronouns (“tus” vs “vuestras”), the leftover French word *requête*, and the redundancy in Camille’s sentence about providing information. These elements make the dialogue feel less polished for a general Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely well handled. The translator kept key terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje en contexto” and “ICL”. The only notable deviation is the untranslated English phrase *transfer learning* (which could have been rendered as “aprendizaje por transferencia”). Consistency is good, and the terms are appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the intent, tone, and pedagogical style of the original podcast. Cultural references are neutral, and the speaker roles are clear. Minor mismatches (regional vocabulary, the literal “montas en silla”, and occasional mixed pronouns) slightly reduce the adaptation quality, but the core message remains intact.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the examples (English‑to‑French transfer, consultant analogy, memory feature) are retained. Small stylistic omissions (e.g., the missing “porque” before “ya comprende”) do not affect factual completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content and the conversational tone of the original podcast. It is largely complete and accurate, but several linguistic slips—redundancy, regionalisms, minor grammatical errors, and an occasional untranslated word—prevent it from reaching a higher level of naturalness. A careful proofreading pass focusing on uniform Spanish usage, removal of duplicated phrasing, and consistent terminology would raise the overall quality substantially."
