  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the dialogue flows logically. Most sentences are easy to understand, and the technical concepts are conveyed without major ambiguity. However, a few typographical errors (e.g., \"rfine\", \"mнера\") and occasional awkward phrasing slightly impede smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several spots where the wording feels forced or inconsistent: mixed use of \"tus\" and \"vuestras\", the untranslated French term \"bachotage\", and the garbled phrase \"Es la mнера ideal de plantear el problema\". These issues reduce the overall naturalness for native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as «pré‑entraînement», «fine‑tuning», «transfer learning», «in‑context learning (ICL)», and «prompt» are correctly rendered and consistently used. The only drawback is the decision to keep the French word \"bachotage\" instead of providing a Spanish equivalent or brief explanation, which could confuse some readers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., using «consultor» instead of «consultant»). Minor issues like the mixed pronoun forms and the stray French punctuation (« ») are present, but they do not substantially alter the message.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the ideas and details from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is preserved. Minor typographical glitches do not cause loss of meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the technical content well. It would benefit from a careful proofreading pass to fix typographical errors, smooth out inconsistent pronoun usage, and replace the residual French term \"bachotage\" with a clear Spanish equivalent. Once these refinements are made, the text would read like a polished native‑level podcast script.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 16/20, Fluency 14/20, Terminology 15/20, Contextual Adaptation 15/20, Information Completeness 18/20. The average yields a solid 16/20 overall.\n\nRecommendations: \n1. Correct typos (\"rfine\", \"mнера\").\n2. Choose a consistent second‑person pronoun (either \"tú\"/\"tu\" or \"vosotros\"/\"vuestras\").\n3. Translate or explain \"bachotage\" (e.g., \"estudio intensivo\" o \"memorización para un examen\").\n4. Replace French guillemets with Spanish quotation marks if desired.\n5. Ensure all sentences read fluidly for a native audience.\n\nWith these adjustments, the translation would reach a near‑native level of quality.\n\nFinal overall score: 16/20."
