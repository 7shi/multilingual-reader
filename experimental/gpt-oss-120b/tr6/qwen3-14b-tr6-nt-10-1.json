  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly clear and the logical flow mirrors the original French script. Minor issues such as very long sentences and occasional punctuation quirks do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several noticeable slips: \"Los nuevas conocimientos\" (gender/number error), \"se acuerda\" (less idiomatic than \"se acuerda\" or \"recuerda\"), and a few awkward constructions like \"la IA no está constantemente afinada por sus conversaciones\". These reduce the overall fluency for native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto and anclaje (grounding) are correctly translated and consistently used. No important term is lost or mis‑rendered.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. A small stylistic mismatch is the opening \"Buenos días\" for a podcast, but it does not affect the message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is omitted, and the examples remain intact. Minor grammatical errors do not cause loss of content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. Readability and terminology are strong points, while fluency suffers from a handful of grammatical slips and slightly awkward phrasing. With minor proofreading, the text would read as a smooth, native‑like podcast script.\n\nStrengths: clear explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning; consistent use of technical vocabulary; faithful preservation of the original dialogue.\nWeaknesses: occasional gender/number agreement errors, non‑idiomatic verb choices, and a few long, cumbersome sentences that could be split for better flow.\n\nRecommendation: a final editorial pass focusing on agreement, idiomatic expressions, and sentence length would raise the score into the high‑80s/90s range.\n\nFinal total score (out of 100): 83.\n\n---\n**Scoring Summary**\n- Readability: 16/20\n- Fluency: 14/20\n- Terminology: 18/20\n- Contextual Adaptation: 17/20\n- Information Completeness: 18/20\n- **Overall:** 83/100"
