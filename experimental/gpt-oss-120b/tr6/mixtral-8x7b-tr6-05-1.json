  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is riddled with fragmented sentences, stray meta‑comments, and inconsistent speaker labels. Paragraphs jump between translation notes and dialogue, making it hard for a reader to follow the podcast flow. Several sentences are grammatically incomplete (e.g., “las conocimientos persistan en todas las conversaciones, para siempre”). Consequently, comprehension requires extra effort.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many expressions sound unnatural or outright incorrect: “ancraje” instead of the usual “anclaje”, “una astucieza”, “Aprendizaje Continuo Industrializado”, and mismatched gender agreements such as “las conocimientos”. The text also retains English fragments and unnecessary parenthetical explanations, which break the natural rhythm of Spanish.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL) are present, but several are mistranslated or inconsistently rendered (e.g., “aprendizaje continuo industrializado” for ICL, “memoria a corto plazo” is correct but later confused). The handling of terminology is uneven, leading to potential confusion for the target audience.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original podcast tone (conversational, explanatory) is lost. The translation inserts editorial remarks, explanations of translation choices, and even a user‑assistant interaction that never existed in the source. Cultural adaptation is minimal; instead, the text feels like a draft with side notes rather than a polished Spanish podcast script.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "While most dialogue points are present, several ideas are omitted, altered, or duplicated. Meta‑information about how the translation was produced distracts from the content. Some original nuances (e.g., the metaphor of a consultant) are diluted or expressed awkwardly.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation falls far short of a publishable Spanish version of the original French podcast. It mixes translation output, editor notes, and incorrect terminology, resulting in low readability and fluency. Significant revision is required: remove meta‑comments, correct terminology, ensure consistent gender and number agreement, and restore the natural, conversational style of the original dialogue.\nOverall score: 6/20."
