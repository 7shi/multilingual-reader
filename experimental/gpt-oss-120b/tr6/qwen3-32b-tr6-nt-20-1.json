  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the original structure. Most sentences convey the ideas clearly, but occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., “Usted lo ha entendido todo”, mixed formal‑informal pronouns) slightly hinders smooth reading.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds a bit stilted in places. Literal translations such as “ventana de contexto”, “anclaje”, and the inconsistent use of “Usted” versus “tú” make the prose feel less natural to native speakers. Nonetheless, the overall flow is acceptable.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, grounding → anclaje, etc. The terminology is consistent and appropriate for a technically‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the original intent, tone, and educational style. Minor cultural mismatches (e.g., the use of formal “Usted” in a casual podcast) and leftover formatting markers (**Luc:**) slightly reduce adaptation quality, but the message remains intact.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present; no substantive content is omitted. The only losses are superficial formatting artifacts, which do not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the technical content effectively. The main weaknesses lie in fluency and consistency of register, with occasional literal constructions and leftover markup. Technical terminology is strong, and the information is complete, making the translation suitable for a knowledgeable Spanish‑speaking audience after a light editorial polish."
