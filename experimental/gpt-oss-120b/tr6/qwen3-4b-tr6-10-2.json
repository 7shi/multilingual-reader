  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is mostly clear and the flow of ideas is preserved. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en” instead of “a”, “las conocencias” instead of “los conocimientos”) do not block comprehension, but they slightly affect smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural to a native speaker: mixing formal \"Usted\" with informal tone, literal translations like \"bacheo\" for \"cramming\", and the unchanged French word \"antisèche\". These issues make the text feel stilted, though the overall meaning remains intact.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL) is correctly rendered and consistently used. The term “prompt” is left in English, which is acceptable in a technical context. Overall terminology handling is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent, but cultural‑linguistic adaptation is uneven. Phrases like “Hola y bienvenido en” and the retention of some French‑style constructions reduce naturalness for Spanish‑speaking audiences.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas from the French script are present; no major information is lost. Minor lexical choices (e.g., keeping \"antisèche\") do not omit content, only affect polish.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the technical content and overall structure well, but suffers from several fluency and stylistic issues that make it feel slightly mechanical and occasionally awkward. With minor editing to improve naturalness and correct a few grammatical errors, it would be an excellent Spanish rendition of the podcast script.\nOverall score (out of 100): 81."
