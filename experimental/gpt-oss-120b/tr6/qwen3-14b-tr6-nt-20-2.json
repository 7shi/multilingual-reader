    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly clear and the flow of ideas follows the original French script. Most sentences are easy to understand, and the technical concepts are explained in a straightforward way. Minor issues such as the typo \"informaciónes\", the slightly clunky phrase \"es del bachotaje\" (should be \"es como el bachotaje\"), and occasional punctuation quirks slightly hurt smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural, but there are a few awkward constructions and typographical errors that a native speaker would notice. Examples include \"memoria de corto plazo\" (more common would be \"memoria a corto plazo\"), the unnecessary space in \"¡Exactamente !\", and the use of the English word \"prompt\" without adaptation. These imperfections prevent a fully fluent reading experience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\" and \"ventana de contexto\" are appropriate. The term \"fine-tuning\" is left in English, which is acceptable in many technical contexts but could have been rendered as \"ajuste fino\" for consistency. Overall the terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is needed. Small linguistic quirks (e.g., \"es del bachotaje\") slightly reduce the naturalness, but the overall message is conveyed effectively to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is retained. No major ideas are omitted, and the examples (English to French, consultant analogy, memory feature) are fully present. The only drawbacks are typographical errors that do not affect content meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the technical content well. It is readable and mostly fluent, with a solid handling of terminology. Minor typographical mistakes and a few slightly awkward phrases prevent it from being perfect, but the overall quality is high and suitable for the intended audience of Spanish‑speaking listeners interested in AI concepts.\n\nStrengths: correct technical terms, faithful rendering of concepts, good overall coherence.\nWeaknesses: occasional typos, some unnatural phrasing, inconsistent handling of a few English loanwords.\n\nOverall, the work is a strong translation that only needs light proofreading and stylistic smoothing to reach a native‑speaker‑level polish.\n\nScore out of 100: 82/100."
