  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear, step‑by‑step manner. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained with simple analogies that are easy for a non‑specialist audience to follow. Minor punctuation inconsistencies do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few expressions are slightly awkward or non‑idiomatic (e.g., “el afinamiento” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”, “se le dan las informaciones de las que necesita”). These slips prevent the text from being completely fluid for native speakers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is well‑handled: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, transferencia de aprendizaje, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding (ancaje) are all retained or explained. The only slight drawback is the use of “ancaje”, which is less usual than “anclaje”, but the meaning is clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the conversational podcast tone, adapted cultural references (e.g., “consultor brillante”) and kept the educational intent intact. The Spanish wording respects the target audience’s expectations and cultural context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and no unnecessary repetition is introduced. The content remains as comprehensive as the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and faithful to the source, conveying the educational narrative clearly. While the readability and completeness are strong, fluency could be improved by smoothing a few non‑idiomatic phrases and refining terminology such as “afinamiento”. The technical terminology is appropriate and consistent, and the adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience is effective.\n\nFinal average score: 18/20, indicating a high‑quality translation with minor room for polish.\n\nScore out of 20 points (average): 18.0"
