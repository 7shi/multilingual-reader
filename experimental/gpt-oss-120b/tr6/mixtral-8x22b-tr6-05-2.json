  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are generally short and the logical flow mirrors the original. Listeners can understand the concepts without difficulty. Minor punctuation quirks do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most of the script. A few expressions feel slightly off for native speakers (e.g., “Ustedes han comprendido todo”, the comma in “El aprendizaje en contexto, es…”, and occasional word order), but these do not break the flow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly correct: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino / afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto. However, there is inconsistency between “ajuste fino” and “afinamiento”, and a typo in “ancoraje” (should be “anclaje”). These issues lower the score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style of the podcast. Cultural references are appropriate, and the Spanish wording fits a spoken‑media format. Only minimal adjustments would improve idiomatic resonance.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and analogies from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is omitted, and the structure remains faithful to the source.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical content clearly. Minor issues with terminology consistency and a few slightly unnatural phrasing points keep it from being perfect, but the listener will receive the intended message without confusion. The work demonstrates a good command of both languages and the subject matter."
