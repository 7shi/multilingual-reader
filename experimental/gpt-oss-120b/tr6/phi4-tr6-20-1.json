  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original ideas clearly and the dialogue flows logically for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Most sentences are easy to follow, and technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can grasp. Minor hiccups (e.g., the repeated use of “las informaciones”) slightly affect smoothness but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural in Spanish: “aplastarse para un examen”, “el bachillerato de último momento”, “en las sombras”, and the leftover French word “Précisément”. These choices break the natural rhythm a native speaker expects, even though the rest of the text is fluid.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: preentrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, grounding → anclaje, etc. The terms are consistent throughout and appropriate for the intended audience. Only a small omission is the untranslated French interjection, which does not affect the technical meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and adapts the content for Spanish listeners. Cultural references are neutral and suitable. However, some idiomatic choices (“aplastarse”, “bachillerato de último momento”) feel forced and could be replaced by more common Spanish equivalents, slightly weakening the adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present; no major ideas are omitted. The only minor loss is the untranslated French word “Précisément”, which is a negligible detail. No redundant or extraneous material is added.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is accurate and captures the technical content well. Readability is good, and terminology is consistently applied. The main weaknesses lie in fluency – a few awkward idioms and a leftover French word – and in some less natural phrasing that could be refined. With minor stylistic adjustments, the text would read like a native‑speaker podcast script.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
