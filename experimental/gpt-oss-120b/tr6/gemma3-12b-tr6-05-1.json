    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the flow of ideas mirrors the original. Minor hiccups such as the slash in “bienvenidos/as” and occasional long sentences slightly affect smoothness, but overall a Spanish‑speaking listener can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but a few expressions feel awkward or literal. Examples: “Buenos días y bienvenidos/as” (unusual in spoken podcast introductions), “empezara a hablar con usted” (better as “empezara a hablarle”), and retaining French words like “grounding” and “ancrage”. These issues prevent the text from feeling completely native‑like.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”. However, the term “grounding” is left untranslated, and the French “ancrage” appears in parentheses, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the French word. Consistency is good, but a fully Spanish adaptation would replace them with “anclaje”.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural adaptation is modest; using “Buenos días” instead of a more neutral “Hola” limits the greeting to the morning. Apart from that, the content is appropriate for Spanish‑speaking audiences and no cultural references are mis‑rendered.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent knowledge distinction, and the explanation of “memoria” features. No substantive content is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does an admirable job of conveying the technical discussion in a clear and faithful way. Readability and completeness are strong, and most terminology is correctly rendered. Fluency suffers from a few literal renderings and retained French words, and the adaptation could be smoother with more idiomatic Spanish phrasing. Overall, it is a solid translation that would be easily understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience, though a final polish by a native speaker would raise its naturalness to a higher level."
