  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the concepts are explained in a way that a non‑specialist audience can understand. Minor issues such as the slash in \"bienvenidos/as\" and the isolated line \"El pre‑entrenamiento\" slightly hinder fluid reading, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural for the most part, but there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., \"buenos días y bienvenidos/as\", \"Es una memoria de única vez\", \"parte de un contexto vacío\"). These phrases are understandable but would not be the first choice of a native speaker. Overall, the fluency is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\". The term \"grounding\" is left in English with the original French word in parentheses, which may be acceptable for a tech‑savvy audience but could be replaced by a Spanish equivalent (\"anclaje\"). The word \"prompt\" is also kept in English, which is common in the field. Consistency is maintained.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of the podcast. Cultural references are minimal, and the adaptation to Spanish (e.g., \"buenos días\") is appropriate, though a neutral greeting like \"Hola\" might have been more universal. The gender‑inclusive \"bienvenidos/as\" feels forced. Overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No important details are omitted, and the logical flow of the dialogue is kept intact. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does an excellent job conveying the technical content of the original French podcast to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Readability and completeness are strong points. Fluency suffers from a few clunky phrases, and some terminology could be fully localized, but these issues are relatively minor. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for its intended audience.\n\n**Total score:** 88/100 (average 17.6/20 per criterion)."
