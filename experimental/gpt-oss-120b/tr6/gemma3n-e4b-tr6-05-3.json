  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas are easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. Minor issues such as a leftover French word (\"Donc\"), a misspelled \"Transformeers\" and a few awkward phrasings slightly reduce smoothness, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several fluency problems: inconsistent pronoun use (\"usted\" vs \"tú\"), typographical errors (\"rfine\"), occasional literal translations (e.g., \"Da la impresión de que realmente están empezando a recordar cosas de una sesión a otra\"), and a few unnatural collocations. These make the text feel less natural for native speakers, though the overall meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly. \"Pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" and \"prompt\" are retained or appropriately translated. The only inconsistency is the untranslated French \"Transformeers\" and the occasional mixing of English/French terms, but overall the terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast’s informal, conversational tone and the educational intent. Cultural adaptation is minimal but acceptable; the text does not contain references that would be confusing to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor leftovers from the source (e.g., \"Donc\") and a few phrasing choices could be smoother, but the original purpose is conveyed effectively.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No substantive ideas are omitted, and the flow of the dialogue is maintained. Small typographical errors (\"rfine\") and a few redundant or slightly altered expressions are present, but they do not cause loss of content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of conveying the original podcast script, keeping the technical explanations understandable and the overall tone intact. It suffers from occasional typographical slips, mixed pronoun usage, and a few residual French words, which slightly affect naturalness and fluency. Nevertheless, the essential information and pedagogical intent are preserved, making it a good, if not perfect, translation.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
