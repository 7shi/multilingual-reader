  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version flows logically and the ideas are presented clearly. Complex concepts are explained in a way that a native speaker can follow without difficulty. A few sentences are long, but they remain comprehensible. No major obstacles to understanding are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the text sounds natural, but there are a handful of slightly awkward constructions (e.g., \"la IA no ha «olvidado» en el sentido humano\", \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\"). Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, yet those minor hiccups prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" and \"prompt\" are handled consistently and correctly. The decision to keep \"grounding\" in English is acceptable for a technical audience, though a Spanish equivalent could be offered. No terminology errors were found.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, adapts the podcast name to \"Tech Relámpago\", and uses phrasing that fits Spanish‑speaking listeners. Cultural references are neutral and the style matches a conversational podcast format. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve resonance, but the adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, no extraneous content is added, and the logical sequence of the dialogue is maintained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality: it faithfully conveys the original content, uses appropriate technical language, and remains easy to understand for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor fluency issues and a few stylistic choices keep it from being flawless, but overall it is an excellent rendering of the source material."
