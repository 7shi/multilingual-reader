  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas are easy to follow. However, there are a few awkward phrasings (e.g., “¡Ya lo he oído este término!”) and missing punctuation that slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several sentences feel literal or stilted (“Imaginen que envían una nueva inteligencia artificial…”, “Es una memoria de uso único”). Minor typographical errors (duplicate speaker tags, misplaced asterisks) also affect fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is well‑handled: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje, etc., are consistently rendered. The only minor inconsistency is the occasional use of “afinado” vs. “afinamiento”.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately. A small slip is the final sign‑off that keeps the French podcast title “Tech Éclair” instead of the Spanish version “Desglosando Tecnología”. Overall, the message is conveyed correctly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original script are present; no major ideas are omitted. Small formatting glitches (duplicate “Luc:” label) do not affect content. The translation is therefore complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning. Terminology is accurate and the overall structure mirrors the original. Nonetheless, occasional literal translations, punctuation errors, and minor inconsistencies prevent it from feeling completely natural to a native Spanish speaker. With a few edits to smooth phrasing and fix typographical issues, the text would reach a higher level of polish.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria) : 16/20."
