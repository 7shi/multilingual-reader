  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are clear and the flow of ideas mirrors the original. Minor hiccups (e.g., “memoria de corto alcance” instead of the more idiomatic “memoria a corto plazo”) slightly affect smoothness, but overall a native‑speaker could understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several expressions that sound a bit forced or literal: “aprendizaje previo” for pre‑training, “aprendizaje por contexto” (instead of the usual “aprendizaje en contexto”), the unusual abbreviation “AIC”, and occasional mismatched pronouns (“vuestro” vs “su”). These choices break the natural rhythm, though the passage remains intelligible.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly (e.g., “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “anclaje”). However, some key terms are mistranslated or inconsistently handled: “pre‑training” → “aprendizaje previo” (less common), “In‑Context Learning” → “AIC” (new abbreviation), and “short‑term memory window” → “memoria de corto alcance”. This reduces precision for a technically‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original podcast tone and conveys the intended contrasts between fine‑tuning and in‑context learning. Cultural adaptation is adequate; the occasional colloquial exclamation (“¡Ahí está el aprendizaje en contexto en acción!”) fits Spanish podcast style. Minor stylistic oddities (mix of formal and informal registers) prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, the temporary vs permanent knowledge distinction, and the “memory” feature that retrieves past exchanges. No significant content is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of delivering the technical discussion to a Spanish‑speaking audience. It is readable and contains virtually all the information from the original. The main weaknesses lie in occasional unnatural phrasing and inconsistent handling of specialized terminology, especially the translation of ‘pre‑training’ and the introduction of a new acronym for In‑Context Learning. With a few adjustments to terminology and smoother phrasing, the text would reach a native‑level quality.\nOverall score: 76/100.\n\n**Strengths**: clear structure, faithful content transfer, good handling of most technical concepts.\n**Areas for improvement**: adopt standard Spanish technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje en contexto), keep abbreviations consistent, and refine idiomatic expressions for greater fluency.\n\nOverall, a competent translation that only needs minor polishing to achieve native‑speaker naturalness and terminological precision.\n\n**Total score (sum of the five criteria)**: 76/100."
