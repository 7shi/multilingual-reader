  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. Sentence structures are logical, and listeners can understand the discussion. Minor issues such as the odd phrasing “montas en silla” and occasional abrupt transitions slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are a few awkward expressions and inconsistent regional registers (e.g., “Podés” together with “vuestras”). Some sentences feel literal (“le das solo los documentos”) and the “montas en silla” phrase is unidiomatic.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms (preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, anclaje, memoria a corto plazo) are correctly rendered and consistently used. No important term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast style to Spanish well and respects the target audience. Cultural references are appropriate, though the mixture of dialectal forms (vos, vosotros) slightly reduces cohesion.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present. No ideas are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary material.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original content accurately and is largely clear and technically sound. Fluency and register consistency could be improved, but the text remains highly usable for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience.\nScore out of 20: 17/20."
