  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated dialogue is generally understandable, but there are several grammatical slips (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido/a en”, “para le dar”, “C’est donc una memoria”) and occasional French words that interrupt the flow. The sentence structure follows the original, but the small errors force the reader to pause, lowering smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Spanish phrasing is often literal from French, producing unnatural expressions such as “el afinado”, “es el bachotage”, and the mixed‑language fragment “C’est donc una memoria”. The use of “bienvenido/a en” and the retention of French terms like “antisèche” further reduce native‑speaker naturalness.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding, etc. Consistency is good, though a few French words remain (e.g., “C’est donc”, “bachotage”), which slightly harms precision.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original tone but does not fully adapt cultural references. French‑specific words like “antisèche” and “bachotage” are left untranslated, and some French‑style constructions are retained, making the text feel less natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the original script are present; no major content is omitted. Minor linguistic errors do not affect the conveyed information, so the translation is essentially complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full content and most technical terminology correctly, but it suffers from noticeable fluency and readability problems caused by literal translations, leftover French words, and occasional grammatical mistakes. A native‑speaker edit would be needed to smooth the language and fully adapt cultural references. Overall, the translation is functional but not polished.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
