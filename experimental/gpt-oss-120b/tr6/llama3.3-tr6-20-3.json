  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation conveys the ideas in a clear and logical way. Sentences are generally easy to follow, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained with adequate examples. A few sentences are long (e.g., the one about opening a new window) but they remain comprehensible. No major ambiguities impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural for the most part and uses appropriate vocabulary for a podcast audience. Minor awkwardness appears in a few literal renderings (e.g., \"Cuando abres una nueva ventana\" where \"sesión\" would be more idiomatic, and the formal \"hablar con usted\" in a conversational setting). Overall, the flow is smooth and there are no glaring grammatical errors.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated and kept in Spanish where they are already common (preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, anclaje). The acronym ICL is retained, and the explanation of \"grounding\" is provided. No terminology is misused or omitted.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the target‑culture expectations: it uses a neutral register suitable for a tech podcast, adapts examples (e.g., \"consultor brillante\"), and maintains the original intent. The only slight mismatch is the formal tone in a few places, but it does not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No sentences or ideas are omitted, and the nuanced distinction between temporary knowledge (ICL) and permanent skill (fine‑tuning) is preserved. Redundancies are kept as in the source, which is appropriate for a spoken script.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It accurately transmits the technical content, preserves the conversational style of the podcast, and uses appropriate Spanish terminology. Minor fluency issues (some literal phrasing and a slightly formal register) prevent it from being perfect, but they do not affect the overall intelligibility or correctness. The work demonstrates careful attention to both the technical and communicative aspects of the source material.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.4 → rounded to 18/20."
