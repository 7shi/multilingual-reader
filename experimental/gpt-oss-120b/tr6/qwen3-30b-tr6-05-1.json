  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is fragmented, contains many unrelated filler lines (e.g., \"Hola\", \"El texto traducido al español es el siguiente.\") and abrupt topic jumps. A Spanish‑speaking reader cannot follow the dialogue or understand the flow of the podcast.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is riddled with unnatural constructions, repeated greetings, and placeholder sentences that do not belong to the original script. It does not read like natural Spanish.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Some technical terms (preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto) appear, but they are inconsistently used and often replaced by generic or missing content. No consistent handling of key concepts.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent of the original podcast – explaining pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning and memory features – is lost. Cultural or contextual adaptations are absent; the output inserts unrelated dialogue instead.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A large portion of the original dialogue is omitted or replaced by unrelated text (e.g., \"Hola\", \"Por favor, escribe en español\"). Essential explanations and examples are missing, making the translation incomplete.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "overall_comment": "The provided translation is far from acceptable. It appears to be a corrupted, partially automated output with many placeholders and missing content. It fails on readability, fluency, terminology handling, contextual fidelity, and completeness. A complete, coherent, and faithful translation would require a full rewrite of the entire script, preserving the conversational tone and technical explanations.\n\nGiven the severe deficiencies across all criteria, the translation scores very low overall.\n\n**Overall score (out of 20):** 2"
