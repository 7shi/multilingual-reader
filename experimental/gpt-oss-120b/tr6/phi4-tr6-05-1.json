    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows naturally and the ideas are presented in a clear, logical order. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia and aprendizaje en contexto are explained with simple examples that are easy to follow. Minor hiccups (e.g., a duplicated question line) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds like a native‑speaker conversation. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic (e.g., \"desciframos la tecnología\", \"una ventana de contexto\"). There are a few slightly odd choices – \"afinamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\", and the parenthetical \"(anclaje)\" after \"anclaje\" – but these do not break the fluency.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly rendered (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, ventana de contexto). The translation could improve consistency by using the more standard \"ajuste fino\" for fine‑tuning and by fixing the erroneous \"anclaje (anclaje)\" where the English term \"grounding\" should appear. Otherwise terminology is consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator has adapted cultural references and the conversational tone appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The explanation of memory features is clear and the analogy with a consultant works well. The only drawback is the duplicated question line, which slightly alters the original flow, but the overall intent remains intact.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the substantive information from the French script is present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. The only minor loss is the precise parenthetical translation of \"grounding\" and the extra duplicated question, which are small errors rather than omissions.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality: it conveys the technical content clearly, reads smoothly, and respects the original podcast’s informal, educational tone. Minor issues such as the redundant question line, the misuse of the parenthetical after \"anclaje\", and the choice of \"afinamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\" prevent a perfect score, but they do not significantly impair understanding. Overall, the work is accurate and effective for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nScore (average of the five criteria): 17 out of 20.\n\nThe translation would benefit from a brief editorial pass to correct the parenthetical term and eliminate the duplicated line, and optionally replace \"afinamiento\" with \"ajuste fino\" for greater technical precision."
