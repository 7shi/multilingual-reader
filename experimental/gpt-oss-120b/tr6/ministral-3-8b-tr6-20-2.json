  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the dialogue format is preserved, making the technical discussion accessible. A few long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but overall a French‑speaking audience would understand it without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary such as “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino” and “aprendizaje en contexto” is appropriate. There are slight awkwardnesses (e.g., “en vez de enviarlo a un programa de formación de años” instead of “de varios años”, mixed use of “podés”/“puedes”, and occasional formal‑informal shifts with “vuestras”), but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly: all key concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, window of context, short‑term memory) are translated with the accepted Spanish equivalents. Acronym “ICL” is retained and explained, preserving consistency throughout the script.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish‑speaking listeners (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenidos!”, “¡Gracias por habernos escuchado!”). Cultural references are neutral, and the explanatory analogies (consultant, bike‑riding) remain effective. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve flow, but the original intent is fully conveyed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No substantive information from the original French script is lost. All examples, analogies, and the distinction between temporary in‑context knowledge and permanent fine‑tuned knowledge are retained. The added Spanish‑specific punctuation and quotation marks do not alter meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It preserves the educational tone, keeps technical terminology accurate, and remains comprehensible for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor fluency refinements (sentence splitting, consistent pronoun usage) would push it to near‑perfect level, but the current version is already very effective for its intended purpose.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 17, Fluency 16, Terminology 18, Contextual Adaptation 17, Information Completeness 19. Total: 87/100.\n\nOverall, the translation succeeds in delivering the podcast’s content clearly and naturally, with only small stylistic adjustments needed for optimal polish."
