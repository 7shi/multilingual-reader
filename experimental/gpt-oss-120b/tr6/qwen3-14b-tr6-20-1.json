  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and follows a logical flow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the concepts are explained in an accessible way. A few long sentences could be broken up for easier reading, but overall a French‑speaking audience would understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly natural, but there are several spots that sound a bit forced or literal: \n- \"el afinamiento\" is not the usual term in Spanish (normally “ajuste fino”).\n- The French word \"ancrage\" is left unchanged instead of using the Spanish \"anclaje\" or \"enraizamiento\".\n- \"cheat sheet\" is kept in English.\nThese affect the smoothness for native speakers, though they do not break comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is largely preserved and correctly rendered (preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, aprendizaje en contexto). However, inconsistency appears with some terms left in the original language (\"ancrage\", \"cheat sheet\") and the translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"afinamiento\" rather than the more accepted \"ajuste fino\". The overall handling is acceptable but not optimal.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator keeps the original intent and tone of the podcast. Cultural references are mostly neutral, but a few expressions could be better adapted to Spanish‑speaking listeners (e.g., replacing \"cheat sheet\" with \"hoja de trucos\" and using a more idiomatic term for \"consultor brillante\"). The adaptation is good but not fully polished.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas or examples are omitted, and the logical sequence of the dialogue is preserved. Minor nuances such as translating \"cheat sheet\" are missing, but they do not affect the factual completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the technical content accurately and is easy to understand. The main weaknesses are occasional unnatural phrasing and inconsistent handling of certain borrowed terms. Improving the translation of a few key terms and fully localising expressions would raise fluency and terminology scores. As it stands, the translation is solid and functional for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts, but it could benefit from a final polish by a native‑speaker editor familiar with AI jargon.\n\n**Final rating:** 16/20 (average of the five evaluated criteria)."
