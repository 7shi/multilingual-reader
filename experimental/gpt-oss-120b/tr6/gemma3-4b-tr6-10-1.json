  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow; sentences are mostly well‑structured and the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are clear. A few long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are occasional awkward choices: *el afinamiento* (less common than *ajuste fino*), the parenthetical “(grounding)” left in English, and the redundant “Aprendizaje en Contexto con ICL”. These do not break understanding but reduce native‑speaker fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL*. The only notable lapse is the untranslated loanword *ancrage*; a Spanish equivalent (*anclaje* or *fundamentación*) would be preferable. Consistency is otherwise good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast tone, uses appropriate Spanish salutations, and adapts cultural references (e.g., “consultor brillante”) effectively. The overall intent and persuasive framing are well conveyed for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the original French script are present: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and the simulated “memory” features. No significant information is lost, and redundancies are minimal.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is solid and faithful to the source. It delivers the technical content clearly and maintains the conversational podcast style. Minor issues are the use of less‑common Spanish equivalents for some terms and occasional redundancy, but they do not impede understanding. With a few lexical tweaks (e.g., using *ajuste fino* and translating *ancrage*), the text would achieve a near‑perfect native feel.\n\nFinal rating: 17/20, reflecting good readability, accurate terminology, and strong contextual adaptation, with room for improvement in fluency and lexical precision.\n\nScore: 17"
