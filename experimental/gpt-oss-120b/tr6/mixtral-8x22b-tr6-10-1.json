  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the main ideas clearly and the flow of the conversation is easy to follow. Most sentences are understandable, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can grasp. However, the stray \"Final Translation:\" marker before one line and a few slightly clunky phrasing choices (e.g., \"memoria desechable\") interrupt the smoothness, preventing a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation reads naturally and uses appropriate Spanish vocabulary. There are occasional awkward constructions (\"memoria desechable\", \"el modelo en sí no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus conversaciones\") and the literal copy‑paste error mentioned above, which slightly reduce the feeling of native fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"anclaje\" are correctly rendered and used consistently throughout. The translation respects the jargon of AI without unnecessary simplification, which is excellent for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone well for a Spanish‑speaking audience, preserving the informal dialogue between Camille and Luc. Cultural references are neutral, and the explanations fit the likely knowledge level of listeners. Minor issues (the leftover English marker) keep it from a perfect rating.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French script are present in the Spanish version: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the discussion of \"memoria\" features. No substantive content is lost, though the stray marker slightly distracts from completeness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and faithfully reproduces the content and pedagogical tone of the original podcast. Technical concepts are well handled, and the conversation remains engaging for Spanish listeners. The main drawbacks are a copy‑paste artefact (\"Final Translation:\") and a few minor phrasing choices that feel a bit stiff. Fixing those would bring the translation very close to native‑speaker quality.\nOverall score: 83/100.\n\n**Strengths**: accurate terminology, clear explanations, good adaptation to the target audience.\n**Areas for improvement**: remove residual source‑language markers, smooth out a few awkward sentences, and ensure every line follows natural Spanish syntax.\n\n**Final rating**: 83/100."
