    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the same structure as the French original. However, there are several typographical and grammatical slips (e.g., “cantidad masiva”, “las conocencias”, mixed gender in “bienvenido/a”) and occasional awkward phrasing that can momentarily confuse the reader. The overall flow is preserved, but the occasional errors lower the ease of comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural expressions and inconsistencies: switching between \"tú\" and \"usted\", using \"Usted ha entendido todo\" in a context that was informal in French, wrong gender for \"IA\" (\"El IA\"), the nonsensical phrase \"el aprendizaje en contexto, es del cramar\", and punctuation errors. These issues make the text feel stilted and not fully native‑speaker quality.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly well‑handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"transferencia de aprendizaje\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"anclaje\" are appropriate. Some terms are left in the original language (e.g., \"prompt\") which is acceptable. Minor issues such as \"memoria de uso único\" instead of the more idiomatic \"memoria de un solo uso\" prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the intent of the original podcast script, but cultural and stylistic adaptation is uneven. The mix of formal and informal address, occasional literal translations (e.g., \"cramer\" instead of \"bachotear\"), and the retention of French‑style quotation marks reduce the naturalness for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French source are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. Small inaccuracies (e.g., mistranslating \"bachoter\" as \"cramar\") and occasional omitted nuances slightly affect completeness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the structure and most of the content of the original French podcast, but it is marred by a series of linguistic errors, inconsistent register, and awkward phrasing that hinder fluency and readability. Technical terms are largely correct, yet the overall polish expected for a native‑speaker audience is lacking. With careful proofreading and stylistic adjustments, the translation could reach a much higher quality level."
