  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logical and the dialogue flow mirrors the original. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto are explained clearly. A few very long sentences could be broken up for smoother reading, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, but there are occasional awkward turns (e.g., \"Cuando refinás un modelo\", \"una competencia permanente\", \"una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje contextual automatizado\"). The mix of voseo (\"refinás\") with other forms creates a slight inconsistency. Vocabulary is appropriate, yet a few phrases could be more idiomatic.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento (fine‑tuning)\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (Aprendizaje In‑Contexto)\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are all retained or translated correctly. The term \"prompt\" is left in English, which is common in the field, and the usage is consistent throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator successfully conveys the original intent and tone. Cultural references are preserved, and the analogy of a consultant and a student are adapted naturally to Spanish. Minor issues such as the phrasing \"¿Entonces es una trampa?\" (instead of a smoother \"¿Es entonces un truco?\") do not affect the overall message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No notable omissions or distortions are observed; the added note about the translation adjustment is outside the dialogue and does not affect content integrity.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the technical content clearly. Readability and terminology are strong points, while fluency could be refined by smoothing a few awkward expressions and ensuring consistent verb forms. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nScore summary: Readability 17/20, Fluency 16/20, Terminology 18/20, Contextual Adaptation 17/20, Information Completeness 19/20."
