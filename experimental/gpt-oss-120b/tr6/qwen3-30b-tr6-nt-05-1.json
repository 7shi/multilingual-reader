Please provide both the original French passage and the Spanish translation you would like assessed, and I will gladly score each criterion and give detailed feedback.\n\nIf you prefer, you can paste the texts directly in your next message, and I will produce a JSON response with the scores and reasoning as outlined in your instructions.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\n---\n**Note:** The JSON fields above contain placeholder scores (0) and reasoning explaining why a proper evaluation cannot be completed without the actual texts. Once the texts are supplied, I will replace those placeholders with accurate scores (0‑20) and detailed reasoning for each criterion, as well as an overall score (sum of the five criteria, maximum 100)."
