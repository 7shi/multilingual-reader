  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear, step‑by‑step manner. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained with simple analogies that are easy for a non‑technical audience to grasp. Minor punctuation quirks (e.g., occasional commas before “y”) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for native Spanish speakers. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, and most sentences are smooth. A few constructions are slightly literal (“enviar a este graduado a hacer una especialización”, “en lugar de enviarlo a hacer un programa de capacitación”) but they remain understandable and do not break fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, ICL, *prompt*. The decision to keep “grounding” and “prompt” in their English form is common in Spanish tech discourse and does not create confusion. The translation correctly preserves the meaning of each term.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator respects the original intent and adapts idiomatic expressions for a Spanish‑speaking audience (e.g., “chuleta” for cheat‑sheet). Cultural references are neutral, and the tone remains conversational and podcast‑like, matching the source’s style.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is retained. No sentences or ideas are omitted, and the added clarifications (like explaining *prompt* in italics) aid understanding without adding unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, reads smoothly, and adapts the conversational tone effectively for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor literal renderings could be refined for even greater naturalness, but they do not detract from the overall clarity and fidelity of the translation.\nScore: 92/100.\n\nStrengths: clear explanations, consistent terminology, faithful to original meaning, good cultural adaptation.\nAreas for improvement: smooth out a few slightly literal phrases and consider translating all English tech‑jargon when a well‑known Spanish equivalent exists (e.g., ‘grounding’ → ‘anclaje’)."
