  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and easy to follow. The dialogue format is preserved, and the explanations of complex AI concepts are understandable. Minor issues affect flow, such as occasional shifts between formal \"Usted\" and informal \"tú\" which can momentarily confuse the reader, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, with appropriate vocabulary for a tech‑focused podcast. A few constructions are slightly literal (e.g., \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\" and \"una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\") and sound a bit stiff for a conversational podcast. Overall, however, the text reads smoothly to a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\", etc. The acronyms (ICL) are kept, and the translation maintains consistency throughout. No major mistranslations of jargon are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral, and the style remains suitable for a French‑speaking audience now addressed to Spanish speakers. The only drawback is the mixed level of formality, which slightly reduces the natural podcast feel.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No sentences are omitted or altered in meaning, and the explanations remain complete. The translation adds no unnecessary redundancy and keeps the content concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. Readability and terminology are strong points, while fluency and consistency of register could be refined slightly. The occasional formal‑informal shift is the main area for improvement, but it does not detract significantly from the listener's understanding. The translation would serve well for a Spanish‑speaking tech podcast audience with only minor polishing needed.\n\n**Total score (out of 100): 84**\n\n**Strengths:** accurate terminology, complete information, clear explanations. **Areas for improvement:** maintain a consistent informal tone throughout the dialogue and smooth out a few literal phrasing choices.\n\n**Final rating:** 84/100, indicating a high‑quality translation with room for minor stylistic enhancements."
