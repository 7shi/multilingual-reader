  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and conveys the main ideas. Sentence structures are mostly logical, but there are occasional grammatical slips (e.g., “cuando le presentar” instead of “cuando le presenta”, misuse of plural “Ustedes” in a dialogue that should be informal singular). The use of the French‑derived word “bachotage” is not explained, which can hinder comprehension for readers unfamiliar with the term.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, yet several expressions feel literal or awkward: “Ustedes entendieron todo”, “el afinamiento”, and the missing verb conjugations break the flow. Vocabulary is appropriate, but the occasional French calque reduces the feeling of native Spanish prose.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”. The choice of “el afinamiento” for fine‑tuning is acceptable, though “ajuste fino” would be more common. The term “bachotage” is left untranslated, which may confuse non‑French speakers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent but does not fully adapt to Spanish‑speaking audience conventions. Formal‑informal pronoun usage is inconsistent, and some phrasing remains too literal from French, reducing cultural resonance.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is retained. No major ideas are omitted, and the explanations remain intact. Minor stylistic redundancies are present but do not affect content delivery.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the technical content accurately and keeps the structure of the original podcast script. Strengths lie in the faithful transmission of concepts and proper use of most technical vocabulary. Weaknesses are mainly grammatical errors, occasional unnatural phrasing, and insufficient adaptation to Spanish linguistic norms (e.g., pronoun choice, untranslated French terms). With a careful proofreading and slight re‑phrasing, the text could reach a higher level of fluency and readability.\n\n**Final score (out of 100): 81**"
