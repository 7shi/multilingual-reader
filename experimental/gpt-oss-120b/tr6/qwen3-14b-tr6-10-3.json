  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured, the dialogue flow mirrors the original, and complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained clearly. Minor punctuation quirks do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and the conversational tone is preserved. A few passages feel slightly literal (e.g., “una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”), but they are still understandable and do not break fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje (grounding). Acronyms are kept, and the Spanish equivalents are the standard ones used in the field.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the podcast’s informal, explanatory style and adapts cultural references (e.g., “consultor brillante”) appropriately for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Slightly more colloquial alternatives could be used in a couple of spots, but overall the intent and tone are well preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memoria” features. No significant information is omitted or added unnecessarily.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the original’s conversational tone, and is readable and fluent for Spanish‑language audiences. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve naturalness, but they do not detract from the overall effectiveness.\nOverall score (out of 100): 90/100."
