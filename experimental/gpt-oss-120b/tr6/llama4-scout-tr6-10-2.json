  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the technical ideas are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can understand. Minor punctuation quirks (extra quotation marks) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, but there are a few noticeable slips: the duplicated speaker label \"Luc: \\\"Luc:\"\", unnecessary opening quotes after the colon, and occasional literal renderings (e.g., keeping \"prompt\" in English). These reduce the overall smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje). The terminology is consistent throughout and appropriate for a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent, adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., \"consultor brillante\"), and keeps the conversational tone of a podcast. No cultural mis‑steps are evident.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present; no substantive information is lost. The only issues are formatting errors, not content omissions.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original material accurately and understandably. It handles technical vocabulary well and preserves the podcast’s lively style. Minor editorial mistakes (duplicate speaker tags, stray quotation marks, occasional Anglicisms) prevent a perfect score but do not significantly impair the listener’s experience.\n\nStrengths: clear explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning; consistent terminology; faithful to the original message.\n\nWeaknesses: small typographical/formatting errors and a few unnaturally literal choices that affect fluency.\n\nThe translation is solid and would be readily usable after a brief proofread to clean up the speaker labels and punctuation.\n\nScore (average of the five criteria): 18/20"
