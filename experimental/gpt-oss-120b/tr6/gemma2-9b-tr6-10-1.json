  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally understandable and follows the logical flow of the original dialogue. However, there are occasional awkward phrasings (e.g., \"Imaginen que se envía una nueva IA a una escuela para darle un conocimiento básico\" and \"Vea usted:\") and a few grammatical slips (\"los palabras\"). These issues slightly hinder smooth comprehension for native readers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds fairly natural, but several constructions feel literal or unidiomatic. Examples include \"Vea usted\", \"simplemente aprende los palabras\", and inconsistent use of \"afinamiento\" vs \"afianzamiento\". Such errors break the natural flow, though the overall meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"anclaje\". The main weakness is inconsistency in translating \"fine‑tuning\" – it appears as both \"afinamiento\" and \"afianzamiento\", which could confuse readers. Apart from that, terminology is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural adaptation is minimal but adequate. Minor issues such as the formal \"Vea usted\" and occasional literal translations slightly reduce the naturalness for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas, examples, and analogies from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is omitted, and the dialogue remains faithful to the source. Minor stylistic redundancies exist but do not affect completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the content accurately and retains the educational tone of the podcast. While the meaning is intact and most technical vocabulary is handled well, the text suffers from occasional grammatical errors, inconsistent terminology, and some unidiomatic phrasing that affect readability and fluency. A careful proofread and consistent use of \"afinamiento\" for fine‑tuning would raise the quality considerably.\nOverall rating (average of criteria): 15/20.\nSuggested improvements: standardize technical term translations, correct grammatical slips, and replace formal or literal constructions with more natural Spanish expressions.\n\nScore out of 20 points (overall): 15"
