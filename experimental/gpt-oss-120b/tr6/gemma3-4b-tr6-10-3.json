  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow; sentences are well‑structured and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto) are clear. A few minor hiccups (e.g., “hola y bienvenido/a” with mixed gender) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic, and the dialogue flow feels like a podcast. Small awkwardness appears in phrases like “una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”, but overall it sounds smooth.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, ventana de contexto, ICL, etc. The only notable lapse is keeping “ancrage (grounding)” untranslated; a Spanish equivalent such as “anclaje” would be preferable. Consistency is otherwise good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original’s informal podcast tone, using common Spanish interjections (¡Exactamente!, ¡Una analogía perfecta!). The occasional use of formal “usted” could be softened to “tú” for a more colloquial feel, but the intent and cultural relevance are maintained.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas from the French source are present; no significant content is omitted or altered. Supplemental explanations are faithful to the original and no redundancy is introduced.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains readable and fairly natural, and stays true to the podcast’s explanatory style. Minor issues with a few untranslated terms and slight formality choices keep it from being perfect, but they do not detract substantially from the listener’s understanding.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20.\n\nScore: 17"
