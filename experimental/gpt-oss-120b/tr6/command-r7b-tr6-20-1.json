    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the dialogue flow mirrors the original. Minor typographical issues (e.g., “competentepero”) and occasional awkward phrasing do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several expressions that feel forced or non‑idiomatic for native speakers (e.g., “informaciones específicas”, “ancoraje”, inconsistent use of “vosotros/ustedes”). These reduce the overall smoothness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly kept (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje en contexto), but some are mistranslated or poorly chosen: “ancoraje” instead of the more common “anclaje”, and a serious conceptual error where fine‑tuning is described as a form of in‑context learning. This harms technical accuracy.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator captures the general intent of the podcast, but several nuances are lost or altered. The answer to the memory question is re‑phrased differently from the original, and extra explanatory sentences appear that were not in the source. Cultural adaptation is adequate, but fidelity to the original discourse is compromised.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original information is present, yet the key segment about how fine‑tuning works is incorrectly rendered, turning it into a description of in‑context learning. This misrepresentation is a significant omission/ distortion of the source content. Some redundancy is added, while a few details are omitted.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the general spirit of the podcast and is readable for Spanish‑speaking listeners, but it suffers from notable inaccuracies in technical explanations and terminology. The mischaracterisation of fine‑tuning and the use of non‑standard terms like “ancoraje” undermine its reliability for an audience seeking a precise understanding of AI training methods. Fluency is acceptable, though occasional awkward phrasing and typographical errors lower the polish. Overall, the translation is functional but would need revision to correct the technical errors and improve naturalness.\n\n**Overall Score (out of 20)**: 12"
