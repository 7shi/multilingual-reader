    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is understandable overall, but the excessive use of quotation marks and the repetition of the speaker’s name inside the quotes (e.g., \"Camille: \"Hola…\") creates visual clutter and interrupts the flow. Some sentences are a bit clunky (e.g., “Es pues una memoria de uso único”). These issues lower readability for a native reader.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural, but the unnecessary quotation marks, occasional awkward phrasing (“Una ayuda justo antes de que comience a hablar con usted”) and a few minor grammatical slips (missing commas, inconsistent use of accents) make it feel less smooth than a native‑crafted script.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL”. The term “fine‑tuning” is kept in English within quotes, which is acceptable, and “grounding” is rendered as “anclaje”. Consistency is good, though “perfeccionamiento” for “affinage” is less common than “ajuste fino”.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and explains the concepts clearly for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral and appropriate. The main drawback is the formatting (quotes) that feels out of place for a podcast transcript.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version; no major ideas are omitted and the sequence of dialogue is intact. Minor typographical quirks do not affect the conveyed content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full meaning of the original French podcast and uses suitable technical vocabulary. However, the formatting with superfluous quotation marks and occasional awkward phrasing detracts from readability and fluency. Cleaning up the speaker labels and smoothing a few sentences would raise the overall quality considerably.\nOverall score (out of 20): 15"
