  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clearly expressed. Most sentences are logical and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. Minor issues such as occasional misplaced quotation marks and occasional long, dense sentences slightly reduce smoothness, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several inconsistencies and awkward constructions: mixed use of \"tú\" and \"usted\", occasional Spain‑specific \"vuestras\" mixed with Latin‑American \"tus\", and clunky phrasing like \"una forma inteligente de aprendizaje automático por contexto automatizado\". These quirks make the text feel slightly stilted for a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" and \"memoria mejorada\" are correctly rendered and used consistently. The occasional retention of English acronyms (ICL, In‑Context Learning) is appropriate for the domain.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and explanatory style. Cultural adaptation is adequate, though the inconsistent register (formal vs. informal) and the literal carry‑over of some French‑style quotation marks slightly affect the naturalness for Spanish‑speaking audiences.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No relevant segment is omitted, and the added quotation marks do not change the meaning. The content remains complete and faithful to the original.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and maintains the educational tone. It excels in preserving technical content and completeness, but it suffers from minor fluency issues and register inconsistencies that prevent it from feeling completely natural to native Spanish readers. A light edit to harmonize pronoun usage and smooth out a few clunky phrases would raise the quality substantially.\n\n**Overall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20**\n\n**Final score**: 17"
