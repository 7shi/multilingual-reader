  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version presents the concepts in a clear, logical order. Sentences are generally well‑structured, and the dialogue format is preserved, making it easy for a Spanish‑speaking audience to follow the discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and memory features. A few very long sentences could be split for extra clarity, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary (e.g., “ventana de contexto”, “memoria”, “chuleta”). Minor awkwardness appears in phrases like “La IA no tiene «olvidado»” (should be “no ha olvidado”) and occasional mixing of “Ustedes” with informal tones, but these do not break fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently and correctly. The translator kept the English loanwords in parentheses where useful (fine‑tuning, ICL, grounding) and supplied accurate Spanish equivalents. Concepts such as “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ajuste fino” and “aprendizaje en contexto” are rendered precisely.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately. The metaphor of a consultant and the analogy of cramming for an exam are preserved and make sense in Spanish. The only slight cultural mismatch is the use of “chuleta” which is colloquial but widely understood in many Spanish‑speaking regions.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive ideas are omitted, and the dialogue maintains the same flow. Redundancies are minimal, and the translation does not add unnecessary content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational tone of the podcast, and is mostly natural for Spanish readers. Minor stylistic tweaks (splitting long sentences, correcting a few awkward phrases) would push the score even higher, but the current version is already excellent for both lay and technically‑savvy audiences.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.2/20, rounded to 18/20.\n\nRecommended improvements: adjust the phrase \"La IA no tiene «olvidado»\" to \"La IA no ha \"olvidado\"\" and consider a more consistent use of formal pronouns throughout the script.\n\nScore (overall): 18"
