  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are short and the flow mirrors the original French dialogue, making the concepts understandable for a non‑expert audience. A few minor phrasing issues (e.g., “para que aprenda una cultura general” instead of “para que adquiera una cultura general”) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are occasional awkward constructions (“presentárselo a una cantidad mucho menor de texto”, “área de trabajo vacía”). These are noticeable to native speakers, though they do not break the overall readability. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"pré‑entraînement\" is kept with its French form (acceptable in a tech podcast), \"fine‑tuning\" becomes \"afinamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are accurate, and \"grounding\" is translated as \"anclaje\". The terminology is consistent throughout the script.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references and idioms appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience (e.g., “consultor brillante”). Minor issues such as using \"área de trabajo\" instead of the more common \"espacio de trabajo\" are present, but the original intent and tone are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is retained. No key points are omitted, and the dialogue structure is preserved. The translation even includes the parenthetical clarifications present in the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is strong. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational tone of the podcast, and is largely readable and natural. The few grammatical oddities prevent a perfect score, but they do not detract significantly from understanding. The work demonstrates solid bilingual competence and good handling of specialized terminology.\n\nStrengths: faithful content transfer, consistent terminology, clear exposition of complex ideas. \nAreas for improvement: smooth out a few awkward phrasings and consider fully localizing certain loanwords (e.g., replace \"pré‑entraînement\" with \"pre‑entrenamiento\").\n\nOverall score: 89/100 (equivalent to ~17.8/20 per criterion)."
