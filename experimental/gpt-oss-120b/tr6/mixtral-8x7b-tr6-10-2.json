  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish output is a jumble of dialogue, meta‑comments, code snippets and editor notes. Sentences are often truncated or duplicated, making it hard for a reader to follow the conversation. Logical flow is broken, so comprehension requires extra effort.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Numerous unnatural constructions appear (e.g., \"¡Eso está exactamente!\", \"Sprintf(Resposta, ...)\"), inconsistent use of names (Luc vs Lucas), and awkward literal translations. Vocabulary choices sometimes feel stilted or out‑of‑place for a podcast script.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are present, but their usage is inconsistent (e.g., \"AIC\" instead of ICL, \"ventana de contexto\" vs \"memoria a corto plazo\"). Some terms are mistranslated or left in English, reducing precision.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation does not fully preserve the original intent or register. Conversational tone is lost amid explanatory brackets and editorial remarks. Cultural references are unchanged, but the added meta‑information distracts the target reader.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is present, but many sections are omitted, duplicated, or replaced by system messages (e.g., \"User: Only output the Spanish translation\"). Important explanatory parts are sometimes missing, while irrelevant notes are retained.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "overall_comment": "The submitted translation is far from a publishable version. It mixes the final Spanish script with the intermediate translation workflow, resulting in low readability, poor fluency, and inconsistent terminology. While the core technical concepts are recognizable, the presence of meta‑text and formatting errors makes the piece unsuitable for the intended podcast audience without extensive editing and cleaning.\n\nA thorough rewrite is needed: strip all system prompts, unify speaker names, correct grammar, smooth phrasing, and ensure consistent use of technical terms.\n\nOverall quality is low and would require major revision before use.\n\nScore out of 100: 32/100 (sum of the individual criteria)."
