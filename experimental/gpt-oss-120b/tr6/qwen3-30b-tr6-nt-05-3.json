  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "I cannot assess readability because the original French text and the Spanish translation are missing. Without seeing the sentences, I cannot judge whether the Spanish version is clear, logically organized, or easy for target‑language readers to understand.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Fluency and naturalness can only be judged by examining the actual Spanish output. Since no translation has been provided, I am unable to determine if the phrasing sounds native, if any constructions are awkward, or whether the vocabulary is appropriate.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Evaluating technical terminology requires knowledge of the domain‑specific terms used in the French source and how they were rendered in Spanish. The texts are not available, so I cannot comment on consistency, adequacy, or the need for explanations.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Contextual adaptation involves checking whether the translator preserved the original intent, adapted cultural references, and optimized expressions for Spanish‑speaking readers. Without the source and target texts, this cannot be measured.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "I need to compare the French source with the Spanish version to verify that no information has been omitted, added unnecessarily, or altered. Since the materials are absent, I cannot evaluate completeness.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "I am unable to perform the requested evaluation because the French source text and its Spanish translation were not provided. Please supply both the original passage and its translation, and I will gladly score each criterion (readability, fluency, terminology, contextual adaptation, and information completeness) with detailed reasoning and a final overall assessment."
