  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version flows logically and the sentences are easy to follow. Complex ideas are explained clearly, and the conversational tone matches a podcast script. Minor hiccups (e.g., “en lugar de enviarlo a hacer un programa…”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for native speakers. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary; only a few constructions feel slightly stiff, such as “Se puede decir eso” instead of a more idiomatic alternative. Overall the text reads smoothly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto” and the abbreviation ICL are correctly rendered. The English loan “grounding” is left untranslated, which is acceptable in a technical context, but a Spanish equivalent could have been offered.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts the style to a Spanish‑speaking audience (informal “tú” consistent with a podcast). Cultural references are unchanged, which is appropriate, and the overall tone remains engaging.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present; no content has been omitted or altered. The translation also avoids unnecessary redundancy while keeping the explanations complete.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical concepts accurately, reads naturally, and is well adapted to a Spanish‑language podcast audience. Minor stylistic tweaks could raise fluency a point or two, but overall it is an excellent rendering of the original French script.\nOverall score (out of 100): 92/100.\nThe strengths lie in faithful terminology handling and completeness; the only room for improvement is smoothing a few slightly awkward phrasing choices.\n\nOverall rating: 4.6/5 (Excellent)."
