    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and easy to follow. The sentences convey the original ideas, and complex concepts are explained in a straightforward way. Minor issues such as the clumsy \"Hola y bienvenidos/as\" and occasional missing accents (e.g., \"mas\" vs \"más\") slightly affect smoothness, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, but there are a few literal renderings that feel awkward to a native speaker: \"ventana de contexto\" is acceptable but a bit literal, the mixed use of English terms with asterisks (\"*fine‑tuning*\"), and some long sentences that could be split. Overall the flow is good, yet these small hiccups prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is handled well. Key terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\", \"grounding (anclaje)\" and \"memoria a corto plazo\" are correctly translated and consistently used. The occasional retention of English words (fine‑tuning) is acceptable in a technical podcast context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the target audience, using appropriate Spanish phrasing and cultural conventions. The inclusive \"bienvenidos/as\" shows an attempt at gender neutrality, though it feels a bit forced. Overall the intent, tone, and style of the original podcast are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The only minor loss is the subtle nuance of \"mémoire\" functionality, which is still conveyed accurately.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly to Spanish‑speaking listeners. While a few literal phrases and minor stylistic choices slightly reduce naturalness, the terminology is accurate, the content complete, and the overall message stays faithful to the original. Minor polishing would bring it to an excellent level.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 87/100."
