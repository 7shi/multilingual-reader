  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow; sentences are mostly short and the logical flow mirrors the original. Minor punctuation quirks (extra quotation marks, speaker labels repeated) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic, and most constructions are smooth. A few phrases feel slightly stiff (e.g., retaining English word *prompt*, occasional redundant quotes), but they do not break fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto* and the abbreviation ICL are all kept. The occasional use of English words like *prompt* is acceptable in a technical podcast context, and the term *grounding* is clarified with the Spanish equivalent *anclaje*.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the conversational tone of a podcast for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogy of a consultant works well. Minor issues such as duplicated speaker tags do not affect the intended message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent knowledge distinction, and the explanation of “memory” features. No substantive content is lost.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content clearly, maintains the podcast’s engaging style, and uses appropriate terminology. Small typographical and punctuation irregularities are the only noticeable flaws, but they do not detract from overall comprehension or accuracy.\nOverall score: 18/20."
