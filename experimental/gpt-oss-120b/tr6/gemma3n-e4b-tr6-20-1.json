    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in simple sentences. Some sentences are a bit long and the occasional typo (e.g., “Tranformers”) slightly hampers flow, but overall a native reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, using appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic structures. There are a few minor awkward phrases (“Se puede decir eso”, “Y basándonos en esta reflexión”) and a mix of registers (formal \"usted\" versus informal \"vuestras\"), which prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: «pré‑entraînement» → \"pre‑entrenamiento\", «fine‑tuning» → \"ajuste fino\", «transfer learning» → \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", «In‑Context Learning» → \"aprendizaje en contexto\", etc. The term *prompt* is left in English, which is acceptable for a technical audience. Consistency is good throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original podcast tone and purpose, and it adapts cultural references appropriately. However, the register fluctuates (mix of \"usted\" and \"vuestras\"), and a few expressions could be more idiomatic for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The overall intent is preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is retained. No essential detail is omitted, and the translation does not introduce unrelated content. Minor typographical issues do not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency and contextual adaptation could be refined to achieve a more consistent register and smoother phrasing. Minor typographical errors and occasional register shifts are the main drawbacks, but they do not impede comprehension. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a technical podcast audience.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 17/20."
