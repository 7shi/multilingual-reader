  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logical and the dialogue flow mirrors the original. Minor issues appear with the translation of “pré‑entraînement” as “aprendizaje previo”, which is understandable but less precise, and occasional mixed registers (e.g., “vuestra” vs. “tu”). Overall, a native reader would comprehend the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward constructions: “la ampliación masiva de la memoria de corto alcance” is less idiomatic than “memoria a corto plazo”, the use of “afináis” (vosotros) clashes with the predominantly “tú” style, and occasional over‑use of exclamation marks. Vocabulary is appropriate, yet the inconsistency in pronoun usage slightly disrupts fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled well (fine‑tuning, transfer learning, grounding). The biggest deviation is the rendering of “in‑context learning (ICL)” as “aprendizaje por contexto, o AIC”, which is not the standard Spanish acronym and may confuse readers. “Prompt” is left untranslated, which is acceptable. Overall terminology is adequate but not perfectly consistent.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the conversational tone and the pedagogical intent of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral, and the adaptation to Spanish listeners is effective. Small mismatches in register (mix of “tú” and “vosotros”) slightly affect cohesion, but the overall purpose and style are preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines from the original are present, and no substantive information is lost. The explanation of memory functions, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the analogy with consultants are fully retained. Only minor stylistic nuances differ, not the content itself.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and maintains the educational, conversational tone of the podcast. While readability and completeness are strong, fluency and terminology suffer from a few non‑idiomatic choices and an unconventional acronym for in‑context learning. Minor register inconsistencies also affect smoothness. Overall, the translation is good but could be refined for a more natural Spanish technical discourse.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15.2 → rounded to 15 out of 20."
