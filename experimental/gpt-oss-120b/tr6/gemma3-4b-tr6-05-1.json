    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and follows a logical flow. Most sentences are easy to understand, and complex concepts are explained in an accessible way. Minor issues affect readability: mixed gender in \"bienvenido/a\", the French word \"bachotage\" left untranslated, and the phrase \"en las entrañas\" which sounds odd in Spanish. These do not block comprehension but slightly reduce smooth reading.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most parts, but a few expressions are awkward or literal translations. Examples include \"Hola y bienvenido/a\", \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es como bachotage\" (mixing French), and \"inserta automáticamente estas extractos en el prompt, en las entrañas\" which is not idiomatic. Overall fluency is good but not fully native.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\", \"anclaje\" for grounding, etc. The word \"prompt\" is kept in English, which is acceptable in current AI jargon. The only notable lapse is retaining the French term \"bachotage\" instead of a Spanish equivalent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast tone and adapts cultural references appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The opening greeting could be smoother, and the literal \"en las entrañas\" feels out of place, but the overall intent and style are retained.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present; no sentences or ideas are omitted. The translation conveys the same explanations, analogies, and conclusions. Minor stylistic choices do not result in loss of meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the original content accurately, with clear explanations of AI concepts. Minor lexical and stylistic issues—especially the leftover French term and a few unnatural phrases—prevent it from being fully native‑like, but the overall quality is high and understandable for the target audience.\n\nStrengths: faithful content, appropriate technical terminology, good overall readability. Areas for improvement: eliminate non‑Spanish borrowings, refine idiomatic phrasing, and adjust gender‑neutral greetings.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 78/100, indicating a good translation that would benefit from a final polish by a native speaker.\n\nScore: 78"
