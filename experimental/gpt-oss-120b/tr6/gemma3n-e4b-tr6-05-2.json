  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are conveyed clearly. Minor typographical errors (e.g., *gradúado*, *reaprendir*, *rfine*) and occasional awkward phrasing do not break comprehension, but they require a second reading for full clarity.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several unnatural expressions and spelling mistakes that make the translation feel less smooth for a native speaker: *Transformeers*, *gradúado*, *reaprendir*, *informaciones*, *hacer trampa* for « bachotage », and the use of *sillón* instead of *sillín* or *silla*. These reduce the natural flow, even though most sentences are correctly structured.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL* are correctly kept. However, a few terms are either misspelled (*Transformeers*) or mistranslated (*hacer trampa* instead of « bachotage »). The overall handling of terminology is solid but not perfect.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, adapting the conversational style well for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Small cultural mismatches (e.g., overly formal *usted* vs. informal *tú*) and the inaccurate rendering of « bachotage » slightly weaken the adaptation, but the message remains intact.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key information from the French script is present; no major ideas are omitted. The only drawback is the nuance loss when « bachotage » is rendered as “hacer trampa”, which slightly alters the meaning. Apart from that, the content is complete.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is functional and conveys the technical concepts well, but it suffers from several typographical and lexical errors that affect fluency and precision. A careful proofread and a more faithful rendering of certain idioms (especially « bachotage ») would raise the quality significantly. The translation is understandable and technically accurate in most parts, yet it needs polishing before being published as a professional podcast script.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14.4 → 14/20."
