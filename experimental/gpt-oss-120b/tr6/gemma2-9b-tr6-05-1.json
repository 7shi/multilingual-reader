  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the original structure, but several instances of code‑switching (e.g., “C’est donc una memoria…”, “Merci por escucharnos”) interrupt the flow. The informal “abres” vs the rest of the formal register is inconsistent, and a few sentences are literal translations that feel clunky. These issues make the passage slightly harder for a native Spanish reader to follow.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences read naturally, but the mixed French fragments and occasional literal phrasing (“una habilidad permanente”, “Se olvida de todo”) make the translation sound artificial in places. Vocabulary is appropriate, yet the presence of French words reduces the overall smoothness.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, grounding → anclaje, etc. Consistency is good and the terms suit a non‑expert audience. Minor lapses (French words left in) do not affect the technical terminology.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and explanatory tone of the original are preserved, and cultural references are adapted (e.g., “consultor” vs “consultante”). However, the residual French expressions detract from a fully localized Spanish version.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memoria” features. No substantive information is omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and handles the technical vocabulary well. The main weaknesses are the occasional mixing of French and Spanish and a few slightly awkward phrasings that affect readability and naturalness. Cleaning up the code‑switching and smoothing out literal translations would raise the overall quality significantly.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
