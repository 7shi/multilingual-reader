  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text conveys the original ideas clearly and the flow of the dialogue is easy to follow. Minor formatting issues (duplicate speaker tags, occasional stray asterisks) and a few punctuation quirks do not hinder comprehension, but they slightly lower the smoothness of reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural, but there are several awkward constructions: \"Camille: **Camille:**\", \"Luc dice: 'Exactamente…'\", the use of \"ancraje\" instead of the more common \"anclaje\", and the inconsistent handling of quotation marks. These oddities make the translation feel a bit mechanical for a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is largely preserved and correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning (kept in English, which is acceptable in a tech context), aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), etc. The term \"grounding\" is translated as \"ancraje\", which is understandable though not the most common choice. Overall the terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish (e.g., \"Buenos días\" instead of \"Bonjour\") and retains the educational intent. Small mismatches such as the accidental \"Camila\" instead of \"Camille\" and the occasional English fragment slightly weaken cultural alignment, but the overall purpose is well preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the essential information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the examples (English‑to‑French transfer, memory vs. fine‑tuning) are retained. Minor typographical errors do not affect content completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion effectively. It would benefit from polishing the formatting, correcting a few speaker‑name inconsistencies, and smoothing out some stilted phrasing, but the core message, terminology, and educational value are intact.\n\nOverall, the work is good enough for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts, requiring only light editing for a more polished final product.\n\nScore (out of 100): 84/100."
