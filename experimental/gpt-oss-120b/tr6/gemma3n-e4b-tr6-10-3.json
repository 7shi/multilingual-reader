  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the concepts are explained clearly. Most sentences are easy to follow, though occasional long sentences and a few typographical errors (e.g., “recodar”, “rfine”, “Transformeers”) slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, using appropriate colloquial Spanish (e.g., “consultor brillante”). However, there are a handful of awkward constructions and typos (\"vuestras\" vs. \"tus\", capitalisation of \"Memoria\", missing accents) that a native speaker would notice.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL) and anclaje are correctly rendered. Minor inconsistencies such as the misspelling “rfine” do not affect comprehension but reflect a lapse in precision.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone and educational purpose. Cultural references are irrelevant, so no adaptation was needed, and the examples (consultant analogy, bike‑riding) work in Spanish. Small typographic errors slightly reduce the polished feel.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original. The only loss is accidental – the typo \"recodar\" – which does not change meaning but is a minor flaw.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and maintains the educational tone. It is readable and technically sound, but a few typographical mistakes and occasional unnatural phrasing prevent it from being fully polished.\n\nScore breakdown: readability 16, fluency 14, terminology 17, contextual adaptation 15, information completeness 18. The average yields an overall score of 16 / 20.\n\nRecommendation: a quick proofread to correct typos (recodar, rfine, Transformeers) and smooth out minor awkward constructions would raise the fluency to near‑native level.\n\nOverall score (out of 20): 16"
