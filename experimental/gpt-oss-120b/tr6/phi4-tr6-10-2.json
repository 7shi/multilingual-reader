    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Most sentences convey the original ideas without requiring extra effort from the reader. However, a few expressions are awkward (e.g., \"cursar apuros para un examen\") which may momentarily confuse a native speaker. Overall, the content is comprehensible and the flow is logical.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, using appropriate colloquial language for a podcast. Minor unnatural phrasing (\"cursar apuros\", \"una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje contextual automatizado\") slightly breaks the smoothness, but these do not severely impede understanding. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". The translation keeps the English acronyms where needed and maintains consistency throughout. No major terminology errors are observed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and conversational style suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are minimal, and the few idiomatic expressions used are mostly fitting, though some could be refined. The overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No sentences or concepts have been omitted, and the structure mirrors the source closely, ensuring full transmission of the content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency suffers from a few clumsy phrases that could be polished. The adaptation respects the podcast format and retains the original meaning. Minor stylistic tweaks would bring it to a near‑perfect level.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
