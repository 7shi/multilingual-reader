  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are clear and the logical flow of the podcast dialogue is preserved. Minor issues such as inconsistent quotation marks and occasional awkward punctuation slightly impede smooth reading, but the core ideas remain comprehensible.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few expressions feel literal (“prompt”, “Memoria” capitalized, mixed English‑Spanish quotes) and some phrasing could be smoother. Overall, a native speaker would understand it without major effort.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled appropriately: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (In‑Context Learning)”. The word “prompt” is left untranslated, which is acceptable for a technical audience, and the translation keeps consistency throughout.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent, tone, and podcast style are well conveyed. Cultural references are neutral, and the translation adapts the consultant metaphor appropriately (“consultor”). Minor stylistic quirks (e.g., quotation style) do not affect the overall message.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present. No substantive information is omitted, and the translation does not add irrelevant material. The only loss is the occasional loss of formatting nuance, which does not affect meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The French‑to‑Spanish translation is solid and faithful, delivering the technical content clearly and maintaining the conversational podcast vibe. Small inconsistencies in punctuation, occasional English leftovers, and a few literal renderings keep it from being perfect, but they do not hinder comprehension. With minor polishing, it would read as a fully native‑level transcript.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
