  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained in simple terms. A few long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but overall the comprehension level is appropriate for a podcast audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are a handful of awkward or incorrect expressions: “El aprendizaje en contexto, es cramado” (the verb *cramado* is a literal borrowing and feels out of place), “una antiche” (a misspelling of *una antiche* or better *una chuleta*), and occasional missing accents or commas. These hiccups prevent a fully native‑like flow.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *transfer learning* (aprendizaje por transferencia), *ventana de contexto*, *ICL* and *grounding* are kept consistent, with the English loanwords retained in quotation marks where appropriate. The translation respects the level of technical detail required for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original intent, tone, and podcast style. Cultural references are neutral, which is suitable for a francophone‑to‑hispanic audience. Minor issues (e.g., the odd word *antiche*) slightly reduce the adaptation quality, but the overall message is conveyed accurately.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the logical flow of the discussion is maintained. The only drawback is the typographical error *antiche*, which could momentarily confuse the reader.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and faithful to the source, delivering the technical content in a clear, accessible way. Minor lexical slips and a few unnatural phrasings keep it from being perfect, but the overall quality is high and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience.\n\nStrengths: accurate terminology, complete information, clear explanations.\nWeaknesses: occasional unnatural word choices and a typo that break fluency.\n\nOverall, the work demonstrates good competence in both languages and in handling specialized material, with room for polishing the naturalness of expression.\n\nScore (out of 100): 81/100.\n\nRecommendations: replace *cramado* with a more idiomatic phrase (e.g., *intenso* or *a presión*), correct *una antiche* to *una chuleta* or *una hoja de trucos*, and review punctuation/accents for a fully native feel.\n\nScore Summary: 81/100 (Readability 16, Fluency 14, Terminology 18, Contextual 15, Completeness 18)."
