  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are generally clear, and complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in plain language. A few constructions are slightly clunky (e.g., “No necesita reaprender lo que es un verbo”), but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary choices are appropriate, and the conversational tone of a podcast is preserved. Minor issues include unnecessary commas (\"El aprendizaje en contexto, es empollar\") and the use of \"el afinamiento\" which is less common than \"ajuste fino\"; nevertheless the overall flow is smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje (grounding), etc. The translator kept the original acronyms and provided parenthetical explanations where needed, matching the expected technical level of the audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French podcast style to Spanish well – greeting with \"Buenos días\", using familiar colloquialisms like \"chuleta\" for \"antisèche\", and preserving the consultant metaphor. Cultural references are appropriate and no tone is lost.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the original script is present. No ideas or examples are omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is maintained. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy nor leave gaps.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical concepts accurately, retains the engaging podcast tone, and is largely natural and readable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but the text is functionally excellent and complete.\n\n**Overall score (average)**: 18/20"
