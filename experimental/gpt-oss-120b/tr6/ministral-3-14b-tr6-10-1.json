  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the concepts are explained in a way that a non‑specialist audience can understand. Minor issues such as a missing opening exclamation mark and a few long sentences do not significantly hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, but there are occasional literal renderings and slight grammatical slips (e.g., “Suele percibirse a estas IA”, “el afinado” instead of “el ajuste fino”, missing opening \"¡\"). These quirks make the text feel a little less smooth for a native speaker.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly: “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, etc. English acronyms and terms are kept in parentheses, which is appropriate for a tech‑focused audience. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of the podcast script. Cultural references are neutral and suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor phrasing choices (e.g., “consultor puntual”) deviate slightly from the original but do not alter the meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No relevant detail is omitted, and no superfluous content is added. The translation faithfully reproduces the full dialogue.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is very good. It conveys the technical content accurately and is largely readable and natural for Spanish speakers. A few grammatical and stylistic tweaks would raise the fluency to a near‑perfect level, but the core message and terminology are solidly preserved.\n\nStrengths: accurate terminology, complete transfer of information, clear exposition of complex ideas. \nAreas for improvement: polish minor grammatical errors, replace literal phrases like “el afinado” with more idiomatic equivalents (“el ajuste fino”), and ensure proper punctuation for exclamations.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.2 / 20."
