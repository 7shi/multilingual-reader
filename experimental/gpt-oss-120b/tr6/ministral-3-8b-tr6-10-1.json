  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the dialogue format is preserved. Most sentences are clear, but there are a few awkward phrasings (e.g., \"las informaciones de las que tiene necesidad\", \"la gran pregunta para quien utilice estas herramientas\") and a typo (\"cramar\" instead of \"empollar\" or \"cram\"). These issues slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly sounds natural, but several expressions are unidiomatic: \"las informaciones\", missing accent in \"quién\", and the typo \"cramar\". Some sentences are overly literal, giving a stilted feel (e.g., \"Es una observación excelente y es clave entender cómo funciona\"). Overall, a native speaker would notice these hiccups.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje\" are appropriate and consistent throughout. No key term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone of a podcast conversation. Minor cultural‑linguistic slips (typos, missing accents) reduce the polish, but the overall message and style are retained.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present. No sections are omitted or significantly altered. The only loss is the slight nuance introduced by the \"cramar\" typo, which does not affect factual content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does an excellent job preserving the technical content and conversational structure of the original podcast. It would benefit from a careful proofread to correct typographical errors, adjust a few unidiomatic phrases, and add missing accents, which would raise its fluency and readability to a native‑like level.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 16/20.\n\nStrengths: accurate terminology, complete information, faithful conveyance of intent.\nAreas for improvement: minor typographical errors, unidiomatic word choices, and occasional missing diacritics.\n\nScore: 16/20"
