    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and complex concepts are explained in an accessible way. Minor issues such as the isolated fragment \"El preentrenamiento.\" slightly affect flow but do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, with appropriate idiomatic expressions. A few constructions are a bit awkward (e.g., \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje automatizado en contexto\", \"una chuleta\"), but they do not break the overall smoothness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"In‑Context Learning (ICL)\". The translation of \"grounding\" as \"enraizamiento\" is uncommon; \"anclaje\" would be more standard. The English word \"prompt\" is left untranslated, which is acceptable for a technical audience but could have been adapted. Consistency is otherwise good.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone well (\"Buenas tardes\", informal examples, use of \"consultor brillante\"). Cultural references are preserved and the informal word \"chuleta\" fits the conversational style. Overall, the intent and register of the original are conveyed effectively.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as in the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and keeps the lively podcast style, making the material approachable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor terminology choices and occasional phrasing quirks prevent a perfect score, but they do not detract from overall comprehension or usefulness.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 17.6 ≈ 18/20."
