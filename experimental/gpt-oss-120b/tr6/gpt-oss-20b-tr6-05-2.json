    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are mostly clear and the logical flow of the dialogue is preserved. A few long sentences could be broken up, but the concepts remain understandable for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most part. Some literal renderings (e.g., “la expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo de la IA, o la ventana de contexto”) feel a bit stiff, and occasional phrasing such as “documentos de información exactos” is slightly awkward. Nonetheless, a native speaker would have no trouble comprehending it.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje (grounding) and memoria a corto plazo are all retained or translated consistently. The colloquial “bachotaje” is a deliberate choice to keep the original analogy, and it does not hinder understanding.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., “consultor brillante”). It respects Spanish‑speaking listeners while preserving the original intent. Minor issues such as the literal use of French‑style guillemets (« ») could be replaced with Spanish punctuation, but they do not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present. No sentences or ideas are omitted, and the dialogue structure is kept intact. The translation also avoids unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational tone, and is largely readable and natural for Spanish speakers. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but the translation succeeds in delivering the full meaning of the original podcast script.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 18, Fluency 17, Terminology 19, Contextual Adaptation 18, Information Completeness 20. The average yields an overall rating of 18/20.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18.4 → rounded to 18."
