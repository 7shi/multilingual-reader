  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas without excessive complexity, and the explanations of concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia y aprendizaje en contexto are understandable for a non‑expert audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation sounds natural, but there are a few awkward word choices and literal constructions (e.g., \"Lo has comprendido todo\", \"afianzamiento\" for fine‑tuning, mixing \"puesta a punto\" and \"afianzamiento\"). These do not break comprehension but slightly reduce the flow for native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly correct (preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, ventana de contexto). However, the translation of \"fine‑tuning\" is inconsistent – it appears as \"puesta a punto\" and later as \"afianzamiento\", a term that is rarely used in this context. Consistency and a more common term like \"ajuste fino\" would improve the translation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the original intent, tone, and style of the podcast dialogue. Cultural references are adapted appropriately (e.g., \"instituto\" for \"school\"). The only minor issue is the occasional literal rendering of French idioms, but overall the adaptation feels suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, la diferencia entre conocimiento temporal y permanente, y la explicación de la función \"Memoria\". No substantive information is omitted, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original message accurately and is largely readable for Spanish listeners. The main drawbacks are inconsistent terminology for fine‑tuning and a few slightly unnatural phrasings. With a more consistent use of technical terms and minor stylistic tweaks, the translation would reach a near‑native quality level.\n\nOverall, the work is solid and functional, suitable for a podcast audience, scoring 83 out of 100.\n\nScore: 83/100"
