  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow; sentences are generally well‑structured and the complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) are explained clearly. A few long sentences could be split, but overall a native‑speaker would understand without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places and uses appropriate colloquial style (e.g., \"¡Lo han pillado todo!\"). Minor awkwardness appears: the French word *extraits* is left untranslated, and some phrasing such as \"El aprendizaje por transferencia es la clave. Miren:\" feels a bit stilted. These do not break comprehension but reduce smoothness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled expertly: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)*, *ventana de contexto*, *anclaje*, etc., are all correctly rendered and consistent. The occasional retention of the English word *prompt* is acceptable in a tech‑focused podcast.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts idioms for a Spanish‑speaking audience (e.g., \"empollarse\", \"chuleta\"). However, \"chuleta\" is regional slang that may not be universally understood, and the French *extraits* is left untranslated, which slightly hurts cultural adaptation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning, the explanation of memory vs. temporary knowledge, and the description of \"memoria\" features. No substantive content is omitted.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, reads mostly naturally, and is comprehensible to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor lexical slips (retaining French words, regional slang) keep it from being perfect, but they do not impede understanding.\n\nStrengths: faithful rendering of technical concepts, clear explanations, good use of colloquial Spanish where appropriate. Areas for improvement: replace remaining French terms with Spanish equivalents, consider more universally understood vocabulary for \"chuleta\" (e.g., \"antidote\" or \"hoja de referencia\").\n\nScore out of 100: 89/100."
