  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear order. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto are explained with examples that are easy to follow. Minor hiccups (e.g., “Se puede decir eso.”) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural to a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and sentences are well‑structured. A few expressions feel slightly literal (“El aprendizaje en contexto en acción.”, “Se puede decir eso.”) but they remain understandable and do not break the naturalness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento (fine‑tuning)”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “anclaje (grounding)”. The English acronyms are retained and explained, ensuring consistency throughout the dialogue.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French intent to a Spanish‑speaking audience effectively. Cultural references are neutral, and the explanatory tone is preserved. Small stylistic tweaks could improve readability (e.g., “aprendizaje en contexto automatizado” instead of “aprendizaje contextual automatizado”), but the overall adaptation is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original script is present. No key points, examples, or analogies have been omitted, and the added parenthetical notes keep the meaning intact. The translation is concise without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains readable, and generally sounds natural in Spanish. Minor phrasing choices prevent a perfect score, but they do not affect the overall understanding. The translator succeeded in preserving the pedagogical tone of the podcast while using appropriate terminology and clear explanations.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.4 → 18/20."
