  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and follows a logical flow. Most sentences are easy to understand, and the complex concepts are explained in a straightforward way. Minor issues such as occasional redundant articles (e.g., “las informaciones”) and the presence of markup (**Camille**) slightly hinder smooth reading, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds fairly natural, but a few constructions feel literal or stiff (e.g., “Usted lo ha entendido perfectamente”, “le da las informaciones”). Some punctuation and spacing inconsistencies also give a slightly non‑native impression. Overall, a native speaker would understand it without effort, though a few tweaks would improve fluidity.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: preentrenamiento, afinamiento/fine‑tuning, transferencia de aprendizaje, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding, etc. The translator kept the English acronyms where appropriate and used consistent Spanish equivalents, which is suitable for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts the style to a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the rhetorical question about “consultor temporal o experto permanente” works well. Minor literal renderings (e.g., “una gran expansión de la memoria a corto plazo”) could be smoothed, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No essential points are omitted, and the added formatting markers do not affect the conveyed content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency and stylistic polish could be improved with minor edits. The translator has maintained the educational tone of the podcast and kept the technical details intact, making it a reliable Spanish rendition of the original French script.\n\nStrengths: accurate terminology, complete information, clear explanations.\nAreas for improvement: smoother phrasing in a few sentences, removal of residual markup, and minor article adjustments for more natural Spanish.\nOverall, a high‑quality translation with only small refinements needed.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 86/100."
