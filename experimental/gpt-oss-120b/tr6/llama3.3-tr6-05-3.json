    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly short and the logical flow mirrors the original French script. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in plain language, making the content accessible to a non‑expert audience. A few sentences are a bit long (“Cuando abres una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío…”) but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, but there are several spots where the wording feels slightly forced or literal. Examples: “Entendieron todo.” should be “Entendieron” or “Lo entendieron”; “enraizamiento” is not the usual term for “grounding” in Spanish AI jargon (\"anclaje\" or \"referenciación\" would be better); the phrase “es una forma astuta de aprendizaje automatizado en contexto” is a bit clunky. These minor awkwardnesses keep the fluency from being perfect.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly handled correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”. The translation of “fine‑tuning” as “afinamiento” is understandable, though “ajuste fino” is more common. The translation of “grounding” as “enraizamiento” is not standard and may confuse readers familiar with AI literature. Consistency is good, but a few terms could be improved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The tone of a podcast conversation is preserved, and the Spanish version adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., using “¡Buenas tardes!”). The script remains engaging for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor issues such as the overly literal translation of some idioms do not significantly affect the intended impact.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary nature of prompt‑provided knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features as a retrieval trick. No important information is omitted, and no extraneous material is added.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and maintains the educational, conversational style of the podcast. While the overall comprehension is solid, a few lexical choices (especially for technical terms) feel literal and slightly unnatural. Minor stylistic tweaks would bring the fluency up to native‑speaker level, but the text is functional and informative as it stands.\n\nOverall rating: 16/20."
