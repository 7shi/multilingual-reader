    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version follows the conversational flow of the original and most sentences are clear and easy to understand. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in plain language. A few sentences are slightly verbose (e.g., the long analogy about the consultant) but they do not hinder comprehension. The only minor hiccup is the repeated bicycle analogy, which can cause momentary confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation reads naturally and uses appropriate vocabulary for a tech‑savvy podcast audience. Most idioms are well chosen (\"es como contratar a un consultor brillante\", \"una memoria de un solo uso\"). There are a few awkward turns – “memorizado” for \"bachotage\" and the redundant phrase \"Es como aprender a montar en bicicleta\" appearing twice – but they do not severely break fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" and \"grounding\" are all preserved or explained. The translation keeps the original English acronyms and uses Spanish equivalents where appropriate. Consistency is maintained throughout the script.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the content well for Spanish‑speaking listeners, preserving the podcast tone and the pedagogical style. Cultural references are neutral, so no mis‑alignments appear. The only slight issue is the literal translation of \"bachotage\" as \"memorizado\", which is understandable but less idiomatic than \"bachotaje\".",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key points of the original dialogue are present: the distinction between pre‑training and fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent nature of knowledge, and the explanation of the new \"Memoria\" feature. The duplicated bicycle line is a minor error, and a few tiny nuances (e.g., the exact term for \"prompt\") are left in italics, but the overall information is intact.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality, conveying the technical content clearly and naturally for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor issues such as a repeated sentence, a slightly odd word choice for \"bachotage\", and occasional verbosity keep the score from being perfect, but they do not detract significantly from the listener's understanding. The translator demonstrates strong command of both languages and of the subject matter.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 88"
