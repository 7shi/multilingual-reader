  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas, and complex concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. The only drawback is the occasional long sentence and the mistaken acronym “ACL” that could confuse readers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most of the script. Vocabulary is appropriate and the phrasing sounds like native Spanish. Minor awkwardness appears in a few places (e.g., “memoria a corto plazo de IA”, “ACL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”), but they do not break the flow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"ventana contextual\" are well rendered. The term \"fine‑tuning\" is translated as \"afinamiento\", which is acceptable, but the acronym for In‑Context Learning is incorrectly changed to ACL, which is a notable inconsistency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience smoothly, preserving the podcast tone and using culturally neutral expressions. The proper nouns and brand names are kept unchanged, which is appropriate. Minor issues are limited to the acronym error.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present. No significant content is omitted or added. The only slight loss of precision is the wrong acronym, but the factual statements remain intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is very good. It captures the educational tone of the podcast, explains the AI concepts clearly, and remains faithful to the source. The main imperfections are the inconsistent acronym (ICL turned into ACL) and a few minor phrasing quirks. These do not severely affect comprehension, but correcting them would bring the translation to a near‑perfect level."
