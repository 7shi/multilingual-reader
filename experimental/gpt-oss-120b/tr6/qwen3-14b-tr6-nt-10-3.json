    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas and the logical flow is preserved. A few long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but overall a native Spanish reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several expressions that sound unnatural or overly formal for a podcast script (e.g., “Usted lo ha entendido todo”, “Se tiene la impresión”). Some punctuation errors (missing opening exclamation marks) and slightly awkward phrasing (“se le ha proporcionado simplemente una pista justo antes de que comenzara a hablarle”) reduce the natural flow. Nonetheless, the translation is largely comprehensible.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “anclaje”. The occasional use of the original English term in parentheses helps clarity. Consistency is maintained throughout the text.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and tone of a conversational podcast. It uses Spanish‑appropriate wording, though the mix of formal “Usted” and informal “tú” could be more consistent. Cultural references are preserved, and the script remains engaging for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present. No key ideas, examples, or analogies have been omitted, and the structure mirrors the original. Redundancies are not introduced, and the content stays concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. Readability and completeness are strong points. Fluency suffers from occasional overly formal or clunky phrasing, and a more consistent voice would improve the listening experience. Technical terminology is well‑handled, and the contextual adaptation is appropriate for a podcast audience.\n\nThe translation would benefit from a light edit to smooth out formal/informal inconsistencies and to add the missing opening punctuation marks, but it is already very usable.\n\nFinal overall score (average of the criteria): 17/20.\n\nScore: 17"
