  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the main ideas clearly and follows a logical flow. Most sentences are easy to understand, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in plain language. A few minor hiccups (e.g., the redundant \"Luc:\" tags and the typo \"La IA no se afinada\") slightly disrupt comprehension, but they do not prevent the reader from grasping the content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation reads naturally, but there are occasional awkward constructions and grammatical errors. Examples include \"La IA no se afinada\" (incorrect verb form), \"expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo de la IA\" (a less idiomatic phrasing), and inconsistent use of bold tags. These issues make the text feel a bit stilted for a native speaker.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally handled well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are correctly translated and used consistently. The abbreviation ICL is kept, which is appropriate. A minor point is the use of \"competencia\" for \"skill\"; \"habilidad\" would be slightly more precise, but the meaning is clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts the examples to a Spanish‑speaking audience without losing nuance. Cultural references are neutral, and the explanatory tone is preserved. Minor formatting artifacts (e.g., duplicated speaker labels) detract a little but do not affect the conveyed message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the logical sequence of the dialogue is intact. Redundancies are minimal, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the technical content effectively. While the majority of the text is clear and uses appropriate terminology, a few grammatical slips and formatting leftovers prevent it from being fully polished. With minor edits to correct the verb form, smooth out a couple of phrasing choices, and clean up the speaker tags, the translation would reach a near‑perfect level of fluency and readability.\n\n**Overall score (average)**: 18/20"
