  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the technical concepts are explained clearly with familiar examples (e.g., comparing fine‑tuning to a university degree). The only minor hiccup is occasional long sentences, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but a few expressions are awkward. The use of the French word *bachotage* instead of a Spanish equivalent and the choice *ancaje* (less common than *anclaje*) feel out of place. Small punctuation issues also reduce smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *transferencia de aprendizaje*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL*, *grounding* are all rendered appropriately. Consistency is maintained throughout the script.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts cultural references suitably for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The analogies (consultant vs. expert) are kept, and the tone remains conversational and engaging.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No relevant information is omitted. All examples, analogies, and explanations from the French version appear in the Spanish version, and no extraneous content is added.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is faithful and largely clear, conveying the technical discussion without loss of meaning. Fluency could be improved by replacing a few non‑Spanish borrowings (*bachotage*, *ancaje*) with more natural equivalents, but otherwise the text is high‑quality and ready for a podcast audience.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
