    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure, but there are several awkward phrasings (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en”, inconsistent use of “Usted”/“tú”, and the French word “incroyablement” that remains untranslated). Minor grammatical slips such as “conocencias” instead of “conocimientos” slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences feel unnatural for a native speaker. The mix of formal and informal registers, literal translations (“Usted ha entendido todo.”) and occasional French remnants break the flow. Nonetheless, the overall message is clear and the language is not incomprehensible.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, ventana de contexto, etc., are correctly rendered and consistent. The only minor issue is the occasional French word left in the text.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and explanatory style, but cultural/linguistic adaptation is uneven. Formality shifts and some non‑idiomatic expressions (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en”) reduce the natural fit for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the logical progression of the discussion remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full content and technical concepts accurately, but its readability and fluency suffer from several non‑idiomatic expressions, inconsistent register, and a few leftover French words. Terminology is solid, and no information is lost, yet a native‑speaker revision would be needed to smooth out the language and ensure a consistent tone throughout the podcast script.\nOverall score reflects an average performance with room for improvement in naturalness and style.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 15/20.\nScore out of 20: 15\n"
