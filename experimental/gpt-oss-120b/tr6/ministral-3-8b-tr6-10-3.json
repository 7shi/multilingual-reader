    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and the dialogue flows, making the concepts understandable. However, the word **cramar** is not Spanish (should be “empollar” or “estudiar intensivamente”), which can confuse readers. Some sentences are a bit literal (“Envían a una IA…”) but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are occasional literal renderings and awkward phrasing (e.g., “Miren cómo funciona”, “es una forma astuta”). These hiccups prevent the text from feeling completely smooth to a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje, etc. Consistency is maintained. Minor quibble with “memorización” instead of the more common “memoria”, but the meaning is clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original intent to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using appropriate analogies (consultor, bicicleta). The only cultural mismatch is the non‑existent verb “cramar”. Otherwise the tone and purpose are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present; no ideas are omitted or added unnecessarily. The dialogue, examples, and explanations are fully retained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is accurate and faithful to the source, conveying the technical content effectively. Minor lexical errors (notably “cramar”) and some slightly stilted phrasing keep it from being perfect, but it remains highly understandable and useful for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nScore: 86/100"
