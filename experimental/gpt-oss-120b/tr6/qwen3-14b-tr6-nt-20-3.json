    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall easy to follow and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. Most sentences are clear, and complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in understandable language. Minor typographical errors like “informaciónes” slightly disrupt smooth reading, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds fairly natural, yet a few expressions are awkward or literal: “se le dio una trampa” (instead of a more natural “una pista” or “una antisècha”), “Vean esto” feels a bit forced, and the use of “afinado” for fine‑tuning is uncommon in Spanish. The occasional typo and the presence of guillemets « » also make the text feel less polished.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “grounding (anclaje)”. The term fine‑tuning is rendered as “afinado”, which is understandable though “ajuste fino” would be more idiomatic; nevertheless the meaning stays clear. Consistency across the script is maintained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone and educational purpose. The dialogue style is kept, and cultural references are neutral enough to work for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Small mismatches (e.g., “una trampa” instead of a more natural “una antisècha”) prevent a perfect adaptation, but the overall message is conveyed effectively.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and no unnecessary additions are made. The only loss is the minor typo, which does not affect the factual content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. Readability and terminology are strong points, while fluency suffers from a handful of literal renderings and minor typographical errors. With a few stylistic tweaks (especially around colloquial expressions and the fine‑tuning term), the text would read as completely natural Spanish.\nOverall score: 86/100.\nThe translation is suitable for an informed audience but could be refined for a smoother native‑speaker experience.\n\n**Breakdown**: Readability 17, Fluency 15, Terminology 18, Contextual Adaptation 16, Information Completeness 20.\n**Total**: 86/100."
