    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the flow of the conversation is preserved. Minor issues such as the phrasing “¿Es decir?” and occasional redundancy do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few literal renderings break the flow (e.g., “Vean ustedes”, “el afinamiento”, retaining English “cheat sheet”, and the French term “ancrage”). These choices feel slightly awkward to a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly identified and largely kept consistent (preentrenamiento, transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL). However, some terms could be rendered with more common Spanish equivalents (e.g., “ajuste fino” instead of “afinamiento”, “anclaje” for “grounding”). The mix of languages (French, English) slightly reduces precision.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent, tone, and examples are preserved, making the translation appropriate for the target audience. A few culturally‑neutral expressions (e.g., “cheat sheet”) remain untranslated, which slightly hinders full adaptation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the ideas, examples, and nuances from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is omitted, and the technical explanations remain intact.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the original content well. It is readable and complete, but it suffers from occasional literalness and mixed‑language terminology that affect naturalness. Minor revisions—especially replacing a few anglicisms/French terms with their Spanish equivalents—would raise fluency and terminology scores.\n\nStrengths: faithful to source, clear structure, retains technical depth. Weaknesses: some literal phrasing, retained foreign terms, occasional awkward constructions.\n\nThe translation is solid for an informed audience, but polishing the language would make it sound more native‑like.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria, rounded): 17/20."
