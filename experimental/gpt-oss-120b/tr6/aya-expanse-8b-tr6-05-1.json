  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable; the main ideas and explanations are clear. However, the duplication of speaker tags (e.g., \"Camille: **Camille:**\"), occasional misplaced punctuation, and a few awkward literal translations slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several non‑natural constructions: the use of \"Luc dice:\" inside the dialogue, the mix of English terms (fine‑tuning, ICL) without Spanish equivalents, and occasional odd phrasing (\"Ella lee enormes cantidades de datos\", \"no ha olvidado en el sentido humano\"). These make the text feel a bit stilted for native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly well‑handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje\". The term \"fine‑tuning\" is left in English instead of the usual Spanish \"ajuste fino\" or \"fine‑tuning\", which is a minor inconsistency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, and cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only notable slip is the change of the name \"Camille\" to \"Camila\" in one line, which is a small but visible error.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of the \"Memory\" feature. No substantive information is omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and keeps the overall structure of the podcast dialogue. Formatting issues, a few unnatural phrasing choices, and minor inconsistencies (speaker label duplication, an occasional name change, untranslated technical terms) prevent it from being fully polished, but the core message is clear and complete.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
