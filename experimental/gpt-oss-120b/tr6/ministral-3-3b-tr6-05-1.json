  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. However, there are several mixed‑language fragments (e.g., “Bonjour y bienvenido/a”, “Tech Flash” vs. “Tech Éclair”) and occasional missing articles or punctuation that slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound a bit stilted or contain awkward constructions (“Y soy **Luc. Hoy vamos a desvelar**…”, “Luc: **afinamiento**”, “El aprendizaje en contexto es como memorizar”). The use of bold/italics and occasional English words (prompt) also breaks natural Spanish fluency.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, grounding). The translation of “fine‑tuning” as “afinamiento” is acceptable but less common than “ajuste fino”. Some terms like “prompt” are left untranslated without explanation, leading to slight inconsistency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent, but cultural/linguistic adaptation is uneven. Opening greeting mixes French and Spanish, and the podcast name changes inconsistently. These choices reduce the sense that the text is fully adapted for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present: pre‑training, transfer learning, fine‑tuning vs. in‑context learning, the notion of temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No essential information is lost.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core ideas of the podcast episode and is largely complete, but it suffers from mixed‑language artifacts, occasional unnatural phrasing, and inconsistent handling of technical terminology. A careful proofread to eliminate French remnants, smooth out awkward sentences, and standardize technical terms would raise the quality considerably.\nOverall the work is good enough to be understood, yet it feels like a draft rather than a polished, native‑speaker‑level translation.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14/20."
