    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas mirrors the original French. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia e aprendizaje en contexto are explained in simple terms, making them accessible. Minor issues (occasional missing punctuation, a few long sentences) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward spots: “en lugar de reentrenar la IA para hacerla especialista” (a more idiomatic phrasing would be “para convertirla en especialista”), the retained French word “requête”, mixed use of “tus”/“vuestras”, and occasional literal constructions that feel stiff. These reduce the overall smoothness for a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, etc. Consistency is good. The only small drawback is the retention of the English phrase *transfer learning* instead of a Spanish equivalent, which is acceptable but slightly less optimal.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone, and adapts the content for a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, the presence of the French word “requête”, the shift between “tus” and “vuestras”, and occasional region‑specific pronouns slightly weaken the cultural adaptation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No relevant detail is omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is preserved.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and clearly. It succeeds in explaining technical concepts in an understandable way and retains the conversational style. Minor fluency hiccups, a few untranslated French remnants, and inconsistent pronoun usage prevent it from reaching a perfect score, but the content is complete and technically sound. With a quick edit to remove the French word and smooth out a couple of phrasing choices, it would read as fully native Spanish.\n\nFinal rating: 86/100."
