  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the concepts are explained clearly. Sentences are well‑structured, making it easy for a Spanish‑speaking audience to follow the discussion about pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia y aprendizaje en contexto.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic, though a few phrases are slightly literal (e.g., \"la ampliación masiva de la memoria a corto plazo\" and \"el aprendizaje en contexto es bachotaje\"). These do not impede comprehension but slightly reduce the native feel.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, ICL, anclaje, ventana de contexto, etc. The translator kept English acronyms and provided Spanish equivalents where needed, ensuring the specialist terminology remains accurate.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references well (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", \"analógica perfecta\"). It respects the podcast tone and makes the content relatable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor literal renderings are present but do not affect the intended meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is preserved. No sentences are omitted or altered in a way that changes meaning, and the explanatory details (e.g., how la \"Memoria\" funciona) are fully retained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the original message accurately, uses appropriate technical language, and is largely readable and natural for Spanish listeners. Minor stylistic tweaks could make it sound a bit more idiomatic, but the content is clear and complete.\nScore breakdown: 18 (readability) + 17 (fluency) + 19 (terminology) + 18 (contextual adaptation) + 20 (information completeness) = 92/100.\nThe translation would be very well received by the target audience with only minimal polishing needed.\n\nOverall rating: 92/100.\n\n---\n**Detailed reasoning per criterion**\n- **Readability (18/20)**: Clear exposition, logical flow; occasional long sentences could be split for easier reading.\n- **Fluency (17/20)**: Natural language overall; a few literal choices slightly affect the native feel.\n- **Terminology (19/20)**: Technical vocabulary is accurate and consistently applied.\n- **Contextual Adaptation (18/20)**: Cultural adaptation is good; tone matches a podcast format.\n- **Information Completeness (20/20)**: No loss of meaning; all details retained.\n\nThe translation is strong and only needs minor stylistic refinements to achieve near‑perfect fluency.\n\n---\n**Total score**: 92"
