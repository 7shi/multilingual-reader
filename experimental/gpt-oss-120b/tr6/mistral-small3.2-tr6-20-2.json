  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version follows the original flow and explains the concepts clearly. Sentences are generally well‑structured, making the content easy to follow for a non‑expert audience. Minor hiccups (e.g., the use of “consigna” for “prompt”) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, with idiomatic expressions such as “es como contratar a un consultor brillante”. A few word choices are slightly awkward or overly literal (e.g., “consigna” instead of a more common “entrada” or “prompt”, “chuleta” which is colloquial and region‑specific). These do not break the text but slightly reduce the smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, anclaje, etc. Consistency is maintained throughout. The only small issue is the translation of “prompt” as “consigna”, which is acceptable but less common in AI literature.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts well to a Spanish‑speaking audience (greeting “Buenos días”, use of familiar analogies). Cultural references are appropriate, though the word “chuleta” is a colloquialism mainly used in some Latin American countries and might not be universally understood. Overall intent and tone are preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and nuances from the original French script are present in the Spanish version. No essential information is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately and understandably. Minor lexical choices (e.g., “consigna”, “chuleta”) could be refined for broader neutrality, but they do not impair the overall quality. The text remains engaging and faithful to the original podcast script.\n\nOverall score (sum of the five criteria): 86/100."
