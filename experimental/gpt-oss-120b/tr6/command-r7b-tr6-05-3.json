    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally easy to understand. Sentences follow a logical order and complex ideas are explained clearly. Minor issues such as the insertion of “Camille dice que” (which is redundant) and a Portuguese spelling error “informações” instead of “información” slightly affect smooth reading, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and the conversational tone is preserved. Some expressions are a bit awkward for native speakers (e.g., “ancoraje” instead of the more common “anclaje”, missing articles in “se convierte en contexto”). These quirks lower the fluency slightly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, etc. Consistency is good, and the translator keeps the jargon accessible. The only notable slip is the use of “informações” and “ancoraje”, which are not the standard Spanish equivalents.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the original intent and tone, adapting the greeting to a Spanish‑speaking audience without losing the educational purpose. No cultural missteps are present, and the conversational flow is kept intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the logical progression of ideas is preserved. Minor formatting differences (the final “* **Camille**” line) do not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid. It conveys the technical concepts accurately and keeps the podcast’s conversational style. Minor lexical slips (Portuguese spellings, less‑common terms) and a few syntactic hiccups prevent it from being perfect, but the content is clear, complete, and largely natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\nScore: 85/100 (average 17/20 per criterion)."
