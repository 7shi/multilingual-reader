  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version flows logically and the ideas are easy to follow. Sentences are generally clear, and complex concepts are explained in an accessible way. Minor typographic issues (e.g., spacing around « pre‑entrenamiento ») do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, but a few literal choices feel odd to native speakers: «afinamiento» instead of the more common «ajuste fino», the retained French word «antisèche», and some punctuation quirks. These reduce the overall smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, etc., are correctly rendered. The choice of «afinamiento» is acceptable, though not the most idiomatic, and «anclaje» for grounding is adequate. Consistency is maintained.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original podcast are preserved, but cultural adaptation is limited. Retaining the French word «antisèche» and using «consultor brillante» are acceptable, yet a more Spanish‑centric term (e.g., «chuleta») would feel more natural. Overall, the adaptation is good but not optimal.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present. No key points are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The content remains faithful to the original.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the technical content effectively. Readability and completeness are strong points. Fluency and cultural adaptation could be improved by replacing a few literal borrowings with more idiomatic Spanish equivalents. The technical terminology is handled competently, making the text suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nFinal score (out of 100): 86/100."
