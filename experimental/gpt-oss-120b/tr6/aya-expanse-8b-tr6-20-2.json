    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the conversational flow of the original. However, there are several formatting artifacts (extra quotation marks, asterisks, and an odd “Camille: ” prefix) that interrupt the reading flow. Some sentences are long and could be broken up for better clarity, and the gender‑neutral “bienvenida/o” sounds awkward.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly uses natural Spanish vocabulary, but a few expressions feel forced or literal (“referenciación” for grounding, “Hola y bienvenida/o”). The presence of markdown markers (** **) and inconsistent punctuation makes the prose sound less smooth. Overall, a native speaker would understand it, but it does not read as a polished, fluent script.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto” and “Aprendizaje en Contexto (ICL)” are correctly rendered. The term “afinamiento” is introduced later after using “especialización”, creating inconsistency. “Grounding” is translated as “referenciación”, which is not the usual term in Spanish NLP literature (normally “anclaje” or “grounding”). The term “prompt” is kept in English, which is acceptable for a technical audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural references are neutral, and the conversational style is kept. Minor issues (e.g., the gender‑neutral greeting and the literal translation of “consultant”) slightly reduce the natural adaptation, but overall the message is conveyed correctly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the content from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is omitted, and the technical explanations are retained. The only drawbacks are typographic artifacts that do not affect the factual content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in delivering the full technical content and maintains the educational, conversational tone of the podcast. Nevertheless, it suffers from formatting leftovers, occasional awkward phrasing, and some inconsistent terminology. A revision to clean up the markup, improve natural phrasing (especially for gendered greetings and the term “grounding”), and ensure consistent use of technical terms would raise the quality significantly.\nOverall score (out of 100): 75/100.\nThe translation is good but needs polishing for fluency and terminology consistency.\n\n**Breakdown**: Readability 14/20, Fluency 13/20, Terminology 15/20, Contextual Adaptation 15/20, Information Completeness 18/20.\n\n**Recommendation**: Edit the script to remove markdown symbols, replace “referenciación” with a more common term like “anclaje”, and adjust gender‑neutral expressions to sound natural in Spanish. Consistently use either “afinamiento” or “especialización” for fine‑tuning throughout the text."
