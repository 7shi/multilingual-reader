  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable. Sentences are generally short and follow the original flow, making the concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning clear. However, a few long, repetitive blocks (especially the duplicated translation note) make the text harder to follow, and occasional missing punctuation slightly hampers smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural constructions: “describir el mundo en general” (instead of “el funcionamiento del mundo”), “ventana de contexto” is acceptable but the phrase “expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo de la IA” sounds forced, and the duplicated translation note (“**Traducción final:**”) breaks the narrative. Vocabulary is mostly appropriate, but the style is a bit stilted compared with native podcast transcripts.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”. Some inconsistencies appear, such as leaving the French word “grounding” untranslated and mixing English “prompt” within Spanish sentences. Overall, the terminology is adequate for a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone of a conversational podcast. Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is needed. Nevertheless, the inclusion of the translation‑note brackets and occasional literal renderings (e.g., “una antisèche”) feel out of place for Spanish listeners, slightly reducing the natural adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are present: the analogy of university graduate, the contrast between fine‑tuning and in‑context learning, the memory‑feature explanation, and the consultant vs. expert metaphor. No substantive information is omitted, though the duplicated block adds redundancy without adding new content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of preserving the technical content and overall structure of the original podcast. It is generally readable and complete, but suffers from occasional awkward phrasing, redundant translation notes, and minor inconsistencies in terminology that prevent it from feeling fully natural to native Spanish speakers. Minor editing to remove duplicated sections and smooth out literal constructions would raise the quality substantially.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
