  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are clear and the flow mirrors the original dialogue, making the concepts understandable for a non‑expert audience. Minor issues such as the hyphenated “pre‑entrenamiento” (normally written *preentrenamiento*) and occasional long sentences slightly affect smoothness, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward constructions: “cuando *fine‑tuneas* un modelo” mixes English verb with Spanish suffix, and the repeated parenthetical “(Aprendizaje en Contexto)” is redundant. The use of asterisks around *prompt* and *fine‑tuning* feels like a literal carry‑over from the source rather than a Spanish‑style rendering. Overall, a native speaker would understand it, though a few expressions feel forced.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely handled correctly: *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL*, and *grounding* rendered as *anclaje*. The decision to keep English terms like *fine‑tuning* and *prompt* is acceptable in a tech‑focused podcast, but a Spanish equivalent (*ajuste fino*, *solicitud*) could improve consistency. The translation maintains consistent use of the chosen terms.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. It adapts gender‑inclusive language appropriately (\"bienvenidos/as\"). Cultural references are neutral, so no mis‑alignments appear. Minor typographic choices (hyphenation, asterisks) are the only departures from optimal adaptation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and the logical sequence of the dialogue is retained. Redundancies are minimal and do not obscure meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. Readability and completeness are strong, while fluency and some stylistic choices could be refined. Technical terms are appropriate, though occasional reliance on English forms prevents the text from feeling fully natural in Spanish. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for the intended podcast audience, with room for minor polishing of idiomatic expression and terminology consistency.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 84/100."
