  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the podcast dialogue flows naturally. Only a few very long sentences could be split for better pacing, but overall the reader can understand the concepts without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for native speakers. Vocabulary is appropriate and most idiomatic expressions are well chosen. Minor awkwardness appears in places such as “el modelo mismo no aprende” (a more natural phrasing would be “el propio modelo”) and the use of “Ustedes” may feel slightly formal for a podcast, but these do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, anclaje, etc. The terms are consistently used and the occasional English acronym is retained with its Spanish explanation, which matches the expectations of a technically‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational style of the podcast. Cultural references are minimal, and the chosen register (slightly formal, using “Ustedes”) fits a general‑audience Spanish podcast. The informal word “chuleta” adds a colloquial touch that aligns with the original’s conversational vibe.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No sentences or ideas were omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The technical explanations remain intact, ensuring full content transfer.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the podcast’s engaging style, and is readable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor stylistic tweaks could raise fluency a point or two, but the work is solid and faithful to the source.\n\n**Overall score:** 18/20 (average of the five criteria)."
