    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the concepts are explained clearly. A few minor issues (e.g., the use of “ACL” instead of the original “ICL”) do not hinder comprehension, but they could cause a brief moment of confusion for readers unfamiliar with the acronym change.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for native Spanish speakers. Vocabulary is appropriate and the tone matches a conversational podcast. Some phrasing (e.g., “ventana contextual” instead of the more common “ventana de contexto”) is slightly odd, but overall the flow is smooth.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally well handled: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”. The translation of “grounding” as “anclaje en el conocimiento” is acceptable. The only notable inconsistency is the change of the acronym ICL to ACL, which could mislead readers about the original term.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and purpose of the original French script are preserved. The translation adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., using “chuletas” for “cheat‑sheet” which fits the informal podcast style). Minor lexical choices could be refined, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original dialogue is retained. No significant content is omitted. The only loss is the accidental renaming of the ICL acronym, which is a small factual inaccuracy rather than an omission of substantive information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content clearly, maintains a natural conversational tone, and preserves the structure of the original podcast script. The main weakness is the inconsistent handling of the ICL acronym, which should be corrected to avoid confusion. Minor lexical tweaks (e.g., ‘ventana de contexto’) would further improve fluency, but they do not detract significantly from the overall readability and completeness.\n\nThe translation would be excellent for a Spanish‑speaking audience familiar with AI concepts and the informal podcast format.\n\nScore out of 20: 17.0 (average of the five criteria)."
