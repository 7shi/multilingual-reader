  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are clear. Minor issues such as the isolated line “El pre‑entrenamiento.” do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most of the script. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic, and the dialogue flows like a podcast. A few expressions are slightly stiff (e.g., “Envíamos una IA… a la escuela”) and the use of hyphenated forms like “pre‑entrenamiento” could be smoother, but overall the language is fluent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje (grounding). The choice of “anclaje” is acceptable, though “anclaje” is less common than “grounding”. No major mistranslations were found.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts well to a Spanish‑speaking audience. The podcast name is localized to “Tech Relámpago”, and cultural references are neutral. The tone matches the informal, conversational style of the original.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is retained. No sentences or ideas are omitted, and the added clarifications (e.g., “en segundo plano”) help the reader without altering meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, reads smoothly, and respects the original tone. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but the work is essentially excellent for a podcast script aimed at a Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\nOverall Score (out of 100): 91"
