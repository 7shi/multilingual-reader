  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version uses clear, straightforward sentences that preserve the original logical flow. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑specialist can follow. A few long sentences could be split for easier scanning, but overall comprehension is excellent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. Minor awkwardness appears in a couple of constructions (e.g., “una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado” feels a bit heavy, and the capitalization of “Memoria” is inconsistent). Nevertheless, the text flows smoothly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (In‑Context Learning)”, “grounding” → “anclaje”. Where the original kept English terms (fine‑tuning, grounding) the Spanish translation adds the accepted Spanish equivalents or keeps the original in parentheses, which aids understanding without breaking terminology consistency.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator successfully adapted cultural references and idioms to Spanish. French‑style expressions (“comme envoyer un brillant physicien”) are rendered with natural Spanish equivalents. The metaphor of a consultant and the bicycle analogy work well for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Small missed opportunities exist, such as adapting “cheat‑sheet” more idiomatically than “hoja de trucos”, but the overall intent is preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present. No sentences or key points were omitted, and the translation does not add extraneous material. The structure mirrors the source, keeping the dialogue and technical explanations intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation from French to Spanish is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains readability, and generally sounds natural. Minor fluency hiccups and a few stylistic refinements could push it to perfection, but the core message and nuance are well preserved.\n\nStrengths: precise terminology, faithful retention of information, clear explanations of complex concepts. Areas for improvement: smoother phrasing in a couple of longer sentences and more idiomatic choices for occasional terms.\n\nOverall, the work demonstrates a strong command of both languages and the subject matter, making it suitable for a podcast audience interested in AI fundamentals.\n\nScore: 88/100 (average of the five criteria)."
