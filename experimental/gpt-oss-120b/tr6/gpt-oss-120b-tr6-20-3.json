  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the explanations of complex AI concepts are clear and easy to follow. Sentence structures are generally simple and the dialogue format is preserved, making it accessible to the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, using appropriate colloquial expressions (e.g., \"chuleta\"). A few sentences feel slightly literal (“Es una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”) and some verb choices could be smoother, but overall it reads smoothly to native speakers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding → anclaje. The terminology is consistent throughout and matches the level expected for a tech‑focused podcast audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references well (e.g., \"una antisèche\" → \"una chuleta\"). Minor literal traces of the French original remain, but they do not hinder comprehension. Overall the intent and tone of the original are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is retained; no significant details are omitted or added. The translation maintains the same length and level of detail, ensuring the listener receives the full content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation from French to Spanish is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, uses appropriate terminology, and remains comprehensible and engaging for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor fluency hiccups and a few slightly literal phrases prevent a perfect score, but they do not detract significantly from the overall effectiveness of the translation.\nOverall rating reflects a strong performance with room for slight stylistic polishing.\nScore: 18/20."
