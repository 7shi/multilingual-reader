  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The output is a disjointed collection of short sentences, many of which are unrelated to the original podcast script (e.g., \"El cielo está azul\", \"Hola, mundo\", \"El perro corre rápido por el parque\"). The reader cannot follow the logical flow of the conversation, and key explanations are missing. Consequently, comprehension is severely impaired.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the isolated Spanish sentences are grammatically correct, the overall text lacks coherence and natural dialogue. The abrupt switches between unrelated phrases make the passage feel artificial and fragmented, which is far from fluent native‑speaker style.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" appear sporadically, but many are omitted or replaced by irrelevant filler. No consistent handling or explanation of these terms is provided, resulting in poor technical adequacy.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to convey the original intent of a podcast discussion about AI training methods. Cultural or contextual adjustments are absent; instead, the output inserts random statements that do not serve the original purpose. The listener would not grasp the intended message.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Virtually all substantive information from the French source is missing. The original dialogue about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and memory features is not transmitted. Only a handful of unrelated Spanish phrases are present.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "overall_comment": "The provided 'translation' is not a translation at all but a collection of unrelated Spanish snippets. It does not preserve the content, structure, or purpose of the original French podcast script. Readability, fluency, terminology handling, contextual fidelity, and information completeness are all extremely low, indicating a failed translation attempt.\n\nA proper translation should render the entire dialogue coherently, retain all technical concepts, and adapt the language naturally for a Spanish‑speaking audience. This output falls far short of those standards.\n\nOverall score (out of 20): 3"
