    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the ideas of the original French script clearly. Most sentences are easy to follow and the technical concepts are explained in a comprehensible way. Minor issues such as the duplicated \"Camille:\" label at the start and the awkward \"bienvenida/o\" affect smooth reading but do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly natural, but there are several spots that feel forced or unnatural for native speakers: the duplicated speaker tag, the mixed‑gender form \"bienvenida/o\", the switch between \"especialización\" and \"afinamiento\" for the same concept, and the retention of French word \"bachoter\". The presence of markdown markers (** ) also breaks the flow. These quirks lower the fluency slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely correct (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, etc.). However, the translation introduces inconsistent terms for \"affinage\" (\"especialización\" vs \"afinamiento\") and chooses \"referenciación\" for the French \"ancrage (grounding)\", which is not the usual Spanish term (\"anclaje\" or \"grounding\"). The French slang \"bachoter\" is left unchanged instead of a Spanish equivalent. These inconsistencies affect the precision of terminology.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator keeps the original podcast tone and adapts most cultural references appropriately. The explanation of concepts is suitable for a general audience. The only drawback is the occasional retention of French words that may confuse Spanish‑speaking listeners (e.g., \"bachoter\"). Overall, the intent and purpose are well conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information present in the French script is retained in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the examples remain intact. The only superfluous elements are the markdown asterisks, which do not affect the informational content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does an excellent job of preserving the structure and educational value of the original podcast script. It is mostly clear, accurate, and faithful to the source. The main weaknesses are minor stylistic and lexical choices that make the text feel slightly less natural for Spanish speakers, such as inconsistent terminology, the odd \"bienvenida/o\" construction, and the occasional carry‑over of French words. Addressing these points would raise the fluency and terminology scores. Overall, the translation is solid and highly usable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20"
