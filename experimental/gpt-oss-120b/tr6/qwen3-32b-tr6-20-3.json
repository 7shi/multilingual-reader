  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured, the flow of the dialogue mirrors the original, and complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) are explained clearly. Minor punctuation quirks do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic, and the use of inverted question marks and proper Spanish punctuation makes it read smoothly. The only noticeable slip is the retention of the French word *antisèche* instead of a Spanish equivalent like *chuleta*, which feels slightly out of place.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)*, and *anclaje* are all correctly rendered. Consistency is maintained throughout. The occasional use of English abbreviation (ICL) is acceptable given the context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural references are neutral, and the explanations are adapted to a Spanish‑speaking audience without loss of meaning. The only cultural mismatch is the untranslated *antisèche*.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No content is omitted, and no unnecessary repetitions are introduced. The translation faithfully conveys the full dialogue and examples.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, accurately conveying the technical content and the conversational style of the original podcast script. Minor lexical choices—most notably the use of the French term *antisèche*—prevent it from being completely natural, but they do not affect the overall clarity. The translation succeeds in delivering the intended message to a Spanish‑speaking audience with excellent readability, appropriate terminology, and full information retention.\n\nOverall score: 91/100."
