    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the dialogue structure mirrors the original. However, a few sentences are awkward (e.g., “le damos las informaciones de las que necesita…”, the repetition of “en lugar de reentrenar la IA…” and the stray French word *requête*). These minor hiccups slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural but mixes registers (informal *podés* with otherwise formal language) and contains some clunky phrasing (“en el prompt”, “en la consulta”). Overall a native speaker would understand it, but the flow is not as smooth as a native‑written script.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is handled well: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *transfer learning*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto* (ICL) are all correctly rendered. The occasional retention of English terms (prompt) is acceptable in this domain. The only lapse is the untranslated French word *requête*.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, adapting analogies (consultor brillante, aprender a montar en bicicleta) appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor register inconsistencies and the stray French word reduce the cultural polish slightly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are present; no substantive information is lost. The only minor defect is the leftover French term, which does not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version conveys the original podcast’s concepts accurately and retains most of the conversational tone. It is largely readable and technically sound, but occasional awkward phrasing, mixed registers, and a few untranslated fragments prevent it from reaching a fully native‑level quality. Minor editing would bring it to a higher standard.\nOverall score (out of 100): 85/100."
