  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow; sentences are logical and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor issues such as the mixed gender form \"bienvenido/a\" do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are a few awkward expressions (e.g., \"en las entrañas\" for \"en coulisses\", \"el afinamiento\" instead of a more common \"fine‑tuning\" or \"ajuste fino\"). These hiccups prevent a fully native‑like flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved and correctly rendered (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding). The choice of \"afinamiento\" is consistent, though less usual than \"ajuste fino\".",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the original intent and tone, adapting the introductory greeting and examples appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are handled well.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present; no significant content is omitted or added unnecessarily. The meaning of each segment is retained.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. Minor phrasing oddities and a slightly uncommon term for fine‑tuning keep it from being perfect, but readability and completeness are excellent. With a few stylistic tweaks it would read as fully native."
