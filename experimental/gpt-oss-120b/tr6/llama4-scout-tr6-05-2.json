  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clearly expressed. Sentence structures are mostly logical, and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto) are understandable. Minor issues such as inconsistent use of quotation marks, occasional missing accents, and a few redundant English terms slightly affect smooth reading, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are occasional awkward phrasings (e.g., “El IA no es constantemente afinada…”, mixed use of English abbreviations, and informal slang like “chuleta”). Some sentences retain a literal feel from the French source, and the mix of formal and informal registers is a bit uneven. Overall, a native speaker would understand it, but the flow is not completely fluid.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto” and “memoria a corto plazo” are correctly rendered and used consistently. The choice of “anclaje” for “grounding” is appropriate, and the occasional English acronym (ICL) is retained with its English expansion, which is acceptable in a tech podcast context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style of the podcast. Cultural adaptation is modest but adequate (e.g., using “Imaginad” which fits a European Spanish audience). The informal term “chuleta” adds a colloquial flavor that matches the conversational style, though it may be too slangy for some listeners. Overall, the adaptation conveys the original message effectively.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as in the source. Minor nuances such as the adjective “incroyablement” are paraphrased (“ineficaz”), which does not change the meaning. Redundancy is minimal, and the content stays concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content and the lively podcast atmosphere. It is readable and mostly natural, with strong handling of terminology and complete coverage of the original material. Minor fluency hiccups and occasional informal word choices prevent it from being perfect, but the overall quality is high and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
