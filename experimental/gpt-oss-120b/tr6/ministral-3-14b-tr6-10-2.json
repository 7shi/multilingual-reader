  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Sentences are generally short and clear, making the technical discussion accessible. A few minor punctuation quirks (e.g., missing question marks) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and the conversational tone is preserved. Small inconsistencies (e.g., “el afinado” vs. “ajuste fino”) and occasional awkward phrasing slightly reduce the fluidity.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: “entrenamiento previo”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “ventana de contexto”, “anclaje”. The only minor flaw is the inconsistent use of “el afinado” instead of the previously introduced “ajuste fino”. Overall, terminology handling is solid.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French podcast style to Spanish without losing the informal, explanatory tone. Cultural references are neutral, and idiomatic expressions (e.g., “cajas negras”, “como contratar a un experto”) fit Spanish-speaking audiences. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve impact, but the intent is fully conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original script is retained. No major ideas or examples are omitted, and the flow of the dialogue remains intact. Minor omissions such as the “¡Analogía perfecta!” exclamation are negligible for understanding.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It faithfully conveys the technical content and the conversational spirit of the podcast. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency and contextual adaptation are very good with only small inconsistencies. The translation could be polished further by standardising terminology (always using “ajuste fino”) and smoothing a few awkward phrases, but it serves its purpose excellently for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\nOverall Score (average of criteria): 17.6/20 ≈ 18/20."
