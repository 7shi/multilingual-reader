  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are clear and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. Minor issues such as occasional leftover speaker tags (e.g., \"**Luc:**\") and the formal \"Usted\" that feels a bit stiff in a podcast setting do not significantly impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few literal renderings and awkward phrases (e.g., \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\", \"prompt\" left in English, inconsistent use of formal pronouns). The presence of formatting artifacts also disrupts the smoothness. Overall, a native speaker would understand it, but it could be polished.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly translated and consistently used: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, anclaje (grounding). The only slight lapse is keeping the English word \"prompt\", which is acceptable in many technical contexts but could have been adapted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original podcast are retained. The translation respects the Spanish‑speaking audience, though the use of the formal \"Usted\" feels out of place for a casual podcast dialogue that originally used the neutral French \"on\". Minor cultural adjustments could improve engagement.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No substantive ideas or examples are omitted, and the technical explanations remain intact. The only loss is the occasional markup residue, which does not affect content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the technical content well. It is readable and largely natural, but it suffers from a few formatting leftovers, inconsistent formality, and occasional literal phrasing that slightly reduces fluency. With a final proofreading pass to clean up tags and adjust the register, it would be a high‑quality Spanish adaptation of the podcast script.\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 82/100."
