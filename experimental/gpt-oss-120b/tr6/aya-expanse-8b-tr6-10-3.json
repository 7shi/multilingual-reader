    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the flow of the original dialogue. However, there are several awkward phrasings, unnecessary quotation marks, and occasional repetition (e.g., \"¿Por qué ya entiende Camille los conceptos…\"). Some sentences feel overly literal or stilted, which can make the reading experience a bit choppy for a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many non‑native constructions: mixed use of formal \"Usted\" and informal \"tú\", misplaced colons (\"Luc afirma:\" inside the spoken line), and inconsistent punctuation. Some terms are left in English or French, and the final episode name is changed to \"Tech Rápido\" instead of preserving the original brand. These issues lower the naturalness of the text.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly conveyed correctly (pre‑entrenamiento, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL). The translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"especialización\" is not the standard term in Spanish (\"ajuste fino\" or \"afinamiento\" would be expected) and the term is used inconsistently. Other terms such as \"grounding\" are rendered as \"anclaje\", which is acceptable. Overall, the terminology is understandable but not fully consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original intent and educational tone. Cultural adaptation is minimal but adequate; the only noticeable deviation is the change of the podcast name at the end. The mix of formal and informal registers and the occasional literal translation of idioms (e.g., \"hacer trampa\" for \"bachotage\") slightly affect the natural fit for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the explanation of memory‑like features. No major ideas are omitted, and the dialogue structure is kept. Minor changes (the final podcast name) do not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in conveying the technical content and the conversational structure of the original podcast. Nonetheless, it suffers from several fluency and stylistic issues that make it feel less natural to native Spanish speakers. Terminology is mostly correct but could be more consistent, especially for \"fine‑tuning\". With a bit of editing to smooth out the phrasing, unify the register, and standardize technical terms, the translation would be of high quality."
