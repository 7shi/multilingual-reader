  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and the dialogue flow is easy to follow. Most sentences convey the original ideas, and complex concepts are explained in plain language. Minor issues such as occasional French fragments (e.g., “C’est donc”) slightly interrupt comprehension, but they do not prevent understanding.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several unnatural expressions and language mixing that break the natural flow for a native Spanish speaker: \"C’est donc una memoria\", \"Merci por escucharnos\", inconsistent use of \"abres\" vs \"abre\", and occasional literal translations that sound awkward. The majority of the text is fluent, but these errors lower the overall naturalness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are correctly rendered and consistently used. Some English terms like \"prompt\" are left untranslated, which is acceptable for the target audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally preserves the original intent and tone, but the presence of French fragments and the unchanged podcast title \"Tech Éclair\" reduce cultural adaptation for Spanish‑speaking listeners. A few expressions could have been localized more naturally.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All substantive information from the French source is retained. No major ideas are omitted, and the structure of the dialogue remains intact. Minor stylistic redundancies from the original are kept, but they do not affect completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core content accurately and maintains most of the technical explanations, but it suffers from occasional language mixing and slightly awkward phrasing that affect fluency and cultural adaptation. With a few edits to eliminate French leftovers and smooth out idiomatic Spanish, the text would reach a higher quality level.\nOverall rating: 16/20 (average of the five criteria)."
