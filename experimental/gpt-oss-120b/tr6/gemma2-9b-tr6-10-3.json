    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas and the flow of the podcast dialogue is preserved. A few sentences are long and could be split for better clarity, and a couple of minor awkward phrasings (e.g., \"para darle un conocimiento básico\") slightly hinder smooth reading, but overall a native‑Spanish reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several instances of non‑native constructions: the subjunctive error in \"antes de que él no se ocupara\", the unusual term \"afianzamiento\" for fine‑tuning, and occasional literal translations such as \"enraizado\" instead of the more common \"anclaje\" or \"fundamentación\". Vocabulary is mostly appropriate, but the unnatural bits break the natural rhythm, lowering the fluency rating.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely correct: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are well rendered. However, inconsistency appears with \"afinamiento\" versus \"afianzamiento\" for fine‑tuning, and the choice of \"afianzamiento\" is atypical. Overall the terms are understandable, but the inconsistency costs points.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are neutral and the analogies (consultant, exam cramming) work in Spanish. Minor issues (the literal “consultor temporal” phrase is acceptable, but some phrasing could be smoother) do not affect the overall conveyance of purpose.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the dialogue structure is maintained. The translation does not add irrelevant material, and the content remains concise yet complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the educational spirit of the podcast and conveys the technical concepts accurately. Readability and completeness are strong points. Fluency and terminology suffer from occasional literalism and inconsistent handling of fine‑tuning terminology, which make the text feel slightly less natural to native speakers. With minor edits—correcting the subjunctive mistake, using a consistent term such as \"ajuste fino\" for fine‑tuning, and smoothing a few awkward phrases—the translation would reach a higher quality level."
