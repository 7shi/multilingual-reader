    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the flow of ideas mirrors the original French script. Minor issues such as a missing question mark after “¿es decir” and occasional overly long sentences slightly hinder smooth reading, but overall a Spanish‑speaking audience can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are a few awkward phrasings (e.g., “aunque su aprendizaje sea un proceso muy real”, “es una forma astuta de aprendizaje contextual automatizado”). Some punctuation errors (double «Luc:» line) and inconsistent capitalization of technical terms also break the flow. Nonetheless, the language is fluent enough for native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)*, *anclaje*, etc. The terms are consistently used and, where needed, clarified (e.g., ICL). The only slight inconsistency is the retention of the original podcast name “Tech Éclair” at the end, but this does not affect technical understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the tone and style to a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience, using appropriate punctuation (¡ ? ¡) and familiar analogies. Cultural references remain neutral, preserving the original intent. Minor inconsistencies (different naming of the podcast at the start vs. the end) are present but do not distort meaning.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key concepts from the French original are retained: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No substantive information is lost; only small typographical redundancies appear (the duplicated \"Luc:\" label).",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. Strengths lie in accurate terminology and faithful transmission of the original ideas. Weaknesses are limited to occasional unnatural phrasing, minor punctuation slips, and a few consistency issues with naming. With a small editorial pass, the text would read as a polished Spanish podcast script.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20.\n\n**Overall Score**: 17"
