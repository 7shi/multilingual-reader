    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the structure of the original dialogue. Most sentences convey the intended meaning, and the technical concepts are explained clearly. However, there are several grammatical slips (e.g., «¡Hola y bienvenido en…», «las conocencias», the French word «incroyablement» left untranslated) that slightly hinder smooth comprehension for a native reader.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains a number of unnatural expressions and awkward phrasing: «¡Hola y bienvenido en», «Mira bien», «copiar» for «bachoter», and the French interjection «incroyablement». These choices break the flow and make the text sound like a literal, machine‑generated rendering rather than a natural Spanish podcast script. Despite these issues, the overall narrative is still intelligible.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well overall. Key terms such as «preentrenamiento», «afinamiento», «aprendizaje por transferencia», «ventana de contexto», «aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)», and the parenthetical clarification of «anclaje (grounding)» are correctly translated and consistently used. Minor typographical errors (e.g., «conocencias») do not affect the technical meaning.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience, keeping the informal podcast tone. Nevertheless, some phrasing feels literal and does not fully capture the natural conversational style expected in Spanish media. The presence of a French word and occasional literal translations reduce the cultural fit.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present. No major ideas are omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is preserved. The only drawbacks are minor typographical and lexical errors that do not cause loss of meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full content and maintains the technical accuracy required for a podcast about AI. It succeeds in delivering the concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning. However, several grammatical and stylistic issues—such as misplaced prepositions, a few incorrect word choices, and an untranslated French adverb—prevent it from sounding fully natural to native Spanish listeners. A revision focusing on fluency and idiomatic expressions would raise the overall quality considerably.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15 out of 20.\n\n**Suggested improvements**:\n1. Correct grammatical slips (e.g., «¡Hola y bienvenido a», «las conocimientos», remove French word). \n2. Replace literal phrases like «Mira bien» with more natural alternatives (e.g., «Fíjate bien»). \n3. Adjust the tone to match typical Spanish podcast speech, ensuring smoother transitions and consistent use of gender/number agreements.\n\nThese changes would bring the translation much closer to native‑speaker quality while preserving the technical fidelity of the original content.\n\n**Final overall score**: 15/20"
