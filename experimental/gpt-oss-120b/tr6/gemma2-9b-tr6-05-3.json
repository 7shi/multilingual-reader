    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and conveys the original ideas. The dialogue flow is preserved and the concepts are explained in clear language. Minor hiccups such as the plural “informaciones” instead of the more natural singular “información”, and occasional mixed‑language fragments, slightly disrupt the smoothness but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several moments where the wording feels unnatural for a native speaker: “en trasladando los conceptos”, the abrupt insertion of French “C'est donc”, the switch between “Tech Rayo” and later back to “Tech Éclair”, and the use of “se acuerda” instead of the more idiomatic “recuerda”. These issues make the text feel a bit forced, though the majority of sentences read fluently.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje/grounding, etc. The translation keeps the jargon consistent, which is appropriate for the target audience. The only slight deviation is the choice of “afinamiento” rather than the more common “ajuste fino”, but it is still understandable.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the informal podcast tone and adapts the examples well for a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, the inconsistent handling of the podcast title (Tech Rayo vs. Tech Éclair) and the occasional French fragments reduce cultural coherence. Overall, the intent is preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present. No substantive information is omitted, and the explanations remain intact. Minor stylistic repetitions and the mixed‑language insertions are the only issues, but they do not affect the factual content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the original discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning. It is largely accurate and comprehensive, but suffers from occasional non‑native phrasing, mixed language fragments, and inconsistent naming of the podcast. Cleaning up those spots would raise the fluency and readability scores significantly, bringing the overall quality to a high‑intermediate level suitable for a technically‑savvy Spanish audience."
