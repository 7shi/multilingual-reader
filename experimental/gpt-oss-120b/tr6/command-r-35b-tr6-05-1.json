  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the logical flow of the dialogue is preserved. However, there are several punctuation problems (misplaced or missing quotation marks), redundant speaker tags inside the speech, and occasional awkward phrasing that can momentarily disrupt comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many natural‑sounding sentences, but several expressions sound odd to a native speaker (e.g., “enviamos a la última inteligencia artificial al colegio”, “el afinado”, “fijación” for grounding). Inconsistencies in terminology and occasional missing accents also affect smoothness.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, transferencia de aprendizaje, ventana de contexto and aprendizaje en contexto are correctly rendered. Nevertheless, the term “grounding” is translated as “fijación” (the original used “anclaje”), and both “ajuste fino” and “afinado” are used interchangeably, which reduces consistency.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content to Spanish‑speaking listeners, but it changes the podcast name from « Tech Éclair » to “Tech Express” and later reverts to the original, creating inconsistency. Some cultural references are kept, but the mixed naming may confuse the audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the original script are present, and no essential segment is omitted. Minor deviations (the name change, occasional missing quotation marks) do not affect the factual content, so the information is largely complete.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation conveys the technical discussion accurately and is fairly readable, but it suffers from punctuation errors, inconsistent terminology, and a few unnatural expressions. The occasional change of the podcast title and the inconsistent handling of the term “grounding” detract from professionalism. With a careful proofread and tighter terminology consistency, the translation would reach a higher quality level."
