    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The prompt does not contain the French source text nor the Spanish translation to be evaluated. Without the actual texts, it is impossible to judge whether the target‑language readers can easily understand the content, whether complex concepts are explained clearly, or whether the sentence structure is logical.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Because no translated Spanish passage is provided, I cannot assess the naturalness, smoothness, or appropriateness of vocabulary in the target language.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Without seeing the technical terms used in the source and how they were rendered in Spanish, I cannot evaluate the handling of terminology, consistency, or need for explanations.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The lack of source and target texts prevents any judgment about how well the translation conveys the original intent, adapts culturally, or optimizes expressions for the Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "I cannot verify whether any information was omitted, supplemented, or redundantly repeated because the relevant content is missing.",

    },
    "overall_comment": "To provide a meaningful evaluation, please supply both the original French passage and its Spanish translation. With those texts available, I can assess readability, fluency, terminology, contextual adaptation, and information completeness according to the criteria outlined, and assign appropriate scores out of 20 for each category."
