    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences flow logically and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are well rendered. A few minor hiccups—such as the phrase “el aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotage” and the retention of French quotation marks—slightly disrupt smooth reading, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural in most places and uses appropriate colloquial Spanish (¡Una analogía perfecta!, ¡Exacto!). However, occasional borrowings that feel out of place in Spanish (“bachotage”, French guillemets « » around palabras) and a couple of slightly stiff constructions lower the overall naturalness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, etc. Consistency is maintained throughout. The word “prompt” is left in English, which is acceptable in a tech‑savvy context, and no essential term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts the content for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are appropriate, and the tone of a podcast dialogue is preserved. The only drawback is the use of the French loanword “bachotage” instead of a Spanish equivalent such as “memorización” or “estudio intensivo,” which slightly reduces cultural adaptation.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant details are omitted, and the logical progression of ideas is intact. Redundancies are minimal, and the translation remains concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and maintains the conversational style of the podcast. Minor issues—chiefly the lingering French terms and punctuation—prevent it from being perfectly fluent, but they do not affect the transmission of meaning. With a few adjustments (replace \"bachotage\" with a Spanish term, use Spanish quotation marks), the translation would be exemplary.\n"
