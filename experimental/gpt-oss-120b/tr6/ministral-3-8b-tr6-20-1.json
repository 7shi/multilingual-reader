  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured, and complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in plain language. Only a tiny hiccup is the occasional slightly formal tone, but overall comprehension is very high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker. Most expressions are idiomatic, but there are a few minor slips (e.g., \"Lo han entendido todo\" and the grammatical error \"Las conocimientos\" instead of \"Los conocimientos\"). These do not impede understanding but slightly reduce the natural flow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently and correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje (grounding). The translator also kept the English acronym ICL and the French‑origin term « Mémoire » explained in Spanish, which shows good handling of terminology.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the target audience’s cultural context and preserves the original intent. Metaphors (consultant vs. cyclist) are kept, and the explanation of the new \"Memoria\" feature is adapted smoothly for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present. No significant information is omitted, and the logical sequence of the conversation is intact. The only minor issue is the small grammatical mistake, which does not affect content completeness.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains engaging, and is largely fluent. The few minor grammatical and stylistic glitches prevent a perfect score but are easily correctable. The translator shows solid grasp of both languages and the subject matter.\n\nStrengths: accurate terminology, clear explanations, good cultural adaptation.\nWeaknesses: occasional awkward phrasing and a small gender‑agreement error.\n\nThe text would be ready for publication after a quick proofread to fix the minor errors.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18.6 → 19/20."
