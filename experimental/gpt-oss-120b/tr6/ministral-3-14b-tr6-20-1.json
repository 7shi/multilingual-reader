    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas without confusing constructions, and the technical concepts are explained in a way a non‑specialist can understand.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly naturally, but there are several awkward spots: \"el afinamiento\" (less common than \"ajuste fino\"), \"aprendizaje en contexto activo\" (odd phrasing), the French word \"extraits\" left untranslated, and occasional over‑use of asterisks for emphasis. These hiccups lower the overall smoothness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding → anclaje, etc. Consistency is good, though a few terms could be more idiomatic (e.g., \"extraits\" → \"extractos\").",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. It adapts some expressions to Spanish culture (e.g., \"chuleta\" for cheat‑sheet) and keeps the podcast‑like dialogue intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No relevant information from the French source is omitted. All explanations, analogies, and examples are present, and the structure mirrors the original script.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is accurate and faithful to the source, with excellent completeness and clear explanations. Fluency is the main area for improvement, especially removing residual French terms and smoothing some literal renderings. Terminology is solid, and the text is readable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nThe translation would benefit from a final proofread by a native speaker to fix the few awkward phrases and ensure all foreign words are fully localized.\n\nFinal averaged score (out of 20): 18.0.\n\n---\n**Scoring breakdown**\n- Readability: 18/20\n- Fluency: 15/20\n- Terminology: 17/20\n- Contextual Adaptation: 18/20\n- Information Completeness: 20/20\n- **Overall Score:** 18/20"
