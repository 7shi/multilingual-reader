  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are retained. Minor punctuation quirks do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. A few constructions feel slightly forced (e.g., \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\"), but overall the flow is smooth and conversational.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje\". The English acronyms are kept, which matches common practice in Spanish technical discourse. No important term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish‑speaking listeners, using suitable equivalents like \"Tech Relámpago\" and appropriate interjections (\"¡Hasta pronto!\"). Cultural references are neutral, and the dialogue feels natural for a Spanish audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and analogies from the original French are present. No information is omitted or distorted, and the logical progression of the discussion is maintained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It preserves the instructional content and the lively podcast style while using correct technical vocabulary. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but the text is readily understandable and faithful to the source.\n\nStrengths: accurate terminology, complete conveyance of information, good adaptation to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Areas for improvement: smooth out a few slightly clunky phrases for a more natural spoken feel.\n\nThe translation earns a strong overall rating, reflecting its effectiveness for the target audience.\n\nOverall score (sum of the five criteria): 92/100."
