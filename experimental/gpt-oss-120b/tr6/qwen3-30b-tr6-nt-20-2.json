    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "I cannot assess readability because the French source text and the Spanish translation are missing. To evaluate whether Spanish readers can easily understand the content, I need to see the actual translation.",

    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Fluency and naturalness can only be judged after reviewing the Spanish version. Without the text, I cannot detect awkward phrasing or unnatural grammar.",

    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology evaluation requires the specific terms used in both the source and target texts. Since they are not provided, I cannot determine if terminology is appropriate or consistent.",

    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Assessing contextual adaptation depends on how well the translation conveys the original intent and cultural nuances. The necessary material is absent, so I cannot give a meaningful score.",

      "reasoning": "To verify that all information from the French source is retained, I need both the source and the translated text. Without them, completeness cannot be measured.",

    },
    "overall_comment": "The evaluation cannot be performed because the French source text and its Spanish translation were not included in the request. Please provide the original French passage and the corresponding Spanish translation so I can conduct a thorough assessment according to the specified criteria."
