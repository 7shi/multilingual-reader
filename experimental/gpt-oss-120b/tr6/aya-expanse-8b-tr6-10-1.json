  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the dialogue format is preserved. Most sentences are clear, and the technical ideas are explained in plain language. A few awkward phrasings (e.g., duplication of the name “Camille” inside a question, inconsistent use of quotation marks) slightly disrupt flow, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several spots that feel stilted or overly literal: \"El pre‑entrenamiento\" is fine, but \"especialización\" for fine‑tuning is less common than “ajuste fino”. The insertion of speaker tags like “Luc afirma:” inside the spoken lines is redundant and unusual in spoken Spanish. Some punctuation (quotes around whole sentences) is non‑idiomatic.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely correctly rendered: pre‑training → pre‑entrenamiento, in‑context learning → aprendizaje en contexto, grounding → anclaje. However, fine‑tuning is translated as “especialización”, which is understandable but not the standard term in the field (“ajuste fino”). Transfer learning is rendered as “aprendizaje transferido”, which is acceptable but could be “aprendizaje por transferencia”. Consistency could be improved.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural adaptation is adequate; the podcast name is rendered as “Tech Rápido”, which conveys the same idea. Minor issues remain (e.g., retaining some French‑style quotation marks) but they do not affect the overall message.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key points from the original dialogue are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No substantive information is lost, though there is some redundancy due to extra speaker‑tag phrases.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Readability and completeness are strong, but fluency and terminology could be refined – especially by using more standard AI jargon (e.g., “ajuste fino”) and smoothing out redundant speaker tags and punctuation. With these tweaks the text would feel fully native and polished.\n\nFinal score (sum of the five criteria): 76 / 100."
