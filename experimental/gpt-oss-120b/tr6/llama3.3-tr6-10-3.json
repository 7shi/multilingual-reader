    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor hiccups (e.g., “una IA completamente nueva a la escuela”) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and the flow is smooth, though a few literal renderings such as “una función de memorización” or “enraizamiento” feel slightly forced.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL). The choice of “enraizamiento” for “grounding” is uncommon; “anclaje” would be more idiomatic, but the meaning is still clear.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts the discourse to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the conversational tone is maintained. A few phrasing choices remain too literal, but they do not affect the overall message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is retained. No significant omissions or additions are observed, and the logical progression of ideas is preserved.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical discussion clearly and keeps the podcast’s informal, explanatory style. Minor lexical choices (e.g., “enraizamiento”) and a few slightly literal constructions prevent a perfect score, but the text is fully understandable and faithful to the source.\n\nStrengths: clear explanations, consistent terminology, complete transfer of content.\nWeaknesses: occasional unnatural phrasing and a non‑standard translation of “grounding”.\n\nThe translation would be readily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners interested in AI concepts, with only minimal polishing needed for maximum naturalness.\n\nScore out of 20: 17"
