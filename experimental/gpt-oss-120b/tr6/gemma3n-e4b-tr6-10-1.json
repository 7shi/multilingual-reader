  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the technical concepts are explained clearly. A few typographical errors (e.g., “Transformeers”, “rfine”, “recodar”) and occasional mismatches in pronoun form (mix of ‘tú’ and ‘usted’) slightly interrupt the flow, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several awkward constructions and typos reduce its smoothness: “se rfine”, “da la impresión de que realmente empiezan a recodar”, and the inconsistent use of formal vs. informal pronouns. These issues make the text feel less polished for a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “fine‑tuning”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto” and “anclaje” are correctly rendered and used consistently throughout. The occasional English term left in parentheses (e.g., “fine‑tuning”) is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of the podcast script. Cultural references are minimal and thus correctly kept. Minor issues arise from the mixed register (formal ‘usted’ vs. informal ‘tú’) and the typo “Transformeers”, which slightly affect the adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French source is present. No major ideas are omitted, and the explanations remain faithful. The only drawbacks are typographical errors (e.g., “rfine”, “recodar”) that could cause momentary confusion, but they do not lead to loss of meaning.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the technical content accurately and is largely understandable. It succeeds in preserving the educational tone of the podcast. However, typographical mistakes, occasional unnatural phrasing, and inconsistent pronoun usage prevent it from reaching a higher level of polish. A light proofread and a more consistent register would bring the fluency and readability up to a native‑speaker standard.\n\nScore out of 20: 16"
