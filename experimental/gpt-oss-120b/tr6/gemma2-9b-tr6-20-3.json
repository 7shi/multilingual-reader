  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and follows the logical flow of the original dialogue. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in understandable terms. A few sentences are a bit verbose or use uncommon phrasing (e.g., “El afianzamiento…”) which can momentarily hinder smooth comprehension, but overall the reader can follow the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally, but there are several awkward constructions that a native speaker would likely rephrase (e.g., “¿Qué me dices si… no enseñarías…”, “El entrenamiento previo.” as a standalone line, and the use of “afianzamiento” for fine‑tuning). The occasional literal retention of English terms like “prompt” also feels out of place. These issues lower the overall fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly well‑handled: “preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “ventana de contexto”, “memoria a corto plazo”, and “grounding” rendered as “anclaje”. The choice of “puesta a punto” for fine‑tuning is appropriate, though “afianzamiento” is less common. Overall, the terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal podcast tone and the original intent. Cultural references are neutral, and the title “Tech Éclair” is kept, which is acceptable. Minor stylistic tweaks could make the dialogue feel more natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but the essential message and style are retained.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French source is present. No sentences or ideas are omitted, and the logical sequence is maintained. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and maintains the educational, conversational tone of the podcast. While the terminology and completeness are strong, the fluency suffers from a few literal translations and uncommon word choices that make parts sound stilted. Improving those phrasing issues would bring the translation closer to native‑speaker quality.\nOverall score: 87/100."
