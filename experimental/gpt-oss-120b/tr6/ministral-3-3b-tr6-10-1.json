  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version flows logically and the concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can follow. Sentences are generally short and clear, and the dialogue format is preserved. Some occasional long sentences (e.g., the paragraph starting with \"Es increíblemente flexible…\") could be split for easier comprehension, but overall the text is highly readable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most of the script. Word choices such as \"desentrañar\", \"afinamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"consultor brillante\" are idiomatic. Minor issues appear: \"consultor brillante\" is a literal rendering of \"brilliant consultant\" and sounds slightly forced; \"crunch\" is left untranslated and marked as a loanword, which can break fluency for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Overall, fluency is very good.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\" (kept as \"afinamiento\"), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje\" are appropriate. The translator kept the English acronym ICL and added the Spanish translation, which is helpful. The note about \"conocimientos\" shows awareness of nuance. The only questionable term is the retention of \"crunch\" without explanation, which could confuse readers unfamiliar with the English slang.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references well; the podcast tone is maintained, and the analogy of a consultant is preserved. The translator adds a few explanatory brackets (e.g., \"Nota: …\") that help Spanish readers. The use of \"consultor brillante\" instead of a more natural \"consultor experto\" is a slight mismatch, but overall the intent, humor, and educational purpose are fully conveyed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No key ideas are omitted, and the added parenthetical note about \"conocimientos\" clarifies a potential ambiguity. Redundancy is not introduced, and the length remains comparable to the source. The only minor loss is the nuance of \"bachoter\" versus \"estudiar de memoria\" – the translation captures it, but the original colloquial flavor of \"bachoter\" is slightly diluted.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational podcast style, and is largely natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor lexical choices (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", retaining \"crunch\") prevent a perfect score, but they do not hinder understanding. Overall, the work demonstrates solid bilingual proficiency and good handling of specialized terminology.\n\nStrengths: clear structure, appropriate technical terminology, faithful conveyance of original meaning, useful explanatory notes.\nAreas for improvement: polish a few slightly awkward phrasing, replace untranslated slang with Spanish equivalents, and consider smoother synonyms for \"consultor brillante\".\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17.8 → rounded to 18 out of 20."
