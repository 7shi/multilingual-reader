  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely understandable and follows the structure of the original dialogue. Most sentences convey the intended meaning, and complex concepts are explained. However, there are occasional grammatical slips (e.g., \"bienvenido en\" instead of \"bienvenido a\") and minor typographical errors that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text contains several unnatural expressions and inconsistencies in register (mix of \"tú\" and \"Usted\"). Words such as \"bacheo\" and the untranslated French term \"antisèche\" feel out of place. Despite these issues, a native speaker can follow the conversation, but the flow is not completely natural.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved or correctly translated (e.g., \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\"). Some French terms (\"pré‑entraînement\", \"l'affinage\") are left in their original form, which may be acceptable for a technically‑savvy audience but reduces consistency. The term \"conocencias\" is a typo for \"conocimientos\".",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally retains the original intent, but cultural and linguistic adaptation is uneven. French words remain untranslated, and the shift between formal and informal pronouns can confuse readers. The overall purpose of explaining AI learning methods is preserved.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the ideas from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted, and the examples are kept intact. Minor stylistic redundancies are present, but they do not affect the completeness of the content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original material accurately and keeps the technical content intact. Readability is good, but fluency suffers from occasional awkward phrasing and inconsistent register. Terminology is mostly correct, though some French terms could be fully translated for consistency. Cultural adaptation could be improved, especially by standardising pronouns and removing untranslated jargon. Overall, it is a solid translation that would be easily understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience familiar with AI concepts, but it would benefit from a final edit for naturalness and consistency.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20"
