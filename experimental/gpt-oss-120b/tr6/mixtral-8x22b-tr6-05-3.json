  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clearly conveyed. Sentence structures are mostly logical, but a few long sentences and occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., “La integridad del historial de su discusión”) slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several non‑native constructions: “Ustedes han comprendido todo”, missing accent in “¿Porque…?” (should be “¿Por qué?”), and the use of “ancoraje” instead of the more common “anclaje”. These errors make the translation feel a bit stilted, though overall it remains understandable.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled well: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, etc., are correctly rendered. The only notable slip is the inconsistent translation of “grounding” as “ancoraje”. Otherwise terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast’s style to a Spanish‑speaking audience (e.g., “Tecno Destello”). Cultural references are preserved and the tone stays informal yet informative. Minor literal translations (e.g., “Ustedes”) keep it slightly formal, but the overall intent is maintained.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the original content is present; no ideas or examples are omitted. The only small deviation is the retention of the original French podcast name at the very end, which does not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the original French dialogue, especially regarding technical content. Readability and completeness are strong, but fluency suffers from a handful of grammatical slips and unnatural phrasing. Terminology is mostly spot‑on, with a minor inconsistency. Overall, it is a good translation that would be easily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners, though it could benefit from a native‑speaker polish to improve naturalness.\n\n**Total score (out of 100): 82**\n\n**Breakdown:** Readability 16/20, Fluency 14/20, Terminology 17/20, Contextual Adaptation 16/20, Information Completeness 19/20."
