    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall easy to follow. Sentences are mostly clear and the logical flow mirrors the original. Minor issues such as occasional overly long sentences and a few punctuation quirks do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several small awkward constructions (e.g., \"¡Exactamente !\", \"informaciónes\", \"Se tiene la impresión\"). These affect the smoothness expected from a native‑speaker text.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\" and \"grounding\" are correctly rendered or left in the accepted English form. Consistency is good throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone. Cultural references are neutral, and the explanatory style is kept. Minor typographic errors (extra spaces before exclamation marks) are present but do not change meaning.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the ideas, examples, and nuances of the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted; only a small typo \"informaciónes\" appears.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency suffers from a handful of awkward phrasing and typographical slips. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation that would be easily understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts, but a final proof‑read could raise the naturalness to a near‑native level.\nScore breakdown: 16 / 20 (readability) + 15 / 20 (fluency) + 18 / 20 (terminology) + 17 / 20 (contextual adaptation) + 19 / 20 (information completeness) = **85 / 100** overall."
