  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the podcast‑style explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are understandable for a non‑expert audience. Minor issues such as the use of the English word *prompt* and occasional long sentences do not significantly hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most of the script, but there are a few awkward constructions and grammatical slips (e.g., “las conocimientos”, spacing before punctuation, overly formal “Ustedes pueden…”, and the untranslated *prompt*). These flaws make the flow feel slightly stilted in places.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is well handled: *preentrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning* → *afinamiento*, *transfer learning* → *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *grounding*, etc. Consistency is maintained throughout. Only the word *prompt* could have been explained or localized, but it does not impair understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast tone, uses appropriate Spanish punctuation and expressions, and adapts cultural references (e.g., maintaining the show title, using Spanish‑style exclamations). Small stylistic tweaks could improve engagement, but overall the intent and register are faithfully reproduced.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines and explanatory content from the French original are present. No substantive information is omitted or altered; the only changes are minor punctuation or wording adjustments that do not affect meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. It succeeds in making complex AI concepts accessible to a Spanish‑speaking audience while keeping the conversational style of the podcast. The main areas for improvement are minor grammatical slips and a few unnatural phrasing choices that slightly affect fluency.\n\nStrengths: accurate terminology, complete transfer of information, good readability. Weaknesses: occasional gender agreement errors, inconsistent handling of English loanwords, and some stiff sentences.\n\nThe translation would be well‑understood by listeners, though a light edit for fluency would raise it to a near‑perfect level.\n\nScore (out of 100): 87"
