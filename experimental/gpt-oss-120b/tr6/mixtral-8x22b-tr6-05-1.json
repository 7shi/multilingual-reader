  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas without confusing constructions. Minor issues such as the mixed use of the original French podcast name at the end do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are a few awkward phrases (e.g., “Ustedes han comprendido todo”, “ancoraje” instead of the more common “anclaje”, and some slightly stilted sentence structures). These do not break understanding but affect smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered (preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, ICL). The occasional choice of a less common word like “ancoraje” slightly reduces consistency, but the terminology remains accurate and consistent throughout.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish well, using appropriate register and culturally neutral expressions. The only minor drawback is the inconsistent handling of the podcast title (“Tecno Destello” vs the original “Tech Éclair”), which may be confusing for branding purposes.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the explanations remain faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality: it faithfully conveys the original content, uses appropriate technical vocabulary, and is largely readable and natural. Small fluency hiccups and a couple of terminology choices prevent it from being perfect, but the overall communication is effective and professional.\n\nScore out of 20: 18/20 (average of the individual criteria)."
