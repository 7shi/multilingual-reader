  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and conveys the original ideas. However, there are several distracting issues: the opening line mixes French and Spanish (\"Bonjour y bienvenido/a\"), inconsistent use of bold/italics, and occasional fragmented sentences (e.g., \"Luc: **afinamiento**\"). These reduce smooth comprehension, especially for a listener following a podcast script.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are awkward constructions and inconsistencies. Phrases such as \"Y soy **Luc. Hoy vamos a desvelar**\" break the flow, and the shift between \"vosotros\" and \"tú/usted\" creates a jarring register. Minor punctuation and formatting errors also detract from fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje contextual (ICL)\", \"grounding\" (explained as \"anclaje\"), and references to \"prompt\" and \"ventana de contexto\" are accurate and consistent. The translator kept abbreviations and provided appropriate Spanish equivalents where needed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the podcast tone, but cultural and linguistic adaptation is uneven. The title switches between \"Tech Flash\" and \"Tech Éclair\", which may confuse listeners. Mixing French greetings, using \"vosotros\" in a Latin‑American‑oriented Spanish text, and the occasional French‑Spanish hybrid reduce the sense that the content has been fully adapted for the target audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No substantive information is lost, and the logical progression of the dialogue is maintained.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the technical substance and overall structure of the original podcast script, and the terminology is largely spot‑on. Nevertheless, the readability and fluency suffer from mixed‑language artifacts, inconsistent pronoun usage, and formatting glitches that interrupt the listening experience. A cleaner, fully Spanish‑only version with consistent pronouns and a single, well‑chosen podcast title would raise the quality considerably."
