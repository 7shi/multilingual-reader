  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the podcast dialogue in a clear, logical way. Sentences are well‑structured and the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are easy to follow for a non‑expert audience. Minor typographical inconsistencies (e.g., occasional missing accents) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic, and the flow of the conversation feels smooth. A few passages are slightly literal (“memorización superficial”) and the use of bold tags (**Camille:** etc.) is inconsistent, but these do not create major awkwardness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: «preentrenamiento», «afinamiento», «aprendizaje por transferencia», «aprendizaje en contexto», «anclaje». When necessary, the French term is retained in parentheses (e.g., (grounding)), which helps readers familiar with the English jargon. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and tone of a podcast aimed at a general audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the use of Spanish quotation marks (« ») mirrors the original style. The adaptation does not introduce any culturally incongruent expressions.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are present: the distinction between pre‑training and fine‑tuning, the concept of transfer learning, the emergence of in‑context learning, the temporary nature of prompt‑provided knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features as a clever retrieval trick. No substantive information is omitted.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It successfully renders the technical discussion into fluent, understandable Spanish while preserving the original podcast’s educational tone. Minor stylistic issues (inconsistent bold markup, a few literal turns of phrase) prevent a perfect score, but they do not detract from the effectiveness of the translation.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 19/20."
