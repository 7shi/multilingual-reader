  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is difficult to follow because of grammatical errors (e.g., \"que modelar nuestro mundo\" instead of \"que modela nuestro mundo\"), awkward phrasing, and the presence of meta‑markers such as \"**Traducción final:**\" inside the dialogue. These interruptions break the flow and force the reader to re‑read sentences.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound unnatural to a native speaker: duplicated paragraphs, mixed languages (Italian \"conoscenze\"), and literal translations that ignore Spanish idiom. The insertion of notes and the inconsistent use of quotation marks further reduce the smoothness.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly rendered and consistent. However, occasional mistakes (e.g., \"conoscencias\") and the failure to translate the explanatory note about \"Traducción final\" show a lack of careful handling.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely preserves the original intent and explanatory style, but cultural and linguistic adaptation is marred by the inserted English/Spanish markers and by literal renderings that sound stilted. The overall message is conveyed, yet the presentation is not well adapted to Spanish‑speaking audiences.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French script are present, so no essential information is lost. The main drawback is the redundant \"Traducción final\" block that repeats content and adds noise, but it does not omit any key points.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the core concepts of the podcast but is plagued by numerous linguistic errors, unnecessary meta‑text, and occasional mixed‑language fragments. While the terminology is mostly accurate, the overall readability and fluency are low, making the transcript hard to consume for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Substantial editing is required to remove the duplicated notes, fix grammar, and smooth out awkward phrasing.\n\n**Overall score:** 51/100 (average of the five criteria). The translation needs thorough proofreading and stylistic revision to reach a professional level.\n\n**Detailed reasoning** is provided for each criterion above."
