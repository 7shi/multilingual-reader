  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is difficult to follow. Sentences are often fragmented, speaker tags are inconsistent (\"Lucas\" vs \"Luc\"), and many parenthetical notes and citations interrupt the flow. Several Spanish sentences are awkwardly constructed (e.g., \"Solo utiliza un sistema más inteligente para recuerda el contexto pasado\"), which hampers comprehension. While the core ideas are present, the reader must work hard to piece together the meaning.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains many unnatural expressions, literal translations, and grammatical errors. Examples include \"El aprendizaje por transferencia es la clave\" (acceptable) but later \"El modelo en sí no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus discusiones. Solo utiliza un sistema más inteligente para recuerda el contexto pasado\" (incorrect verb form). The mix of French fragments, English footnotes, and misplaced punctuation further reduces naturalness.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinación\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"ventana de contexto\" are correctly rendered, but the handling is inconsistent (e.g., \"ancraje\" instead of the proper \"anclaje\"; \"memoria\" function description is muddled). Some key concepts are explained, yet occasional mistranslations (\"Il\" → \"Ello\") and inconsistent use of proper nouns diminish clarity.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to adapt the podcast style to Spanish, but cultural and stylistic adjustments are uneven. The inclusion of citation details, mismatched speaker names, and untranslated French phrases shows a lack of proper contextual adaptation for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French are present, but some information is either duplicated, omitted, or inserted with unnecessary meta‑comments (e.g., \"CUTLER, R. (2020)\" citation, instructions about the user request). Redundancies and extraneous notes reduce the conciseness of the translation.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the overall structure and most of the technical content of the original podcast script, but it suffers from serious readability, fluency, and consistency issues. Inconsistent speaker labels, grammatical mistakes, literal renderings, and leftover editorial notes make the text feel more like a draft with annotation than a polished Spanish podcast transcript. Substantial editing is required to achieve a natural, coherent, and audience‑appropriate version.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 8/20.\n\nRecommendations: standardize speaker names, remove editorial comments, correct verb forms, replace incorrect neologisms (e.g., \"ancraje\" → \"anclaje\"), and smooth the flow of sentences to better match spoken Spanish style."
