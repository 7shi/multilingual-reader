    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original. Most sentences are easy to understand, but a few expressions (e.g., “aplastarse para un examen” instead of the more idiomatic “empollar” or “estudiar a último momento”) feel slightly odd and may momentarily confuse readers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, using appropriate vocabulary and sentence structures. Some phrasing is a bit clunky – for instance “Miren esto:” and “es como el bachillerato de último momento” – which sound less fluid to a native ear. Overall, it is smooth but not perfectly idiomatic.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “preentrenamiento”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL”, “grounding” → “anclaje”, and “prompt” are kept or correctly adapted. The term “afinado” for fine‑tuning is acceptable, though keeping the English in parentheses could aid clarity. Consistency is good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, and the examples are understandable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor cultural‑linguistic mismatches (e.g., the “aplastarse” choice) slightly reduce the adaptation quality, but the overall message is intact.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present; no substantive information is lost. The only tiny oversight is the leftover French word “Précisément” left untranslated, which does not affect meaning but is a minor completeness slip.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. It is readable and largely fluent, with correct terminology and almost complete information transfer. Minor idiomatic issues and a couple of awkward expressions prevent it from being perfect, but it would be easily understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 17/20."
