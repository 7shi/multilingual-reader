  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. The dialogue structure is preserved and complex concepts are explained in understandable terms. Minor issues such as the stray \"Final Translation:\" marker, missing punctuation after \"Camille: Es decir\" and occasional abrupt line breaks slightly disrupt flow, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural to a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and the sentences are well‑formed. However, a few expressions feel slightly awkward (e.g., \"una IA totalmente nueva\", \"Pueden tomar un modelo\"), and the leftover \"Final Translation:\" string breaks the fluency. Overall the text is smooth but not perfectly polished.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". The English term \"prompt\" is kept, which is standard in the field. Consistency is maintained throughout. Only a tiny inconsistency is the plural \"Pueden\" when referring to a singular model, but this does not affect understanding.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone of a podcast conversation. Cultural references are neutral and appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only slight mismatch is the phrase \"expansión masiva de la memoria de corto plazo\", which is a literal translation that, while understandable, could be expressed more idiomatically. Otherwise the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the technical explanations remain intact. The extraneous \"Final Translation:\" line is an artifact rather than a loss of information. Therefore the completeness is high.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It faithfully reproduces the original dialogue, maintains technical accuracy, and is largely readable and natural for Spanish speakers. Minor editorial oversights (a stray marker, a couple of punctuation issues, and a few slightly stiff phrasings) prevent a perfect score, but they do not diminish the overall effectiveness of the translation.\n\n**Total score (out of 100): 89/100**"
