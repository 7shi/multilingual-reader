  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is riddled with disjointed fragments, placeholder prompts (e.g., \"¡Hola, mundo!\", \"El resultado final es una traducción en español\"), and abrupt topic changes. A reader cannot follow the dialogue or grasp the flow of the podcast. The sentences do not form a coherent narrative, making comprehension extremely difficult.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains many unnatural constructions, repeated filler words, and literal translations that do not exist in natural Spanish conversation. Phrases such as \"El perro corre en el parque\" appear out of context, and the frequent insertion of English‑style instructions breaks the natural rhythm. Overall it sounds like a broken machine‑generated output rather than fluent Spanish.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms from the original (e.g., \"pré‑entraînement\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"apprentissage par transfert\", \"apprentissage en contexte\", \"ICL\", \"grounding\") are either omitted, mistranslated, or replaced by unrelated sentences. When they appear, they are not explained or consistently used, which would confuse a reader familiar with AI terminology.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to preserve the original intent: a clear, educational explanation of AI training methods. Cultural or contextual cues (such as the podcast format, the friendly banter between Camille and Luc) are lost, and many lines are replaced by irrelevant prompts. Consequently, the target audience does not receive the intended message.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A large portion of the original script is missing. Dialogues about pre‑training, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge are either absent or replaced by nonsensical filler. Important examples and analogies are lost, resulting in severe information loss.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is fundamentally broken. It does not convey the original podcast content, omits crucial information, and intersperses unrelated placeholders and instructions. Readability, fluency, terminology handling, contextual fidelity, and completeness are all far below acceptable standards for a professional translation. A complete re‑translation by a competent bilingual speaker with subject‑matter knowledge is required.\n\n**Score summary**: Readability 3/20, Fluency 2/20, Terminology 2/20, Contextual Adaptation 2/20, Information Completeness 1/20. The overall quality is extremely poor."
