  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation flows logically and the sentences are easy to follow. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained clearly. A few isolated phrases (e.g., the standalone “El pre‑entrenamiento.”) are slightly abrupt but do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the Spanish sounds natural and idiomatic. Minor awkwardness appears in the use of “bachotaje” (uncommon in many dialects) and the retained French term “ancrage”. The rest of the vocabulary and syntax are appropriate and fluid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled consistently: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, transferencia de aprendizaje, ventana de contexto, ICL, etc. The English “transfer learning” is italicised, which is acceptable. The only slight issue is keeping the French word “ancrage” instead of translating it to “anclaje”.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural references are neutral, and the explanation of memory features is clear for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The few retained French terms are the only deviation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No information from the original script is omitted. All examples, analogies, and clarifications are present, and the added phrase “entre bastidores” correctly conveys the hidden prompt insertion mechanism.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version is a high‑quality translation that conveys the technical content accurately and remains largely readable and natural. Small lexical choices (e.g., retaining French terms, the uncommon word “bachotaje”) prevent it from being perfect, but they do not detract significantly from the overall understanding. The translation is complete, technically sound, and well‑adapted to a Spanish‑speaking audience.\nScore: 18/20 (average of the five criteria)."
