  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. However, there are occasional redundancies (e.g., “Camille dice que,”) and a few awkward phrasings that can momentarily disrupt comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural, but several errors hurt fluency: duplicated speaker tags, missing or extra quotation marks, the use of “ancoraje” instead of the more common “anclaje,” and verb agreement mistakes such as “partimos” instead of “partes.” These issues make the translation feel less smooth for native speakers.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are largely preserved (preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning → afinamiento, ICL, grounding). The translation of “grounding” as “ancoraje” is uncommon, and the phrase “Aprendizaje In‑Contexto” mixes English and Spanish unnecessarily. Overall terminology is adequate but not perfectly consistent.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the podcast tone to Spanish well, using appropriate register and cultural references. Minor mis‑adaptations (e.g., “ventana de contexto” is fine, but “ancoraje” is not idiomatic) prevent a perfect fit.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French original are present; no significant content is omitted. Minor stylistic additions (like “Camille dice que”) do not alter meaning. The translation remains faithful to the source.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and retains the pedagogical flow of the podcast. Nonetheless, fluency suffers from several grammatical slips and a few non‑standard lexical choices. Terminology is mostly appropriate, though some terms could be rendered more idiomatically. Readability and completeness are solid, making the text understandable for Spanish‑speaking listeners, but polishing the language would raise the overall quality.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
