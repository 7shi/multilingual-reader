  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the dialogue format is preserved, making the technical discussion accessible. Minor hiccups (e.g., “Más bien,” instead of a smoother connector) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker overall. Most idiomatic expressions are correctly rendered (“consultor brillante”, “hoja de trucos”). A few literal choices (e.g., “el modelo mismo” and the use of “afinamiento” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”) feel slightly stiff, but the flow remains smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled appropriately: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, grounding (anclaje). Consistency is maintained, and when a term is less common (afinamiento) it is still understandable in context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the target audience’s cultural and linguistic expectations. The tone of a podcast is preserved, jokes and analogies are kept, and no French‑specific references remain untranslated. Slightly formal wording in a few spots could be softened, but overall the intent is fully conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original script is present. No ideas are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The only difference is the literal rendering of some punctuation (quotes inside quotes), which does not affect content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It delivers the original technical content in clear, mostly natural Spanish, preserving the conversational podcast style. Minor lexical choices (\"afinamiento\" vs. \"ajuste fino\", a few slightly literal connectors) keep the score just shy of perfect, but they do not detract from overall comprehension or accuracy.\nOverall score (out of 100): 89/100."
