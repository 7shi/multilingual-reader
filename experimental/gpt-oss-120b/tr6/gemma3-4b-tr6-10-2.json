    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the main ideas and most sentences are easy to follow. The flow of the dialogue remains clear, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can grasp. Minor hiccups (e.g., gender mismatches, occasional clumsy phrasing) slightly interrupt the smoothness but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds fairly natural, but there are several awkward expressions: *\"del bachotaje\"*, *\"las conocimientos\"*, *\"informaciones\"* (should be singular), and the redundant parenthetical for ICL. In addition, the mix of *\"afinamiento\"* and *\"ajuste fino\"* creates inconsistency. These issues make the text feel a bit stilted for native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved, but the handling is uneven. *\"pre‑entrenamiento\"*, *\"afinamiento\"*, *\"transferencia de aprendizaje\"* are appropriate, yet the French word *\"ancrage\"* is left untranslated, and *\"grounding\"* remains in English. The switch between *\"afinamiento\"* and *\"ajuste fino\"* is confusing. Consistency and full translation of specialized vocabulary would improve the score.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural references are neutral and therefore transferable. Small lapses (e.g., the use of *\"silla\"* for *\"selle\"*) are acceptable, but the translation could have better adapted some idiomatic expressions to Spanish (e.g., *\"del bachotaje\"* → *\"como un repaso intensivo\"*). Overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. The only slight omission is the explicit mention of the “Mémoire” feature after the question about it, but the subsequent lines cover its functioning. No critical information is lost.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the educational content of the podcast. It is generally understandable and faithful to the source, but it suffers from occasional grammatical slips, inconsistent terminology, and a few unnatural phrasing choices that prevent it from feeling completely native. Polishing these areas—especially making terminology consistent and fixing gender agreement—would raise the overall quality to a near‑native level."
