  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow; sentences are short and the podcast format is preserved. Minor issues such as the mixed gender form \"bienvenida/o\" and occasional stray quotation marks do not impede comprehension, but they slightly affect smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several unnatural constructions and formatting artifacts: the insertion of \"Luc dice:\" inside a quote, the use of markdown **bold**, and some literal translations that feel clunky (e.g., \"Puede tomar un modelo\" instead of \"Puedes tomar un modelo\"). Vocabulary is appropriate, but the flow is occasionally stilted.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are correctly rendered and consistent. The translation of \"grounding\" as \"referenciación\" is acceptable, though \"anclaje\" would be more common.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original podcast tone to Spanish well, using familiar analogies (consultor, estudiante) and respecting cultural expectations. A few literal renderings (e.g., \"consultor brillante\") are fine, and the overall intent is preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French original are present; no major content is omitted. Minor redundancies (extra quotation marks) and formatting noise do not remove information. The logical sequence of concepts is maintained.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and keeps the explanatory tone suitable for a podcast audience. However, it suffers from formatting remnants and occasional awkward phrasing that prevent it from sounding completely natural to native Spanish speakers. polishing the text (removing markdown, fixing gender forms and smoothing verb choices) would raise the fluency substantially.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 17/20."
