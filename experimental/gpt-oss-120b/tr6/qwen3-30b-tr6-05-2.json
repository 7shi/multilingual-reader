    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is fragmented with many unrelated interjections (e.g., “Hola”, “El texto traducido al español es el siguiente.”) and missing dialogue. Sentences do not follow a logical flow, making it extremely hard for a Spanish‑speaking reader to follow the conversation.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Numerous unnatural constructions, placeholder sentences, and repetitions betray a machine‑generated draft rather than a smooth, native‑like translation. The language feels disjointed and awkward.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino” and “aprendizaje en contexto” appear, but they are inconsistently used and often surrounded by irrelevant filler. No effort is made to explain or standardize terminology.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original podcast’s intent—to explain AI training concepts—is largely lost. Cultural or contextual cues are missing, and the translation inserts meta‑comments that do not belong in the dialogue.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A large portion of the original script is omitted or replaced by unrelated prompts (“Hola”, “Por favor, escribe en español”). Crucial explanations and examples are absent, resulting in severe information loss.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "overall_comment": "The supplied ‘translation’ is not a faithful rendering of the French source. It consists mostly of placeholder text, repeated greetings, and system messages, with only sparse fragments of the intended content. Readability, fluency, terminology handling, contextual fidelity, and completeness are all extremely low, rendering the translation unusable for any audience seeking the original podcast’s explanation of AI training methods.\n\nScore breakdown: 2 / 20 (readability) + 2 / 20 (fluency) + 4 / 20 (terminology) + 2 / 20 (contextual adaptation) + 1 / 20 (information completeness) = **11 / 100** overall."
