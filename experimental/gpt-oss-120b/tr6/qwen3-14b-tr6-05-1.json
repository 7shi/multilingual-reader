  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable. Sentences flow logically and the main ideas are clear, allowing a reader to follow the discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., \"las conocimientos\") do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several awkward or unidiomatic expressions: \"el aprendizaje en contexto es cramado\", \"una antiche\" (typo for \"una antisèche\"), and the question‑style sentence \"La diferencia entre estudiar…?\". These reduce the naturalness of the text for native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" and \"grounding\" are correctly rendered. The only inconsistency is keeping \"fine‑tuning\" in English rather than translating it to \"ajuste fino\", but the meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural references are neutral and appropriate. Small issues such as the typo \"antiche\" and occasional unnatural phrasing slightly weaken the adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present; no major ideas are omitted. The only loss is the misspelled word \"antiche\", which may cause a brief confusion but does not delete information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation conveys the technical content and conversational style of the original podcast effectively. It is readable and complete, but occasional unidiomatic phrasing and a typo prevent it from feeling fully native. Refining those small issues would raise the fluency and contextual adaptation scores.\n\nScore out of 100: 80/100."
