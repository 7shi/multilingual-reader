  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are conveyed clearly. Most sentences have logical structure, and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained in an understandable way. However, there are a few awkward phrasings (e.g., \"un memorizar de última hora\", \"el preentrenamiento\", inconsistencies in capitalization) that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several expressions feel literal or stilted. Phrases such as \"un memorizar de última hora\" are not idiomatic Spanish, and occasional missing accents or punctuation (e.g., \"Precísamente\" without accent) break the flow. Vocabulary choices are appropriate, yet the overall smoothness could be improved.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (AEC/ICL)\" and \"anclaje\" are all correctly rendered and consistent throughout. No important term is mistranslated or omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast discussion. Cultural references are minimal, and the chosen wording fits a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in technology. Minor issues (e.g., occasional literal translations) do not affect the overall message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No relevant detail is lost, and the dialogue structure is kept intact. The only minor deviation is formatting of speaker labels, which does not affect content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and faithfully conveys the technical discussion. It succeeds in delivering the key concepts and maintains the conversational style of the podcast. The main areas for improvement are fluency and readability, where a few idiomatic adjustments would make the text feel more natural to native Spanish speakers. Overall, the work is high‑quality and only needs minor polishing.\nOverall score (average): 17/20"
