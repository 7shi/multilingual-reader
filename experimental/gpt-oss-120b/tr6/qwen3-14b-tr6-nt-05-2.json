    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the concepts are clearly explained. Sentence structures are logical, and the flow of the dialogue mirrors the original. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., “Los nuevas conocimientos”, “Se tiene la impresión de que la IA se acuerda”) slightly hinder smooth comprehension, but they do not obscure meaning.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, but a few expressions feel awkward or overly literal: “Ustedes pueden” sounds formal for a podcast, “es una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado” is a bit clunky, and occasional agreement errors break the native‑speaker feel. Overall the language is fluent enough for a native audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is handled well. Key terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (In‑Context Learning)”, and “grounding (anclaje)” are preserved or appropriately translated, and the use of the English word “prompt” is acceptable in this context. One small mistake (“Los nuevas conocimientos”) shows a lapse, but terminology consistency is otherwise solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the podcast’s informal, conversational tone while adapting cultural references for Spanish‑speaking listeners. The use of “¡Exactamente!” and the explanatory style fit the target audience. The only drawback is the occasional use of “Ustedes” which feels too formal for a casual dialogue, but the overall intent and purpose are conveyed accurately.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No sections are omitted, and the logical progression of ideas (pre‑training → fine‑tuning → transfer learning → in‑context learning → memory tricks) is intact. Redundancy is minimal and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is strong overall, conveying the technical content and podcast style effectively. Minor grammatical and stylistic errors prevent it from being flawless, but they do not impede understanding. Technical terms are appropriately rendered, and the entire message of the original is preserved. With a few refinements—especially correcting agreement mistakes and smoothing some colloquial phrasing—the translation would be near‑native quality.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
