    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clearly presented. The dialogue format is preserved and the explanations of pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, etc., are understandable. Minor issues such as unnecessary quotation marks around the speakers and occasional overly literal phrasing slightly hinder the flow, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several spots that feel a bit awkward to a native speaker: mixed use of English/French terms (\"fine‑tuning\", \"pre‑entrenamiento\" with hyphen), redundant quotation marks, and phrasing like \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje contextual automatizado\" that could be smoother. Overall the language is comprehensible but not completely idiomatic.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely well‑handled: \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\". The only notable inconsistency is the retention of the English term \"fine‑tuning\" instead of the Spanish \"ajuste fino\", which could confuse readers unfamiliar with the English phrase. Apart from that, terminology is consistent and appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural references are neutral, and the Spanish wording is adapted well for a francophone‑to‑Spanish audience. Minor typographic quirks (quotes, brackets) do not affect the conveyed message. Overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the concepts, analogies, and details from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted, and the structure of the dialogue remains intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and keeps the educational flow intact. It is readable and complete, with solid handling of technical concepts. Fluency could be improved by smoothing out some literal translations and by fully localising terms like \"fine‑tuning\". With minor polishing, the text would read as a natural Spanish podcast dialogue."
