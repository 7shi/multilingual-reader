    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clearly expressed. Most sentences flow logically and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can grasp. Minor issues such as stray markdown (**bold**) markers, a misspelled name (\"Camila\" instead of \"Camille\"), and occasional redundant phrasing slightly detract from smooth reading, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward or literal renderings. \"ancraje\" is not a common Spanish term (\"anclaje\" would be preferred), and the mixture of English terms like \"fine‑tuning\" without translation feels a bit jarring. Some sentences are slightly wordy (e.g., \"Da la impresión de que la IA recuerda los detalles de mi proyecto, pero en realidad solo le proporcionaron un esquema justo antes de que empezara a hablar con usted\"). Overall, a native speaker would understand everything, but the prose could be smoother.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly preserved and understandable: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\". However, the use of \"fine‑tuning\" in English rather than the Spanish equivalent \"ajuste fino\" introduces inconsistency, and \"ancraje\" is a questionable translation for \"grounding\". The handling is adequate but not optimal.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone well. Cultural references are kept appropriate, and the explanatory style matches the podcast format. Minor formatting glitches and the name typo are the only noticeable slips. The overall adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience is successful.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present. No major ideas are omitted, and the added clarifications (e.g., \"Da la impresión de que la IA recuerda…\") are accurate and do not introduce misinformation. Redundancy is minimal, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is faithful and largely clear, capturing the educational tone of the original podcast. It succeeds in delivering the technical content to a Spanish‑speaking audience. The main areas for improvement are polishing the naturalness of certain expressions, standardising technical terminology (especially avoiding mixed‑language terms), and fixing minor typographical/formatting errors. With these tweaks, the translation would reach a very high professional standard."
