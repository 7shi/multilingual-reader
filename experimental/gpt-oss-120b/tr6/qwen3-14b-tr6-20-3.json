  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are clear. Minor punctuation quirks do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally in most places, but a few expressions feel awkward or literal: “Vean ustedes”, “¿Por qué ya comprende…?” (should be “¿Por qué ya comprende…?” or “¿Porque ya comprende…?”), and the retention of English loanwords such as “cheat sheet”. These issues lower the overall smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely handled correctly – pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, etc. The only notable deviation is keeping the French word “ancrage” instead of using the Spanish “anclaje” or “enraizamiento”, and leaving “cheat sheet” untranslated. Consistency is otherwise good.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast tone and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., “consultor brillante”). Small lapses like the unchanged English term “cheat sheet” and the occasional literal rendering do not significantly affect the intended message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and the flow of the dialogue is maintained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is very solid. It conveys the full content, keeps the technical depth, and is mostly readable and natural for Spanish‑speaking listeners. A few stylistic refinements (removing leftover English terms, smoothing some literal constructions, and translating ‘ancrage’) would push the fluency and terminology scores higher, but the current version is already highly functional and faithful to the original."
