  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and follows the original flow. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., \"Se percibe a menudo estas IAs\" instead of \"se perciben\") and occasional clunky phrasing slightly hinder smooth reading, but the main ideas remain clear.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several unnatural constructions and literal translations (e.g., \"el memorizado\", duplicated bicycle analogy, and occasional agreement errors). While a native speaker can follow the text, the style feels somewhat robotic and occasionally awkward.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" and \"grounding\" are correctly retained and used consistently. Some terms could have been fully Spanish‑ized (e.g., \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\"), but overall the terminology is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast’s informal, conversational tone and the educational intent. Cultural references are neutral and suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor repetition errors (the bicycle analogy) slightly affect the adaptation, but the overall message is conveyed correctly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key points from the original script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory vs. forgetting, and the “Memoria” feature. No substantial content is omitted, and the logical sequence is maintained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of conveying the technical content and the podcast’s conversational style. Grammar and stylistic issues prevent it from feeling fully natural, and a few literal renderings could be improved. Nevertheless, the essential information and terminology are well preserved, making it a functional and largely accurate Spanish version.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 16/20."
