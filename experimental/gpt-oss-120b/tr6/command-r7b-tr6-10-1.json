    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the logical flow of the original dialogue. However, there are several grammatical slips (e.g., “desciframos la tecnología que modelar nuestro mundo” missing the verb *modela*, “conoscencias” – an Italian word – and odd punctuation) that can momentarily confuse readers. The duplicated block marked “**Traducción final:**” also breaks the reading rhythm. Because of these hiccups the text is not as smooth as it could be.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly uses natural‑sounding Spanish, but the presence of literal constructions (“una IA completamente nueva a la escuela”) and the repeated “**Traducción final:**” segment make parts feel mechanical. Some expressions are slightly awkward (e.g., “la IA no “olvida” en el sentido humano; su espacio de trabajo temporal simplemente se vacía”) and a few English fragments remain (ICL, fine‑tuning). These issues prevent full fluency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as «pre‑entrenamiento», «ajuste fino», «aprendizaje por transferencia», «ventana de contexto» and «aprendizaje en contexto» are correctly rendered and consistent. The abbreviation ICL is kept, which is appropriate for the target audience. Minor inconsistencies appear (e.g., “conoscencias” and the occasional English word), but overall the terminology is well handled.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the podcast tone and the explanatory style, adapting cultural references where needed. Nevertheless, the odd insertion of the “Traducción final” tags and the duplicated content detract from a polished adaptation. Aside from those artefacts, the intent and purpose of the original are conveyed.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No substantive information is lost, although some sentences are duplicated, which is redundant but does not omit content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in transmitting the core technical concepts of the original French podcast and uses appropriate terminology for a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, the presence of formatting artefacts (the '**Traducción final:**' markers), duplicated passages, occasional grammatical errors, and a few lexical slips (Italian word, stray English terms) reduce readability and fluency. A clean edit that removes the duplicated block, corrects the minor language errors, and smooths a few literal renderings would raise the quality substantially.\nOverall score (average): 15.2/20."
