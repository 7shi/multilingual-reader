  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the complex ideas about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can understand. Minor issues such as occasional formal‑informal pronoun switches (\"Usted\" vs. \"tú\") do not significantly impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, using appropriate Spanish idioms and syntax. There are a few stiff or overly formal constructions (e.g., \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\", \"El afinamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\") and some punctuation quirks, but overall the flow is smooth and sounds like a native speaker produced it.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento (fine‑tuning), aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), grounding → \"anclaje\", etc. Consistency is maintained throughout the transcript. The only minor point is the choice of \"afinamiento\" instead of the more widespread \"ajuste fino\", but the meaning is preserved.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French content well for a Spanish‑speaking audience, preserving the podcast tone and the consultant‑analogy. Slight inconsistencies in register (mix of \"usted\" and \"tú\") and occasional literal translations (e.g., \"prompt\") could be refined, but the intent and cultural relevance remain intact.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original script is retained. No sentences or concepts are omitted, and the logical progression of ideas is preserved. The translation also keeps the examples and analogies, ensuring full coverage of the source material.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical concepts accurately, reads fluently, and is largely faithful to the source. Minor stylistic adjustments (consistent pronoun use, smoother phrasing for some formal sentences, and a possible alternative for \"afinamiento\") would bring it even closer to native‑speaker standards, but the current version is already very effective for its intended audience.\n\n**Overall Score:** 18/20 (average of the five criteria)."
