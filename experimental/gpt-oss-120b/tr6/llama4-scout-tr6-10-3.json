  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable. Sentences are generally clear and the flow follows the original dialogue. A few long sentences could be split for easier reading, and some punctuation (e.g., double speaker labels) distracts, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are occasional awkward constructions (e.g., \"Es pues una memoria de uso único\", \"Mejor dicho:\", \"el afinamiento\"). The use of quotation marks and speaker tags is inconsistent, which gives a slightly stilted impression. Vocabulary choices are appropriate, but the overall smoothness could be improved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\" (although rendered as \"afinamiento\" later), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"grounding\" are correctly translated. Minor inconsistency in using \"afinamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\" does not cause misunderstanding but breaks consistency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural references are neutral, and the explanations remain accessible to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Some expressions could be refined for a more idiomatic feel, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the technical details are retained. The only slight redundancy is the repeated speaker labels with extra quotation marks, which does not affect content completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. Minor issues with punctuation, occasional unnatural phrasing, and inconsistency in terminology prevent it from being flawless, but the core message and details are preserved. With a few stylistic tweaks, it would read like a native‑written podcast script.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
