  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the logical flow of the original. However, a few untranslated French fragments (e.g., “Le pré‑entraînement.”) and occasional awkward phrasing make it slightly harder for a native reader to follow smoothly.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound natural, but there are noticeable inconsistencies (mix of \"Usted\" and \"tú\", occasional literal translations, and typographical errors like \"мнера\"). These affect the overall smoothness.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"fine‑tuning\", \"transfer learning\", \"In‑Context Learning\", and \"ventana de contexto\" are correctly rendered. The occasional retention of French terms does not impede understanding, and the glossary‑style explanations are appropriate.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone reasonably well, using equivalents like \"consultor brillante\". Nonetheless, register shifts (formal vs. informal) and minor misspellings reduce cultural coherence.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are present; no major content is omitted. Minor typographical errors (e.g., \"мнера\") do not cause loss of meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original message accurately and retains most of the technical nuance. Readability and completeness are strong, but fluency and stylistic consistency suffer from a few literal translations and typographical mistakes. A modest polish would bring it to a near‑native quality level.\nScore out of 20 (average of criteria): 15"
