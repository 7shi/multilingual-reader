    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and the logical flow of the dialogue is preserved. However, occasional mixed‑language fragments (e.g., “C’est donc una memoria…”, “antisèche”) and minor grammatical slips (e.g., “para le dar”) slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural but contains several awkward constructions and punctuation errors. Missing opening ¡/¿ marks, literal translations (“para le dar”, “bachotage”) and French words left in the Spanish version make the prose feel stilted.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning”, “ICL” and “aprendizaje por transferencia” are correctly rendered. Nevertheless, some terms are left in French (e.g., “ancrage”, “antisèche”) or not fully adapted, which reduces consistency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and conversational tone are preserved, and cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The occasional retention of French words and the literal “consultor brillante” expression slightly reduce the natural cultural fit.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas, examples, and analogies from the original French script are present. No substantive information is lost; only minor stylistic redundancies appear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and retains the educational tone of the podcast. It is fairly readable and complete, but fluency suffers from mixed‑language insertions, punctuation issues, and a few literal renderings that feel unnatural in Spanish. Improving consistency of terminology and polishing the phrasing would raise the overall quality considerably."
