  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and follows a logical flow, making the concepts understandable. However, there is a noticeable typo – \"cramar\" – which is not a Spanish word and can confuse readers. Minor phrasing issues (e.g., \"exponérselo\") also slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural, but several expressions are awkward or overly literal translations (e.g., \"Miren cómo funciona\", \"exponérselo\", mixed use of \"tus\" and \"vuestras\"). These quirks break the natural rhythm expected by native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\", \"anclaje\" are correctly rendered and consistently used. The only minor lapse is the non‑standard word \"cramar\" which is unrelated to terminology.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and adapts the discussion to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are preserved, and the explanatory tone remains appropriate. Inconsistencies in pronoun choice (tú vs. vosotros) and the typo \"cramar\" slightly weaken the adaptation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the structure mirrors the source closely, keeping the content complete and coherent.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid overall, delivering the full content with appropriate technical language. Readability and fluency are affected by a few lexical errors (notably \"cramar\" and some clunky phrasing) and slight inconsistencies in pronoun usage. Terminology and completeness are strong points. With minor edits to correct the typo and smooth out awkward expressions, the translation would be near‑perfect for native Spanish listeners.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 85/100.\n\nRecommendations: replace \"cramar\" with \"empollar\" or \"estudiar intensamente\", revise \"Miren cómo funciona\" to \"Veamos cómo funciona\", adjust \"exponérselo\" to \"exponerle\" or \"presentarle\", and maintain consistent pronouns (preferably \"tus\" throughout)."
