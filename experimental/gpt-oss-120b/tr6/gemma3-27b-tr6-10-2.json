    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the complex AI concepts are explained clearly. Sentences are generally short and easy to follow. Minor issues such as a stray period after “El preentrenamiento.” and occasional mixed registers (formal «usted» vs. informal «tus») slightly affect smoothness, but overall a Spanish‑speaking reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. A few constructions feel slightly awkward (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto, es como estudiar intensivamente para un examen.” with an unnecessary comma, and the switch between formal and informal pronouns). The use of the English term “grounding” without a Spanish equivalent is acceptable but a bit jarring. These small hiccups keep the fluency just short of perfect.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, memoria a corto plazo, etc. The decision to keep “grounding” in English is debatable, but it is clearly introduced and the meaning is preserved. No important term is mistranslated or omitted.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone, adapting idiomatic expressions (e.g., “bachotage” becomes “estudiar intensivamente para un examen”). Cultural references are neutral and suitable for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The mixed formal/informal pronoun usage slightly reduces cohesion, but the overall adaptation is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information present in the French script is retained in the Spanish version. No relevant detail is lost, and the examples (consultant, bicycle, etc.) are all kept. Redundancies are not introduced, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It faithfully reproduces the content and technical nuances of the original French podcast script, making the material accessible to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor issues such as inconsistent register, a stray comma, and the untranslated term “grounding” prevent it from being flawless, but they do not hinder comprehension. The translation would be ready for publication after a quick editorial pass to harmonize pronouns and polish a couple of phrasing details."
