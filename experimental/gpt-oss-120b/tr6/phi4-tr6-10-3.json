    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original French dialogue. Most sentences are easy to understand, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener could follow. A few awkward phrasings (e.g., “cursar apuros” and “bachotaje”) slightly hinder smooth comprehension, but they do not break the overall intelligibility.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, using appropriate vocabulary and syntax for native Spanish speakers. Minor issues such as missing opening exclamation marks, occasional literal calques (e.g., “el aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje”) and a few overly long sentences make it feel slightly translated rather than fully native.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “anclaje (grounding)”, “memoria a corto plazo”. The occasional inclusion of the English acronym (ICL) mirrors the source and helps comprehension. No important term is lost or mis‑translated.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral, and the examples remain relevant for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The only slight mismatch is the use of “bachotaje”, a neologism that may sound odd to many readers; a more common phrase would be “estudiar de memoria”.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No sections are omitted, and the logical order of the discussion is maintained. The translation even keeps the parenthetical explanations of English terms, ensuring full fidelity.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, retains the conversational tone of the podcast, and includes all relevant information. Minor lexical choices and a few stylistic quirks prevent a perfect score, but the text is easily understandable and faithful to the source.\n\nStrengths: consistent terminology, complete information transfer, clear explanations. Areas for improvement: smoother idiomatic expressions (replace “bachotaje” with a more common term), better punctuation, and slight sentence shortening for readability.\n\nFinal aggregated score (out of 100): 90/100."
