  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure, but several sentences are awkward or contain grammatical errors that hinder smooth reading. Examples include “Imagínense que se envían una nueva IA a la escuela” (incorrect verb‑subject agreement) and “El aprendizaje en contexto, es un aplastamiento” (incorrect word choice). These issues require the reader to pause and reinterpret, lowering overall readability.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many non‑native constructions and lexical slips: “Vea:” as an interjection, “antiesencia” for the French “antisèche”, inconsistent use of formal \"Usted\" and informal \"tú\", and the odd phrase “es un aplastamiento”. Such mistakes make the prose feel stilted and occasionally confusing, so the fluency is limited.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL* are preserved and understandable. However, a few terms are mistranslated or poorly rendered (e.g., “aplastamiento” for “cramming”, “antiesencia” for “antisèche”). Overall consistency is good, but the occasional mis‑rendering prevents a perfect score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the podcast tone and the educational intent, but cultural adaptation is uneven. It fails to use idiomatic Spanish equivalents (e.g., “chuleta” instead of “antiesencia”) and mixes formal and informal pronouns, which can feel inconsistent to a Spanish‑speaking audience. The core message is preserved, yet the adaptation could be smoother.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present; no major ideas are omitted. Minor nuances are slightly altered due to the mistranslation of “cramming” and “antisèche”, but the overall content remains complete and faithful to the source.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full content of the original podcast and retains most technical terminology, which is a strong point. Nevertheless, frequent grammatical slips, unnatural phrasing, and occasional incorrect lexical choices affect readability and fluency. Cultural adaptation could be refined, especially regarding idiomatic expressions and consistent pronoun usage. With targeted editing to correct the highlighted errors, the translation could reach a much higher quality level."
