    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow, sentences are well‑structured and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor punctuation quirks do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, but a few expressions feel slightly informal or literal (e.g., “chivatazo”, “en lugar de enviarlo a un programa de formación de varios años”). These do not break the flow but prevent a perfect native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered (preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, anclaje, ventana de contexto). Where necessary, the original English acronym is kept in parentheses, which is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast’s tone for a Spanish‑speaking audience and even localises the final show name to “Tecno Relámpago”. The only inconsistency is the opening line that keeps the original French title “Tech Éclair”, which could have been fully adapted.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples and nuances from the French original are preserved. No important information is omitted, and the explanatory depth remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains readable, and largely sounds natural in Spanish. Minor issues with informality and a small inconsistency in the podcast name keep it from being flawless, but the translation is effective for its intended audience.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 18, Fluency 17, Terminology 19, Contextual Adaptation 16, Information Completeness 18. Total: 88/100.\n\nRecommendations: replace colloquial \"chivatazo\" with a more neutral term like \"hoja de trucos\" or \"resumen\", and ensure consistent localisation of proper nouns throughout the script.\n\nOverall rating: 88/100."
