  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the ideas clearly, sentences are well‑structured and the flow mirrors the original. No major ambiguities or missing explanations, only a few long sentences that could be split for easier reading.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall. Minor Anglicisms such as “prompt”, “cheat sheet” and occasional literal calques (e.g., “levantar el velo”) are present, but they do not hinder comprehension and are common in tech contexts.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “grounding”. Consistency is maintained; the few English borrowings are acceptable in a technical podcast.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the target audience’s cultural and linguistic expectations. The tone remains conversational and the examples stay relevant. Small English insertions could be replaced by Spanish equivalents for full adaptation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No concepts are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary material.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality: it faithfully reproduces the content, uses appropriate technical language, and is largely natural for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor English loanwords prevent a perfect score, but they are typical in tech discourse and do not affect overall understanding.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
