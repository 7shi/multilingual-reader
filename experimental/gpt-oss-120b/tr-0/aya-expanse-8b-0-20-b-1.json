    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the dialogue flow is easy to follow. Most complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained in understandable terms. However, there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., “¿qué es?” after a statement, “se acuerda” instead of “recuerda”) that slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are noticeable non‑native phrases: “se acuerda”, the stray French word “antisèche”, the unnecessary question tag “¿qué es?” and the inconsistent use of “Tech Luz” instead of the original title. These issues break the natural flow for native Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is well‑handled: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, grounding → anclaje, etc. Consistency is maintained throughout. The only lapse is the untranslated French term “antisèche” and the title change, which slightly detracts from precision.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone of a podcast conversation. Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor missteps (the title “Tech Luz” and the French loanword) prevent a perfect adaptation, but overall the message is preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning, the analogy of a consultant vs. a permanent expert, and the explanation of memory‑like features. The only omissions are the untranslated term “antisèche” and the title change, which are small but noticeable.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of rendering a technically dense French podcast into Spanish. The core concepts are accurately transmitted and the dialogue remains engaging. Nevertheless, a few lexical slips (untranslated French word, odd verb choice, title alteration) reduce the naturalness and fidelity. With minor revisions, the text would be fluent, fully idiomatic, and perfectly faithful to the source.\nOverall rating (average of the five criteria): 16/20.\n\nScore: 16"
