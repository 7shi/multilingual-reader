  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the original flow, but there are several interruptions that hurt smooth comprehension. Phrases such as “Es decir, en otras palabras, esto es, o bien, o sea” are nonsensical, and the duplicate speaker label “Camille: Camille:” creates momentary confusion. Minor typographical errors (e.g., “informaciónes”) also force the reader to pause. These issues lower the readability despite the overall clarity of the concepts.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural, but a number of awkward constructions and literal translations remain. Examples include “¿No es porque ya entiende…?” (acceptable but slightly clunky), “crunchar (estudiar intensivamente)” (the English‑derived verb feels out of place), and the malformed filler mentioned above. The mix of French‑style punctuation and occasional missing accents also detracts from native‑speaker fluency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Core terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto* (ICL), and *grounding*/*anclaje* are correctly translated or retained with appropriate explanations. The occasional retention of English words like *prompt* is acceptable in a tech podcast context. Overall, terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the educational tone and the podcast dialogue format, adapting cultural references appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, the presence of the garbled filler phrase and a few unnatural speaker labels slightly weakens the adaptation. Apart from these glitches, the intent and style of the original are well conveyed.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original script is present. No major ideas are omitted, and the examples (English‑to‑French transfer, memory vs. fine‑tuning) are retained. Minor typographical errors do not cause loss of meaning, so completeness is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in delivering the technical content of the original podcast in Spanish, with accurate terminology and faithful preservation of the dialogue’s educational purpose. Nonetheless, readability and fluency suffer from a few incoherent insertions, duplicated speaker tags, and occasional awkward phrasing. Correcting these issues would bring the text to a higher professional standard.\nOverall rating (average of criteria): 16/20."
