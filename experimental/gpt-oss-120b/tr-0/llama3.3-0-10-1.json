    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. However, there is a noticeable typo where Camille’s line ends with “Es decir, ¿” and is cut off, which interrupts the flow. Additionally, the mix of formal “Usted” and informal “tú” pronouns creates slight confusion. These issues lower the overall ease of reading.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural, but a few expressions are awkward (e.g., “Usted ha entendido todo.”, “Así es la realidad del ICL.”). The register shifts between formal and informal, and punctuation errors (missing question marks, commas) affect smoothness. Nonetheless, a native speaker would understand without major effort.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje, prompt, etc. The terminology is consistent and appropriate for a technically‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural adaptation is adequate, though the occasional formal‑informal mix and the incomplete line reduce the seamless adaptation to Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are conveyed. The only loss is the truncated fragment “Es decir, ¿”, which omits a brief rhetorical question, but the surrounding context still makes the meaning clear. No major content is omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and faithfully renders the technical discussion, but it suffers from a few typographical errors, an incomplete sentence, and some register inconsistencies that affect readability and fluency. Technical terminology is accurate and the core information is preserved.\n\nStrengths: correct handling of specialized terms, clear explanation of concepts, faithful preservation of the podcast’s educational tone.\nWeaknesses: a truncated line, mixed formality, occasional awkward phrasing, minor punctuation issues.\n\nWith a final polish to fix the missing fragment and unify the register, the translation would be excellent.\n\nScore: 80/100 (average of the five criteria)."
