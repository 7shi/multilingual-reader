    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can understand. The only minor obstacle is the use of the Portuguese‑ish word “afinado” for fine‑tuning, which may cause a brief pause for some readers.",

    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, but a few lexical choices feel odd for native Spanish speakers (e.g., “afinado” instead of “afinamiento” or “ajuste fino”, “anclaje” for grounding). These occasional slips prevent the text from being completely smooth.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well‑handled: “preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, and the use of the English acronyms are appropriate. The inconsistency with “afinado” and the less‑common translation of “grounding” as “anclaje” slightly detract from precision.",

    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational tone of the original podcast is preserved, and cultural references are adapted correctly (e.g., greeting, use of exclamation marks). The intent and purpose of each segment are conveyed accurately.",

      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is retained. No significant details are omitted or added unnecessarily; the content remains faithful to the original.",

    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is very good. It conveys the full meaning of the original podcast and is mostly readable and natural for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor lexical issues (mainly the use of ‘afinado’ and occasional uncommon word choices) prevent a perfect score, but they do not hinder comprehension.\n\nStrengths: accurate conveyance of technical concepts, good adaptation of the dialogue style, complete coverage of the source material.\nWeaknesses: a few non‑standard terms that feel borrowed from Portuguese and occasional slightly awkward phrasing.\n\nThe translation would benefit from replacing “afinado” with a standard Spanish term such as “afinamiento” or “ajuste fino”, and possibly using “anclaje” alternatives like “referenciación” or keeping the English “grounding” in italics for clarity. With those tweaks, the text would achieve native‑level fluency.\n\nScore (average of criteria): 18/20"
