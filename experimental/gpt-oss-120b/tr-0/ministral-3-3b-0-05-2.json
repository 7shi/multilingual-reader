    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the logical flow mirrors the original French script. Listeners can follow the discussion of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning without major confusion. Minor hiccups (e.g., a typo “informaciónes” and occasional long sentences) slightly affect smoothness, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several phrases are awkward or overly literal: “Vea: no se le enseñaría a un brillante físico…”, “crunchar” (an English‑Spanish hybrid that is not common in Spanish), and mixed language terms such as “el *afinamiento* (o *tuning*)”. Punctuation around quotes is sometimes inconsistent. These issues lower the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Core terms like «pré‑entraînement», «fine‑tuning», «transfer learning», «ventana de contexto», «aprendizaje en contexto» and «grounding» are either kept in the original language with quotation marks or correctly rendered in Spanish. The consistency is high, and the audience familiar with AI will understand without additional explanation.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original intent and tone of the podcast. Cultural references are minimal, and the Spanish version keeps the informal, conversational style. The use of the Anglicism “crunchar” and a few literal translations slightly reduce cultural adaptation, but overall the text feels appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the concepts, examples, and analogies from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted; only minor typographical errors appear, which do not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency suffers from a few literal renderings and non‑native slang. Minor typographical errors and inconsistent punctuation prevent a perfect score, but the text remains useful and faithful to the source.\nScore breakdown: Readability 16/20, Fluency 14/20, Terminology 18/20, Contextual Adaptation 16/20, Information Completeness 19/20. The translation demonstrates good competence with room for refinement in naturalness and polish.\nOverall score: 16.6/20 (rounded to 17)."
