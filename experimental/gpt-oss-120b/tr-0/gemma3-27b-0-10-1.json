  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and the sentences flow logically. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can follow. A few sentences are slightly long, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural to a native speaker. Most expressions are idiomatic, but there are a couple of mildly awkward phrases (e.g., “una forma inteligente de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”, “el modelo en sí no aprende ni evoluciona”). These do not break the flow but prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, etc. The choice of “anclaje” for “grounding” is acceptable, though some practitioners might prefer to keep the English term. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are neutral, and the examples (consultor brillante, consultor temporal) are adapted smoothly for Spanish‑speaking audiences. No inappropriate literal translations are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is retained. No sections are omitted, and the meaning of each passage is preserved. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy nor leave out essential details.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality: it conveys the technical content accurately, remains readable, and sounds natural for Spanish listeners. Minor stylistic adjustments could improve fluency, but the work is essentially complete and faithful to the source.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18.2 ≈ 18/20.\nOverall score: 18"
