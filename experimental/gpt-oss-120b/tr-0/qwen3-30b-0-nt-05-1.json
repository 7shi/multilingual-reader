  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the dialogue flows naturally. Minor issues such as inconsistent hyphenation (pre‑entrenamiento vs preentrenamiento) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the text sounds natural, but a few expressions feel literal or uncommon (e.g., “el afinado” instead of “el ajuste fino”, “montar en la silla” instead of “montar en bicicleta”). These occasional awkward phrases prevent a perfect fluency rating.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, grounding → anclaje, etc. The choice “afinado” for fine‑tuning is understandable, though “ajuste fino” would be more standard. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references well (consultor brillante, documentos de información). However, a few literal renderings (e.g., “montar en la silla”) sound odd for Spanish‑speaking audiences, slightly reducing the adaptation quality.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French source is preserved. No significant details are omitted, and the explanations remain intact. Redundancies are not introduced, keeping the content concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical discussion accurately and is largely readable and fluent. Minor lexical choices (especially for fine‑tuning and the bicycle analogy) and occasional literal phrasing prevent it from reaching the highest tier, but the overall quality is high and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\nOverall score: 88/100.\n\n**Breakdown**: Readability 18, Fluency 17, Terminology 18, Contextual Adaptation 15, Information Completeness 20.\nThe translation is solid, with only a few stylistic tweaks needed for perfect native‑speaker naturalness."
