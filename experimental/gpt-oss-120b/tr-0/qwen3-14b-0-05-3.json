  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are generally short and logical, and the technical explanations are kept clear. Minor hiccups such as occasional word order issues do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most of the text, but a few expressions feel slightly stiff or literal (e.g., \"por lo tanto, después del pre‑entrenamiento\", \"competencia permanente\"). Overall, a native speaker would understand it without effort, though a polished rewrite could improve smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently and correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, etc. No mistranslations or missing jargon are observed.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast script. It adapts idioms appropriately (e.g., \"una hoja de ayuda\") and respects Spanish‑speaking audience expectations, with only minor room for stylistic refinement.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is retained. No sentences or concepts are omitted, and the logical flow remains intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate, complete, and mostly natural. It conveys the technical concepts clearly and keeps the conversational podcast style. A few phrasing choices could be smoother, but they do not affect overall understanding. The work is high‑quality and ready for publication with minimal editorial polishing.\nOverall Score (out of 100): 91"
