  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow; sentences convey the original ideas clearly and the flow of the podcast dialogue is preserved. A few long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but overall the content is comprehensible for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural. Most expressions are idiomatic (e.g., “consultor brillante”, “ventana de contexto”). Some phrasing is slightly awkward or overly literal, such as “bambalinas” for “behind the scenes”, “cheat sheet” left in English, and “bachatear” which is not a common verb in Spanish. These do not hinder understanding but reduce the naturalness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “In‑Context Learning (ICL)”, “grounding” → “anclaje”. The occasional retention of English words (fine‑tuning, cheat sheet) is acceptable in a tech‑focused podcast, and the translations are consistent throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking tech audience. Minor issues like “bachatear” (a neologism) could be replaced with a more common phrase, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is omitted, and the supplemental explanations (e.g., the analogy of the consultant) are retained. Redundancies are not introduced.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and faithfully conveys the original podcast script. It is clear, mostly natural, and technically accurate. Minor lexical choices and a few slightly stiff constructions keep it just short of perfect fluency, but they do not impede comprehension. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking tech audience.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18 out of 20."
