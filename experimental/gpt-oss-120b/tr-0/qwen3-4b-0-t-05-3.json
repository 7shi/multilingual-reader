    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original. Most sentences are easy to understand, but a few awkward phrasings (e.g., “es apretar” for “c’est du bachotage”, “Usted ha entendido todo”) and occasional punctuation issues slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural to native speakers: the literal translation of “antisèche” is left untranslated, the use of “Usted ha entendido todo” is odd, and “es apretar” is not a correct idiom for ‘cramming’. Overall the translation is comprehensible but not fully natural.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, afinamiento, etc., are correctly rendered and used consistently. Minor issues like the redundant parenthesis around «anclaje» do not affect understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the formal podcast tone and adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Use of “usted” is consistent, and cultural references are appropriate. The only drawback is the untranslated French slang “antisèche”, which could have been replaced by a Spanish equivalent (“chuleta”).",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present, and no crucial information is omitted. The only loss is the meaning of the French word “antisèche”, which remains untranslated, slightly reducing completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical discussion accurately and retains most of the original’s structure and intent. It is readable and technically precise, but occasional literal translations and awkward phrasing prevent it from sounding fully natural. Addressing the few unnatural expressions and translating slang terms would raise the quality substantially."
