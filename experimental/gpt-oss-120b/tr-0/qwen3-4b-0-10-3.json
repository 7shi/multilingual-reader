  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clearly presented. Most sentences keep a logical flow and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. There are a few minor issues (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenido en\" instead of \"Hola y bienvenido a\", and the slightly abrupt \"Yo veo.\") that slightly affect smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, but there are occasional awkward phrasings such as \"bienvenido en\", \"Yo veo\", and the use of exclamation marks that feel a bit forced. Vocabulary choice is appropriate, yet a native speaker would likely phrase some sentences differently. Overall the text is understandable but not fully idiomatic.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are all rendered accurately. The occasional retention of English acronyms (ICL, grounding) is acceptable in a technical podcast context. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural adaptation is mostly adequate, though the opening greeting could be more idiomatic for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The overall message and humor are retained.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant details are omitted, and the structure mirrors the source. Minor typographic quirks do not affect the conveyed content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. It is readable and mostly fluent, with only a handful of non‑idiomatic expressions that prevent it from being completely natural. Technical terminology is well managed, and the original meaning is fully retained. Minor stylistic tweaks would bring it to a near‑perfect level.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16.8 → 17/20."
