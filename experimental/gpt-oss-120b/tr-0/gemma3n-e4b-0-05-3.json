  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version flows logically and the ideas are clearly expressed. Most sentences are easy to follow, and complex concepts such as transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑expert can grasp. A few sentences are a little long or could be split for smoother reading, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a handful of awkward constructions (e.g., \"es una forma astucia de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\", \"una libreta de apuntes\") and minor grammatical slips. Native speakers would understand everything, yet the phrasing could be polished to reach native‑like fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\" are all retained or appropriately translated. Consistency is maintained throughout, and the occasional use of the English term in parentheses helps the reader recognize the original concept.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the target audience’s cultural and linguistic background. Metaphors like \"consultor brillante\" and analogies with studying for an exam work well in Spanish. Minor issues such as the literal rendering of \"una libreta de apuntes\" could be refined, but the overall intent and tone are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present. No key points are omitted, and the speaker turns and explanations remain intact. The translation is slightly longer in places but does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality: it conveys the technical content accurately and is generally clear and readable. A few awkward phrasing choices and minor grammatical errors prevent it from being perfectly native‑like, but they do not impede understanding. With a light edit for fluency, it would be an excellent Spanish version of the podcast script.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 86/100."
