  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Sentences are mostly clear, though some are long, which slightly hampers quick comprehension. Overall, a native Spanish speaker can understand the discussion without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds generally natural, but a few literal renderings betray the source language (e.g., “el afinado” instead of the more idiomatic “ajuste fino”, inconsistent capitalization of “aprendizaje en Contexto”). Vocabulary is appropriate, yet occasional phrasing feels a bit stiff.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “grounding” → “anclaje”. The main drawback is the translation of “fine‑tuning” as “el afinado”, which is less common in AI literature, where “ajuste fino” is preferred. Consistency is otherwise good.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., “consultor brillante”). No major cultural mismatches are present, and the examples remain relevant for Spanish‑speaking audiences.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are retained. No significant information is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary material. The content remains faithful to the source.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. Readability and completeness are strong points, while fluency and terminology could be polished by using more idiomatic AI vocabulary (e.g., “ajuste fino”). Minor stylistic tweaks would bring the translation to a higher level of naturalness, but it is already quite usable for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 16/20, Fluency 15/20, Terminology 14/20, Contextual Adaptation 17/20, Information Completeness 18/20. Total: 80/100.\n\nRecommendations: replace “el afinado” with “el ajuste fino”, ensure consistent capitalization of technical terms, and consider splitting overly long sentences for better flow."
