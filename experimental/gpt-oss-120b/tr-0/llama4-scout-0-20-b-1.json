  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear order. Most sentences are easy to follow, and the complex concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, grounding, etc.) are explained with simple analogies that a non‑expert can understand. A few sentences are a bit long, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are a handful of slightly awkward expressions. For example, \"el ajuste\" is used for \"fine‑tuning\" – native speakers would more commonly say \"ajuste fino\" or \"afinamiento\". The phrase \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotage\" retains the French word *bachotage*, which feels out of place in Spanish. These minor issues prevent a perfect fluency score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely accurate: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"memoria a corto plazo\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"grounding (anclaje)\" are appropriate. The only inconsistency is the use of \"ajuste\" for fine‑tuning, which could be ambiguous, and the untranslated French term *bachotage*. Otherwise the terminology is consistent and suitable for the intended audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references well. The analogies (consultant vs specialist, studying for an exam vs mastering a subject) are preserved and make sense for Spanish‑speaking listeners. No cultural mis‑steps are evident, and the language is tailored to a podcast audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information present in the French script is retained in the Spanish version. No key points are omitted, and the supplemental explanations (e.g., about memory features) are fully preserved. Redundancy is minimal and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is very good overall. It conveys the technical content accurately and keeps the conversational tone of the podcast. Minor fluency and terminology issues—especially the untranslated French term *bachotage* and the generic use of \"ajuste\"—prevent it from being flawless, but they do not hinder understanding. With a few tweaks, the text would read as if originally written in Spanish.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17.8 ≈ 18/20."
