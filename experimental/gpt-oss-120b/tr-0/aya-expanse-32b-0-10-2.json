  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the analogies (e.g., graduate, consultant, bike riding) are preserved, making the technical ideas clear for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, but a few literal borrowings (e.g., “prompt”, “ventana de contexto” repeated) and slight stylistic oddities (“apuntador” for “cheat‑sheet”) prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, grounding). The only minor issue is the occasional retention of English jargon like “prompt”, which could be localized.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent, tone, and cultural references of the original podcast are faithfully reproduced. The examples are adapted well for a Spanish‑speaking audience, and no cultural mismatches appear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No information is lost or distorted, and the translation remains concise without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the original content clearly and accurately, with only minor lexical choices that feel a bit too literal. Technical terminology is largely appropriate, and the overall flow is smooth enough for a podcast audience. Minor refinements (e.g., fully localizing a few English terms) would bring it to near‑perfect level.\nOverall score (average): 18/20."
