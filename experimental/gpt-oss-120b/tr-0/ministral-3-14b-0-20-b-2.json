  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows naturally and the sentences are clear and well‑structured. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can follow. Minor hiccups (e.g., \"Y yo soy Luc\" instead of \"Yo soy Luc\") do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural to native Spanish speakers. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. A few small awkward spots appear, such as the mixture of Spanish and the original French podcast title in the opening and the inconsistent final title \"Tecno Relámpago\". The use of asterisks for *prompt* is acceptable but not typical in spoken podcast scripts. These issues are minor.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: pre‑entraînement → preentrenamiento, affinage → afinamiento, transfert → aprendizaje por transferencia, fenêtre de contexte → ventana de contexto, ICL kept as acronym, grounding → anclaje, etc. When necessary, brief explanations are kept, preserving the original meaning. The only slight inconsistency is the translation of the podcast name at the end, which does not affect the technical terminology.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation successfully conveys the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural references are adapted (e.g., using \"empollarse\" which is a common Spanish term for cramming). The only contextual mismatch is the change of the podcast title at the closing, which could confuse listeners familiar with the brand.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No essential detail is omitted, and the explanation of memory features, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the analogy with consultants is retained. Redundancy is minimal, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, accurately transmitting the technical content and pedagogical tone of the original French podcast. Minor inconsistencies—mainly the fluctuating podcast title and a few slightly stiff phrasing choices—prevent a perfect score, but they do not hinder understanding. Overall, the Spanish version is clear, fluent, and faithful to the source.\n\nScore summary:\n- Readability: 18/20\n- Fluency: 17/20\n- Terminology: 19/20\n- Contextual Adaptation: 18/20\n- Information Completeness: 19/20"
