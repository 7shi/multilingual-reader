    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the main ideas and the dialogue flows logically, so a native reader can follow the discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning. However, a few awkward constructions (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenido en\", \"cramar\", \"conocencias\") slightly impede smooth comprehension, especially for less‑technical listeners.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several non‑native‑like expressions and minor grammatical slips: \"bienvenido en\" instead of \"bienvenido a\", missing prepositions, the invented verb \"cramar\", misuse of \"conocencias\", spacing before punctuation marks, and inconsistent naming of the podcast at the end. These issues make the text feel translated rather than originally written in Spanish.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje\" are correctly rendered and consistently used. The word \"prompt\" is left untranslated, which is acceptable for a tech‑savvy audience. The only notable lapse is the misuse of \"cramar\" (intended to mean \"bachotear\"), which is not a recognized Spanish term.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French tone to a Spanish‑speaking podcast format, preserving the informal, conversational style. Cultural references are minimal, so the main challenge is linguistic naturalness, which is mostly achieved. The inconsistency in the podcast title (\"Tech Destello\" vs. \"Tech Éclair\" at the close) slightly harms the adaptation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the substantive content from the French script is present: the explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the notion of temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the description of the \"Memory\" feature. No major ideas are omitted, and the translation does not add irrelevant material.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation succeeds in delivering the technical content and maintains the structure of the original dialogue. The main weaknesses lie in linguistic naturalness and a few lexical errors that can confuse listeners (e.g., \"cramar\", \"conocencias\"). Consistency in naming the podcast should be fixed, and a few prepositional or punctuation issues corrected. With those adjustments, the translation would be fluent and fully natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience while preserving the technical accuracy of the original French script."
