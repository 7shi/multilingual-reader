  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear, step‑by‑step manner. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained with simple analogies that are easy to follow. Minor punctuation quirks (e.g., double “el”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., “Imaginen que se envía una IA…”, “una competencia permanente”) and a clear gender error (“las conocimientos”). These hiccups slightly break the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje/grounding, etc. The occasional use of “competencia” instead of “habilidad” is acceptable in the given context, and no term is left untranslated or misused.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French podcast tone to Spanish well, using familiar colloquial expressions (“¡Hola y bienvenidos!”, “¡Gracias por habernos escuchado!”). Cultural references are preserved, and the analogies remain effective for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor style issues (e.g., “el pre‑entrenamiento”) do not affect the overall adaptation.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the content from the original script is present: no sentences are omitted, no crucial detail is lost, and the structure of the dialogue is maintained. The translation even keeps the formatting of emphasized terms and parentheses.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical explanations clearly and retains the conversational tone of the podcast. Minor grammatical slips (notably the gender error \"las conocimientos\") and a few slightly stiff phrasings prevent it from being perfect, but they do not hinder understanding. The handling of technical terminology is excellent, and the adaptation to Spanish speakers is appropriate.\nOverall score: 18/20 (average of the individual criteria)."
