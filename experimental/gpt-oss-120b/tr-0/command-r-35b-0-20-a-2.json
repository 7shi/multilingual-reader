  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the dialogue in a clear and logical order. Most sentences are easy to follow and the technical concepts are explained with appropriate examples. Minor hiccups such as the phrase “cuando begins” slightly interrupt the flow, but they do not impede overall comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few constructions feel awkward or contain Anglicisms (“cuando begins”, “el modelo experto en inglés”). Some punctuation around parentheses could be smoother, and occasional literal translations (e.g., “el aprendizaje en contexto es como el ‘bachillerato’”) sound a bit forced. Nevertheless, a native speaker would understand it without difficulty.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “grounding (anclaje)”. The translation keeps English acronyms where appropriate and stays consistent throughout. Minor variations (e.g., “modelo experto en inglés” vs. “modelo experto en inglés”) do not affect clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the original intent, tone, and educational purpose of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral, and the language is suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in technology. The only noticeable lapse is the mixed English/Spanish phrase mentioned earlier, which slightly reduces the adaptation quality.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No essential information is omitted, and the examples (English‑French transfer, consultant analogy) are fully retained. Redundancies are minimal, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is strong: it faithfully transmits the technical content and pedagogical tone of the original podcast. Readability and terminology are particularly good, while fluency suffers from a few isolated awkward expressions and a minor code‑switching error. With a quick proofread to correct these small issues, the text would read as a fully natural Spanish script for a tech podcast.\n\n**Strengths**: accurate terminology, complete information, clear explanations, appropriate adaptation to the target audience.\n**Areas for improvement**: smooth out occasional literal translations and eliminate English‑Spanish mix‑ups to achieve a more native flow.\n\nScore summary: Readability 17/20, Fluency 15/20, Terminology 18/20, Contextual Adaptation 17/20, Information Completeness 20/20."
