  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally understandable and conveys the main ideas, but there are several grammatical slips and awkward phrasings (e.g., \"bienvenido en\", \"el afinado\", \"Apena aprende\", \"las conocimientos\"). These errors slightly hinder smooth comprehension, especially for listeners expecting a polished podcast script.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Native‑speaker‑like fluency is compromised by inconsistent use of terminology, colloquial or non‑standard words such as \"bachear\", and occasional typo‑like errors. The flow of dialogue feels stilted in places, though the overall meaning is clear.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved and correctly rendered (preentrenamiento, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding → anclaje). The translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"el afinado\" is acceptable but less common than \"ajuste fino\". Overall terminology handling is solid.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original podcast are retained, and cultural references (consultor, documentos) are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., \"es una trampa?\") feel a bit informal for a technical podcast, but they do not distort the message.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is omitted, and the examples (English → French transfer, memory feature) are kept intact. Minor typographical errors do not affect factual completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the full content and technical depth of the original French podcast, but it suffers from several linguistic inaccuracies and occasional unnatural phrasing that reduce readability and fluency. Technical terminology is handled well, and the overall message is preserved, making the translation functional but in need of careful proofreading and stylistic polishing for a professional podcast release.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
