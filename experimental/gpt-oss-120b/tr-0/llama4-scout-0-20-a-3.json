  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are mostly short and the dialogue flow mirrors the original. Complex ideas such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento and aprendizaje en contexto are explained with clear analogies, making the content accessible to a general audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for native speakers. Word order and verb tenses are appropriate, and colloquial expressions like “¡Una analogía perfecta!” feel idiomatic. A few minor hiccups (e.g., \"la IA no ha 'olvidado'\" with quotation marks) are barely noticeable.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste\" (instead of a literal \"fine‑tuning\"), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\". The translator kept the English acronyms and provided Spanish explanations, which is ideal for the target readership.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the podcast tone and cultural context. References to “consultor brillante” and “una ayuda” fit Spanish‑speaking listeners. The informal yet informative style is preserved, and no French‑specific idioms remain untranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original script are retained. No content is omitted, and the added parenthetical explanations (e.g., \"(Aprendizaje en contexto)\") enhance clarity without redundancy. The meaning of the “Memoria” feature is accurately conveyed.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical concepts accurately, reads smoothly, and adapts the conversational style to Spanish effectively. Minor stylistic tweaks could raise fluency to perfection, but the work is ready for publication in a Spanish‑language podcast.\n\nStrengths: consistent terminology, clear explanations, faithful preservation of intent. Areas for improvement: occasional over‑use of quotation marks and a slightly more varied sentence rhythm could enhance naturalness.\n\nScore out of 20: 18.5 (rounded to 18)."
