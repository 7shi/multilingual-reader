  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall understandable and follows the structure of the original podcast script. Most sentences convey the intended meaning, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can follow. However, there are several grammatical slips (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en…”, “rep aprender”, “partes de un contexto vacío”) and occasional awkward phrasing that force the reader to pause. These issues lower the smoothness of comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural expressions for native Spanish speakers. The mix of formal \"Usted\" with the informal podcast tone, the literal rendering of some idioms (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en…”, “Usted ha entendido todo”), and occasional lexical errors (\"rep aprender\", \"antiespia\") make the text sound stilted. While the meaning is preserved, the lack of idiomatic flow reduces fluency.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “grounding” → “anclaje”. The choice of \"afinamiento\" for \"fine‑tuning\" is acceptable, though \"ajuste fino\" is more common. Overall terminology is consistent and appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and explanatory style, but cultural adaptation is uneven. The use of \"Usted\" clashes with the casual, conversational tone of a podcast, and some literal translations miss opportunities for more natural Spanish equivalents. Nevertheless, the core message and examples remain clear.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All relevant information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the supplemental explanations (e.g., the analogy of a consultant) are kept. Minor redundancies appear but do not affect completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation succeeds in transmitting the full content of the original podcast and uses correct technical vocabulary. Its biggest shortcomings are grammatical inaccuracies, inconsistent register (mix of formal \"Usted\" with an informal podcast voice), and occasional literal phrasing that sounds unnatural to native speakers. A revision focused on idiomatic Spanish, consistent use of the informal \"tú\" register, and fixing the few grammatical errors would raise readability and fluency substantially. Overall, the translation is functional but needs polishing to reach a native‑level quality."
