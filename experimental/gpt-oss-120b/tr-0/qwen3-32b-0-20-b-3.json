  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are not overly long and the flow of ideas mirrors the original French script. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje y aprendizaje en contexto are explained with clear examples, making them accessible to a non‑expert audience. A few sentences are slightly clunky (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto es aprender de memoria”), but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a handful of awkward constructions and a notable terminology slip: “AIC” appears instead of the correct “ICL”. Some phrases (“una hoja de trucos justo antes de que comience a hablar con ustedes”) feel literal and could be smoother. Vocabulary is appropriate overall, yet the occasional stilted wording reduces the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, ventana de contexto, anclaje, etc. The decision to keep “prompt” unchanged is acceptable for a tech‑savvy audience. The inconsistency of using “AIC” instead of “ICL” is a minor error that could confuse readers. Overall, terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts cultural references suitably for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The analogies (consultant, cyclist) remain effective. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve resonance, but the core message and tone are well conveyed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant content has been omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The only slight deviation is the typo mentioned earlier, which does not affect factual completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical content clearly. Readability and completeness are strong points, while fluency suffers from a few awkward phrasings and a terminology slip (AIC vs ICL). With minor revisions to smooth out the language and correct the acronym, the text would reach a near‑native level of quality.\n\nStrengths: clear exposition of concepts, accurate technical vocabulary, faithful transmission of the original script.\nWeaknesses: occasional literal translations that feel stiff, and an incorrect acronym that could cause confusion.\n\nThe translation is ready for publication after a light editorial pass to polish the few rough edges.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16.8 → 17/20."
