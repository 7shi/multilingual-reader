  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are clear. Minor issues such as occasional long sentences and a few untranslated French words slightly affect flow, but overall a native reader can understand without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several literal renderings betray the source language (“el preentrenamiento”, “afinado”, “ancrage (grounding)”, “estratagema”). Some phrasing is a bit stiff (e.g., “Aprendizaje In‑Contexto”). These quirks make the text feel slightly robotic rather than conversational, which reduces fluency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and understandable: pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, ventana de contexto, afinado. However, the choice of “afinado” for fine‑tuning is uncommon in Spanish (normally “ajuste fino”), and the French term “ancrage” is left untranslated, breaking consistency. Still, the meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the original podcast’s informative and friendly tone, and the examples are adapted well for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only drawback is the occasional retention of French words, which may feel out‑of‑place culturally. Overall, the intent and style are well conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted or altered, and the logical flow of the discussion is intact. The translation even preserves the names of features like “Memoria”.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the full content of the original podcast with good clarity. It could be improved by using more idiomatic Spanish terminology (e.g., “ajuste fino” instead of “afinado”) and by eliminating the residual French words (“ancrage”). Addressing these minor lexical issues would raise fluency and terminology scores, bringing the overall quality closer to native‑level polish.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 84/100."
