    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the original dialogue structure. Most sentences are clear, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can follow. However, there are a few hiccups that affect smooth comprehension: the use of the non‑standard verb “bacchar” (a literal borrowing of the French “bachoter”) is confusing for Spanish‑speaking audiences, and the phrase “Eso sería incroyablement ineficaz” mixes French and Spanish, forcing the reader to pause.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally in most places, using conversational interjections like “¡Exacto!” and “¡Exactamente!”. Nonetheless, some constructions feel awkward (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto, es como bacchar para un examen”), and the stray French adverb “incroyablement” breaks the flow. These issues prevent the text from sounding completely native.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and “anclaje (grounding)” are all correctly rendered and consistently used. The only minor lapse is the informal “bacchar”, which is not a technical term but an inaccurate colloquialism.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal podcast tone and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., “consultor brillante”). The only notable misstep is the untranslated French word, which feels out of place for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Otherwise, the adaptation conveys the original intent effectively.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No sections are omitted, and the dialogue’s logical progression is intact. The stray French word does not remove content, so completeness remains high.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical content and conversational style of the original podcast. It succeeds in maintaining most of the nuance and detail, but occasional lexical slips (especially the mixed‑language phrase and the non‑standard “bacchar”) hinder readability and fluency. With a few edits to replace those artifacts with idiomatic Spanish, the text would be near‑perfect for native listeners.\n\n**Total score (out of 100): 82**\n\n**Strengths**: Accurate terminology, complete transfer of information, good preservation of tone.\n**Areas for improvement**: Eliminate French remnants, replace non‑standard colloquialisms with natural Spanish equivalents, and smooth out a few awkward sentence constructions."
