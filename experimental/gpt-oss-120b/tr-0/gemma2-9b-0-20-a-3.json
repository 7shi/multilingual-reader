    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the flow of ideas mirrors the original French script. Most sentences are clear, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can grasp. A few minor hiccups—such as the leftover French phrase “Voyez plutôt:” and the slightly awkward “las nuevas informaciones”—create brief pauses but do not hinder overall comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several non‑native constructions: “el afinamento” (should be *afinamiento*), “las nuevas informaciones” (unnatural plural), and the untranslated French interjection. These issues make the text feel a bit stilted for native speakers, though the majority of the vocabulary and grammar are appropriate.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *afinamiento (fine‑tuning)*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)*, *anclaje (grounding)*. Consistency is good, but the misspelling of “afinamiento” and the retained French “Voyez plutôt:” reduce precision. Overall, the terminology is suitable for the intended audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., “consultor brillante”). The occasional French phrase and a few literal translations slightly detract from a fully localized feel, yet the overall message and tone remain intact for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present; no sections are omitted or substantially altered. Minor redundancies appear (e.g., repeating “información”), but they do not affect the completeness of the content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the podcast script accurately and keeps the technical discussion understandable. While readability and completeness are strong, fluency suffers from a few lexical slips and an untranslated French fragment. Correcting these small errors would raise the overall quality to a near‑native level.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
