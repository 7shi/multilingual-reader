    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are clear. A few sentences are a bit long, but they do not impede comprehension. Minor punctuation issues (missing closing quotes) do not affect overall understandability.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and the style matches a podcast dialogue. Some expressions sound slightly forced or literal, e.g., “informaciones” instead of the more common “información”, and the mix of English words like *prompt* could be smoother. Nevertheless, a native speaker would find it fluid.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently handled: preentrenamiento, afinamiento (fine‑tuning), aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding → anclaje, etc. The occasional use of the English word *prompt* is acceptable in this context. The choice of “afinamiento” over the more literal “ajuste fino” is still understandable, showing good term management.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and keeps the informal, explanatory tone. Cultural adaptation is minimal but adequate. The only notable inconsistency is the podcast name: it stays “Tech Éclair” for most of the script but switches to the translated “Tecno Relámpago” at the very end, which could confuse listeners.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No major facts or analogies are omitted, and the explanatory examples are retained. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy, keeping the content concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content clearly, uses appropriate terminology, and remains readable and fairly natural for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Minor issues—such as a few slightly awkward phrasing choices, a small inconsistency in the podcast title, and occasional literal translations—prevent a perfect score, but they do not detract significantly from the listener’s understanding. The work demonstrates solid linguistic competence and a good grasp of the subject matter."
