  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the original dialogue structure. Most sentences convey the intended meaning, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can follow. However, there are several typographical and grammatical slips (e.g., \"¡Hola y bienvenido en\", \"posiblie\", \"Apena\", \"Las conocimientos\") that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural expressions and grammatical errors that would stand out to native speakers: \"¡Hola y bienvenido en\", \"El afinado... es allí donde interviene\", \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotage\", gender disagreement in \"Las conocimientos\", and the retention of French words like \"bachotage\". These issues make the text feel clunky and occasionally confusing.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" and \"grounding\" (rendered as \"anclaje\") are correctly rendered and consistent. The main drawback is the occasional use of French loanwords (\"bachotage\") and minor mismatches (\"Apena\" instead of \"apenas\"). Overall, terminology is adequate but not perfect.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. It adapts the dialogue to Spanish but sometimes uses overly formal \"Usted\" after a casual introduction, and some phrasing feels literal rather than idiomatic (e.g., \"¡Hola y bienvenido en\"). Nevertheless, the core message is conveyed effectively.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the logical flow of the conversation is retained. Minor redundancies or awkward phrasing do not cause loss of content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in transmitting the full content and technical explanations of the original podcast, but it suffers from several fluency and grammatical issues that make it sound unnatural to native Spanish speakers. Terminology is mostly accurate, though a few French terms slip through. With a careful proofreading pass to correct typographical errors, gender agreements, and awkward phrasing, the translation could reach a much higher quality level.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14.4/20."
