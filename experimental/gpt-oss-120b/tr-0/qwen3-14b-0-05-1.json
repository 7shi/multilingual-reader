  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow; sentences are generally clear and the logical flow of the podcast script is preserved. A few minor issues, such as the occasional French‑style term «pré‑entrenamiento» and slightly cumbersome phrasing, prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, but some expressions are literal translations (“el afinamiento”, “consultor brillante”) that a native speaker would phrase differently. Overall the language is smooth, with only occasional awkwardness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, anclaje, etc. Consistency is maintained, and the few choices (e.g., \"afinamiento\" vs. the more common \"ajuste fino\") are still understandable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original French podcast are well conveyed to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the metaphor of a temporary consultant vs. a permanent expert works well. Some French‑centric phrasing remains, slightly reducing the adaptation quality.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas, examples, and nuances from the original script are present. No substantive information is lost, and the translation does not add unnecessary material.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is faithful and comprehensible, preserving the educational tone of the podcast. Minor lexical choices and a few residual French‑style expressions keep it from being completely native‑like, but the content is accurate and clear for Spanish readers/listeners.\n\n**Strengths**: complete transfer of information, correct handling of technical terminology, clear exposition of concepts.\n**Areas for improvement**: replace less natural terms (e.g., \"el afinamiento\") with more common Spanish equivalents, fully localize all borrowed words, and smooth out a few literal constructions.\n\n**Overall score (average of the five criteria)**: 17/20."
