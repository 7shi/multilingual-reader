  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are clear, the flow mirrors the original dialogue, and complex ideas are explained with suitable examples. Minor typographic choices (e.g., “pre‑entrenamiento” vs. “preentrenamiento”) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural, but a few constructions feel slightly forced (“hoja de truco” for “cheat‑sheet”, “hablarte” instead of a more neutral verb). Vocabulary is appropriate and the dialogue rhythm is maintained.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento” (a valid Spanish rendering of fine‑tuning), “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL”. Only a more common alternative would be “ajuste fino”, but the chosen terms are still correct.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts idioms to Spanish (e.g., “consultor brillante”). Cultural references are neutral, making the content suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are retained. No significant information is omitted or added unnecessarily; the explanation of memory features and the distinction between ICL and fine‑tuning remains intact.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content clearly and maintains the conversational tone of the podcast. A few minor stylistic tweaks could improve naturalness, but the work is accurate and well‑adapted to Spanish listeners.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18/20."
