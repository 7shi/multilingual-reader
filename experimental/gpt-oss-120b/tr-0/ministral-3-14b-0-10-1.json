  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are clearly expressed. Sentences are generally short and the podcast‑style dialogue is easy to follow. Minor punctuation issues (e.g., missing period after \"preentrenamiento\") do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, but there are a few slightly awkward expressions such as \"informaciones específicas\" (normally \"información específica\"), \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\" and occasional over‑formal \"usted\" that feel less colloquial for a podcast. These do not break understanding but affect smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled very well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"grounding\" (anclaje) are all correctly rendered and kept consistent. The occasional plural of \"información\" is the only minor flaw.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original context appropriately. The podcast name is localized to \"Tecno Relámpago\", the tone remains conversational, and cultural references are preserved. Small issues such as the formal register could be softened, but the overall intent is fully conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue closely.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and faithful to the source, delivering the technical discussion in clear Spanish. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency could be polished slightly to sound more natural for a podcast audience. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for the intended listeners.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
