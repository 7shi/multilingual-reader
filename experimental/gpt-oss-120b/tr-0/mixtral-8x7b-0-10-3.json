  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured, the flow of ideas mirrors the original French script, and complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained in a straightforward manner. A few minor typographical choices (e.g., \"preentrenamiento\" vs. \"pre‑entrenamiento\") do not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are a few awkward passages: the English word *approach* is left unchanged (\"una nueva approach\"), the gender of \"IA\" is inconsistent (\"el IA\" instead of \"la IA\"), and \"preguntas y respuestas\" is a clumsy rendering of the French \"antisèche\"/\"cheat‑sheet\". These issues slightly break the flow for native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". The translation keeps the English acronym ICL and explains it, which is appropriate. The only slight weakness is the translation of \"cheat‑sheet\" as \"preguntas y respuestas\", which is less precise than a term like \"hoja de trucos\" or \"resumen\".",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational podcast tone is preserved (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenidos\", \"Gracias por habernos escuchado\"). Cultural references are neutral, so no loss of meaning. The few English remnants mentioned above are the only deviations from a fully adapted Spanish text.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No sentences are omitted or substantially altered, and the logical sequence of ideas remains intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does an excellent job of conveying the original content, keeping the educational and informal podcast style. Readability and completeness are strong, and the technical terminology is largely accurate. Fluency suffers from a handful of English insertions and gender mismatches, and the \"cheat‑sheet\" rendering could be improved. With minor polishing, the text would read as a fully natural Spanish podcast script.\n\nOverall rating: 18/20.\n\nThe translator shows solid command of both languages and the subject matter; attention to a few lexical choices would raise the fluency to near‑perfect level.\n\nScore: 18"
