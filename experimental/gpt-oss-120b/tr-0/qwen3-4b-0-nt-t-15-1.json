  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original dialogue structure, but there are several typographical and grammatical mistakes (e.g., \"conocencias\" instead of \"conocimientos\", \"Apena\" instead of \"apenas\", missing opening question marks, mixed use of \"tú\" and \"Usted\"). These errors disrupt the flow and may force the reader to pause, lowering overall readability.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most sentences are natural, the translation contains awkward phrasing, inconsistent registers, and untranslated French terms such as \"bachotage\". The mixture of formal and informal pronouns and occasional word‑order issues make the text feel less smooth for native speakers.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding, anclaje) are correctly rendered and consistently used. However, the retention of the French word \"bachotage\" and occasional misuse of \"conocencias\" weaken the precision of the terminology handling.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and maintains the educational tone of the podcast. Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience, and the analogies (consultor brillante, aprender a montar bicicleta) are well adapted. Minor register inconsistencies slightly detract from the adaptation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present; no major ideas are omitted. The translation stays faithful to the source content, and any added clarifications are minimal and do not introduce redundancy.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in transmitting the full content and technical depth of the original French podcast, but it is marred by typographical errors, inconsistent pronoun usage, and a few unnatural lexical choices. Correcting these issues—especially the misspellings, the mixed register, and the untranslated French term—would significantly improve readability and fluency while preserving the solid handling of terminology and completeness of information."
