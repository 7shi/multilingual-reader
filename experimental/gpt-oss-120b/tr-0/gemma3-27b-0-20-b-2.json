    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured, and complex ideas are explained in a way that a native reader can understand without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, with appropriate vocabulary and smooth phrasing. A few minor awkward constructions (e.g., “Es una memoria de un solo uso”) prevent a perfect score.",

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto” and the acronym ICL are correctly rendered and used consistently throughout.",

      "reasoning": "The translator has preserved the original intent, adapting idiomatic expressions (e.g., “consultor brillante”) to Spanish naturally and respecting cultural expectations of the target audience.",

      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical concepts accurately, reads smoothly for Spanish‑speaking listeners, and maintains the pedagogical tone of the original podcast. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but overall it is an excellent rendition of the source material.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.4/20, rounded to 18.5/20."
