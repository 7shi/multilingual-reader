  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are generally short and the flow of the conversation mirrors the original French podcast script. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in clear language. A few minor hiccups (e.g., \"Mira usted\" instead of a more natural \"Mira\") do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part and uses appropriate colloquial expressions for a podcast setting. There are occasional literal renderings that feel slightly stiff (e.g., \"Mira usted\", \"Esto se denomina aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\") and some redundant capitalisation, but overall the text flows smoothly and would be understood by native speakers without effort.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje\" are correctly translated and used consistently. The occasional English acronym (ICL) is retained with an appropriate Spanish explanation, which is helpful for the target audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original tone—informal, conversational, and explanatory—making it suitable for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the style matches a tech‑talk format. Minor formality in a few phrases (e.g., \"Mire usted\") could be softened, but the overall intent and purpose are fully preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas, examples, or analogies are omitted, and the supplemental explanations (e.g., the \"consultor temporal vs. experto permanente\" analogy) are retained. Redundancy is minimal and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, keeps the conversational tone of the podcast, and retains all essential information. Minor stylistic tweaks—especially reducing overly formal phrasing and smoothing a few literal translations—would bring the fluency up to a perfect level, but the current version is already clear, natural, and technically sound."
