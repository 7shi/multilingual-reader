  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to understand. Sentences are logical and the flow follows the original structure. Minor issues such as the uncommon word *ancraje* (instead of the more usual *anclaje* or keeping *grounding*) slightly hinder smooth comprehension, but the overall meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are noticeable anglicisms and awkward phrasing: *una nueva approach* should be *un nuevo enfoque*, and occasional clumsy constructions (*solo le hemos proporcionado un apunte justo antes de que comenzara a hablar con usted*). These do not break comprehension but reduce native‑speaker fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje de transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)* are appropriate. The only weak point is the translation of *grounding* as *ancraje*, which is not a standard term in Spanish AI literature.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original intent and adapts the examples to a Spanish‑speaking audience (e.g., using *consultor* and *experto*). Small cultural‑linguistic mismatches appear (*funciones de memorización* instead of *funciones de memoria*), but they do not alter the message.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is retained. No significant details are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary content. The core concepts, analogies, and examples are fully preserved.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and keeps the technical content intact. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency suffers from a few anglicisms and non‑standard word choices. The translation would benefit from polishing those expressions and using more common Spanish technical terms, but it is otherwise a solid rendition of the source material.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
