  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logical and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are clear. Minor issues such as the occasional mixed register (e.g., “Lo habéis entendido todo”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, but a few expressions sound awkward or contain grammatical slips: “Lo habéis entendido todo” (unusual phrasing), “una forma astucia” (should be “una forma astuta” or “ingeniosa”), and the mix of “vosotros” forms with a generally neutral tone. These reduce overall smoothness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is well‑handled. Terms like “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and “anclaje (grounding)” are correctly translated and used consistently. The word “prompt” is left in English, which is acceptable for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The informal podcast style is preserved, and cultural references are neutral. However, the use of the second‑person plural “habéis”, “vuestra” aligns with Peninsular Spanish and may feel odd for Latin‑American listeners. Aside from that, the adaptation conveys the original intent well.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the ideas, examples, and nuances from the original French script are present in the Spanish version. No important information is omitted, and no extraneous material is added.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is accurate and conveys the technical content effectively. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency suffers from a few awkward phrasings and a slight mismatch in register. The adaptation respects the original tone, though the choice of ‘vosotros’ forms may limit universality across Spanish‑speaking regions. Minor stylistic fixes would bring the translation to a very high level of naturalness.\n\nOverall rating (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
