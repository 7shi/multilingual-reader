  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clearly presented. However, there is a conspicuous garbled sentence – “Es decir, en otras palabras, esto es, o bien, o sea” – that does not convey any meaning and disrupts the flow. Apart from that, sentence structures are logical and the concepts remain understandable.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the wording sounds natural, but a few expressions are literal or awkward (e.g., “el pre‑entrenamiento”, “es del bachotaje”, “el aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje”). The odd filler line also breaks the natural rhythm. Overall the text is comprehensible, yet not fully native‑speaker smooth.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (In‑Context Learning)”, “grounding (anclaje)”. The terminology is consistent and appropriate for a technically‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original podcast tone to Spanish speakers, using familiar phrasing and keeping the explanatory style. Cultural references are minimal, and the intent is preserved, aside from the aforementioned nonsensical line which feels out of place.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. No substantive content is omitted, though the garbled sentence adds confusion without adding information.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in delivering the technical content and overall message of the podcast. It uses appropriate terminology and generally maintains a clear, engaging style. The main drawback is a nonsensical filler sentence and a few slightly stilted phrasings that affect readability and fluency. With minor edits to smooth out these spots, the translation would be of high quality.\nOverall score: 16/20 (average of the five criteria)."
