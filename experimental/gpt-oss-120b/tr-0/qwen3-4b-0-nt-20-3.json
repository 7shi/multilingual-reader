    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences are clear, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. However, there are a few typographical errors and awkward word choices (e.g., “bachear”, “las conocencias”) that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, but several expressions are unidiomatic or literal translations from French (e.g., “bachear para un examen”, “el afinado”, mixing English “fine‑tuning”). These create moments of awkwardness for a native Spanish speaker. Overall, the flow is acceptable but not fully native‑like.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), grounding → anclaje, etc. The only inconsistency is the occasional use of the English “fine‑tuning” instead of a Spanish equivalent (“ajuste fino”). Nevertheless, the terminology is accurate and consistent enough for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast style to Spanish (greetings, use of ¡ and ?, informal tone). Cultural references are maintained, and the core intent of the conversation is preserved. Minor issues like the colloquial “bachear” could be replaced by a more neutral term, but the overall adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the explanations remain intact despite minor lexical slips. The content is complete and faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast’s content accurately and is generally easy to understand. It succeeds in preserving the educational tone and technical depth. Minor lexical inaccuracies (e.g., “bachear”, “las conocencias”) and occasional English insertions prevent it from being perfectly natural, but these do not impede comprehension. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation with room for polishing to achieve native fluency throughout.\n\nOverall score (sum of the five criteria): 86/100."
