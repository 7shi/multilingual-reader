    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but there are several grammatical slips and awkward constructions (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenido en\", \"Se percibe a menudo estas IA\", \"Las conocencias\", repetition of \"anclaje\"). These issues slightly hinder smooth comprehension, especially for a non‑expert audience, but the overall message remains clear.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound literal or stilted, reflecting the French source rather than natural Spanish. Errors such as missing prepositions, agreement problems, and uncommon word choices (\"bacheo\", \"conocencias\") make the translation feel unnatural to native speakers. The flow is disrupted in several places.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly correctly rendered (preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje). The choice of \"anclaje\" for grounding is acceptable, and the core concepts are preserved. However, occasional misuse of words like \"conocencias\" instead of \"conocimientos\" shows a lack of precision.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original tone but occasionally fails to adapt idioms and cultural references (e.g., inconsistent use of \"Tech Flash\" vs. \"Tech Éclair\"). Some expressions remain overly literal, and the Spanish version does not fully optimize phrasing for the target audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French script are present; no substantial content is omitted. Minor phrasing differences do not lead to loss of meaning. The translation faithfully conveys the distinctions between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core content and technical concepts accurately, but it suffers from several linguistic shortcomings that affect readability and naturalness. Grammar errors, unnatural phrasing, and occasional terminology slips make the text feel somewhat mechanical. With careful editing to correct agreement, improve word choice, and ensure consistent branding, the translation could reach a high level of quality suitable for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14 out of 20.\n\nRecommendations: \n1. Fix grammatical errors (prepositions, gender/number agreement). \n2. Replace non‑standard words (\"conocencias\" → \"conocimientos\", \"bacheo\" → \"estudio de último momento\"). \n3. Ensure consistent naming of the podcast (choose either \"Tech Flash\" or keep \"Tech Éclair\"). \n4. Polish sentence structures for smoother flow.\n5. Review punctuation around quoted terms for Spanish typographic conventions.\n\nThese edits would raise both readability and fluency, bringing the overall quality closer to a professional translation level."
