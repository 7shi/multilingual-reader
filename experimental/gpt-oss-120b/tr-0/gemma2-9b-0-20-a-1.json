  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the main ideas and the dialogue flow is largely clear. Most sentences are understandable, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can follow. However, occasional grammatical slips (e.g., \"los palabras\", \"las nuevas conocimientos\") and a few unusually long sentences slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural but contains several awkward constructions and untranslated fragments (e.g., the French phrase \"Voyez plutôt:\" left unchanged, the Portuguese‑looking \"afinamento\"). These elements make the text feel less fluid to a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally well handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" are appropriate. The main inconsistency is the use of \"afinamento\" (a Portuguese form) instead of the standard Spanish \"afinamiento\" or \"ajuste fino\". Minor errors such as \"las nuevas conocimientos\" also affect precision.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of the podcast, and cultural references are unchanged, which is suitable. The leftover French expression and the occasional literal translation reduce the adaptation quality slightly.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the dialogue order is maintained. Minor redundancies are absent, and the content remains faithful to the source.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation does a good job of transmitting the technical content and the conversational style of the podcast. Readability and completeness are strong points, but fluency and terminology suffer from a few untranslated fragments, inconsistent word choices, and minor grammatical errors. With a careful revision of the problematic phrases and consistent use of Spanish technical vocabulary, the translation would reach a higher level of naturalness.\n\n**Total score:** 73 / 100"
