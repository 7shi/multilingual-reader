    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand and follows the original structure. Most sentences convey the intended meaning, and complex concepts are explained clearly. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en”, “las conocimientos”) and occasional overly long sentences slightly hinder smooth reading, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several unnatural expressions and minor errors that a native speaker would notice: “bienvenido en” instead of “bienvenido a”, “es del bacheo” for “es del bachotage”, “las conocimientos” (gender agreement), and the choice of “afinamiento” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”. These affect the natural flow, though the overall text remains intelligible.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well‑handled: “preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “ventana de contexto”, “grounding” → “anclaje”, etc. The translation keeps the specialized vocabulary consistent and appropriate for a technically‑savvy audience. The only slight drawback is the use of “afinamiento” rather than the more standard “ajuste fino”, but it is still understandable.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, adapting it for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Cultural references are neutral, and the educational style is maintained. However, a few phrases sound literal (“es del bacheo”) and could be rephrased for better cultural resonance, and the introductory greeting could be smoother.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the logical progression of the discussion is retained. Minor punctuation differences do not affect the content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning. It is clear and mostly accurate, but it suffers from occasional grammatical mistakes and unnatural phrasing that reduce fluency. A light editorial pass would bring the text to a higher level of naturalness without altering its technical integrity."
