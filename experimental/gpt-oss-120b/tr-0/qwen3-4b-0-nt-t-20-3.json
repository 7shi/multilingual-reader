  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure. Most sentences convey the intended meaning, but there are a few typographical errors (e.g., \"Apena\" instead of \"apenas\") and occasional misuse of formal pronouns (\"Usted\") that can slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound literal or awkward for native speakers: \"Usted ha entendido todo\", \"Es una analogía perfecta !\", missing opening question marks, and the mixture of formal/informal registers. These issues break the natural flow, although the overall message remains clear.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\" are appropriate. The choice of \"afinamiento\" for \"fine‑tuning\" is acceptable, and key English terms such as \"prompt\" are left unchanged, preserving technical accuracy.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone of a podcast conversation, but the occasional use of the formal \"Usted\" instead of the more fitting informal \"tú\" creates a slight mismatch with the casual style of the source. Minor cultural adjustments would improve the adaptation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No substantive ideas are lost; only minor typographical slips occur, which do not affect factual completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully transmits the core concepts about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning, preserving technical accuracy and completeness. However, fluency suffers from a few literal renderings, inconsistent register, and minor typographical errors. Improving the naturalness of the language (using informal pronouns, fixing punctuation and typos) would raise the overall quality.\n\nStrengths: correct technical terminology, complete conveyance of ideas. Weaknesses: occasional unnatural phrasing, mismatched formality, small typos that affect readability.\n\nOverall, it is a solid translation that needs polishing for native‑speaker fluidity.\n\nScore out of 100: 81/100 (average of the five criteria)."
