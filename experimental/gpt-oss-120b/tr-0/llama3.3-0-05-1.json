    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original script. Listeners can understand the concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning. A few minor hiccups (e.g., occasional missing opening question marks, inconsistent use of formal \"Usted\" vs. informal \"tú\") slightly affect smooth comprehension, but they do not prevent understanding.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally, but there are several spots that feel stiff or overly formal for a podcast tone (e.g., \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\", \"El modelo mismo no aprende ni evoluciona\"). Some sentences are slightly clunky, and the typo \"AIC\" instead of \"ICL\" breaks the flow. Overall, a native speaker would notice the odd register and occasional awkward phrasing.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"anclaje\" are appropriate. The only notable error is the accidental substitution of \"AIC\" for the original \"ICL\". Apart from that, terminology is consistent and accurate for a non‑expert audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and purpose, and the examples (consultant vs. specialist) are adapted correctly. However, the shift between formal and informal pronouns creates a slight mismatch with the likely casual podcast style. Cultural nuances (e.g., using \"¡Exactamente!\" and appropriate Spanish punctuation) are mostly respected, but the register inconsistency detracts a bit.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: the stages of training, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent knowledge distinction, and the explanation of the \"Memory\" feature. The only omission is the typo \"AIC\" which could cause confusion, but no substantive content is lost.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transferring the technical content and the overall narrative of the podcast. It is largely accurate and complete, with appropriate terminology for a general audience. The main weaknesses lie in register consistency (mixing formal and informal address) and a few linguistic slips (the \"AIC\" typo, occasional stiff phrasing). With minor polishing—especially aligning the tone to a conversational podcast style and fixing the acronym error—the translation would be excellent.\n\nOverall score: 84/100."
