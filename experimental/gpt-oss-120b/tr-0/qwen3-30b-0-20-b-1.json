  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured, and complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) are explained in plain language. Minor typographic issues such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\" (should be \"preentrenamiento\") do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but a few constructions feel literal or slightly awkward (e.g., \"el aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\" repeats the term, \"le proporcionamos\" vs. \"le\"). The register is appropriate for a podcast, yet some phrasing could be smoother.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". Consistency is maintained throughout, and English acronyms are kept with Spanish explanations.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal, conversational tone of the original and adapts cultural references (e.g., \"consultor brillante\"). The intent and purpose are conveyed accurately, with only minimal loss of naturalness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is retained. No sentences are omitted, and the logical flow of the discussion is preserved. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality, faithfully transmitting the technical content and the lively podcast style. Minor issues with hyphenation, occasional literal phrasing, and a few awkward constructions keep it just shy of perfection, but the overall result is clear, accurate, and well‑adapted to Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18.2 / 20, rounded to 18 / 20."
