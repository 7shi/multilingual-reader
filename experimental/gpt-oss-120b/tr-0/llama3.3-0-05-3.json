  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is easy to follow for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the pedagogical analogies (consultor temporal vs. experto permanente, estudiar para un examen) are preserved. Minor issues such as occasional formal \"Usted\" in a conversational podcast slightly affect flow, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural in most places, but a few expressions feel stiff or slightly mistranslated. Examples: \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\" (more natural would be \"Lo has entendido todo\"), and the acronym \"AIC\" appears instead of the correct \"ICL\". These small slips prevent a fully native‑like reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding → anclaje, etc. The only notable inconsistency is the substitution of ICL with \"AIC\", which could confuse readers familiar with the English acronym.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The mix of formal and informal pronouns is the only slight mismatch with the original informal podcast tone.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the description of “memoria” features. No major content is omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is very good. It conveys the technical concepts clearly and retains the educational spirit of the original podcast. Minor fluency hiccups (formal pronouns, an occasional wrong acronym) and a few slightly unnatural phrasing choices keep it from being perfect, but the text remains comprehensible and faithful to the source.\n\nStrengths: accurate terminology, complete information transfer, clear explanations. \nAreas for improvement: ensure consistent register (prefer \"tú\" for a podcast), double‑check acronyms, and smooth a few literal renderings to sound more natural.\n\nScore out of 100 (sum of the five criteria): 87/100."
