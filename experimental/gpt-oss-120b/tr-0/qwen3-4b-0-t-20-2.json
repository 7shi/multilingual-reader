    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the structure of the original dialogue. Most sentences convey the ideas clearly, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can follow. However, there are several awkward phrasings (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en”, “se envían una nueva IA”, “antiesencia”) and occasional missing accents that slightly impede smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains multiple non‑native constructions and lexical choices that feel forced or incorrect. Examples include the misuse of “aplasteamiento” for “cramming”, the literal “antiesencia” for “antisèche”, and agreement errors such as “se envían una nueva IA”. These issues make the text sound stilted rather than natural.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely handled well: “preentrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL”, and the notion of “memoria” are correctly rendered. The term “grounding” is translated as “anclaje”, which is acceptable, and the French‑style parentheses are kept consistently. No major term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and explanatory tone. Cultural adaptation is minimal but adequate for a francophone‑to‑Spanish audience. Nevertheless, some literal translations (e.g., “aplasteamiento”) and the unnatural opening greeting reduce the adaptation quality.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original script are present; no substantial information is omitted. Minor lexical inaccuracies do not lead to loss of meaning, and the overall content remains faithful to the source.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full content and technical ideas of the original French podcast fairly accurately, but it suffers from several fluency and readability issues that make it feel less natural to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Terminology is well‑handled, and no important information is lost, yet the occasional awkward wording and a few mistranslations detract from an otherwise solid effort.\nOverall rating: 15/20.\nRecommendations: revise the opening greeting, correct agreement and lexical errors, replace non‑standard words like “aplasteamiento” and “antiesencia” with more common equivalents (“memorización intensiva”, “chuleta”), and polish punctuation and accentuation throughout.\n\nScore out of 20: 15"
