    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are clearly expressed. Most sentences are easy to follow, and complex concepts are explained in a straightforward way. A few long sentences could be split, and the word “afinado” is slightly less common than “afinación”, but overall comprehension is excellent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic, though there are occasional awkward constructions (e.g., “El afinado…”, “El modelo mismo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de vuestras conversaciones”). These do not impede understanding but prevent it from being completely native‑like.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, ventana de contexto, etc. The occasional retention of the English term in parentheses is helpful. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The podcast tone is preserved, and cultural references are adapted (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenidos!”, “consultor brillante”). The translation respects the target audience’s expectations and keeps the informal, explanatory style.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the original information is present; no significant ideas are omitted or altered. The translation even keeps the parenthetical explanations and examples, maintaining the full content while staying concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the original message accurately, uses appropriate technical language, and retains the conversational podcast style. Minor lexical choices and a few slightly clunky phrases keep it from being perfect, but they do not affect the overall effectiveness.\nScore out of 20: 18"
