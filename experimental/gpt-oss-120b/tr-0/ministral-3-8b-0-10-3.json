  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are kept simple enough for a general audience. Only a few very long sentences slightly reduce fluidity, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for native speakers. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary; technical borrowings such as “prompt” and “ICL” are kept in English, which is common in Spanish tech discourse. Minor awkwardness appears in phrases like “expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo” and occasional redundancy, but overall the text sounds smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "All key technical terms are correctly rendered (preentrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, grounding). The translator consistently uses the same Spanish equivalents and provides the original English in parentheses where useful, which helps comprehension without causing confusion.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French idioms and cultural references to Spanish effectively. The tone stays conversational and the examples (consultor brillante, aprender a andar en bicicleta) are culturally neutral and appropriate. No French‑specific expressions are left untranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No relevant information is omitted. All arguments, analogies, and nuances present in the French script are retained in the Spanish version. The translation does not add unnecessary content nor repeat ideas excessively.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the original podcast’s lively tone, and is readily understandable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but they do not detract from the effectiveness of the translation.\n\nStrengths: precise handling of technical terminology, clear explanations, faithful preservation of the original structure and intent.\nWeaknesses: occasional slightly clunky phrasing and very long sentences that could be broken up for smoother reading.\nThe translation would serve well for a tech‑savvy audience and for a general podcast listener alike.\n\nScore (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
