  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation flows naturally and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Sentences are generally clear, and complex concepts such as transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in understandable terms. A few minor hiccups (e.g., “una cantidad mucho menor de texto en francés”) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the Spanish sounds natural and would be comfortable for native listeners. Some terminology choices are literal translations that are less common in the Spanish AI community (e.g., “afinamiento” instead of “ajuste fino” or “fine‑tuning”, “consultor temporal” instead of “consultor puntual”). These slight oddities keep the fluency from being perfect.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding → anclaje, etc. Consistency could be improved (pre‑entrenamiento vs preentrenamiento) and a few terms could use the more established Spanish jargon, but the meaning is accurate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The podcast tone is kept, cultural references are appropriate, and the translation respects the original intent. Minor literal renderings (e.g., “consultor temporal”) could be refined, yet they do not affect the overall message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines and explanatory details from the French source are present. No information is lost or added unnecessarily; the translation is faithful and concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version is a solid, faithful rendering of the French podcast script. It is easy to understand, captures the technical depth, and maintains the conversational style. Small issues with terminology choice and occasional literal phrasing keep it from being completely native‑like, but these do not detract significantly from the overall quality.\n\nStrengths: clear exposition of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning; consistent structure; retains the educational tone. \nAreas for improvement: adopt more common Spanish AI jargon (e.g., “ajuste fino” instead of “afinamiento”), ensure term consistency, and polish a few slightly awkward sentences.\n\nOverall, the translation is very good and only needs minor polishing to reach native‑level fluency.\n\nScore (average of the five criteria): 17.8 → rounded to 18/20.)"
