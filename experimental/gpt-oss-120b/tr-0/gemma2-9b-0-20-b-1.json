  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and conveys the concepts clearly. Sentences are generally well‑structured, and the dialogue format is preserved. Minor issues such as occasional overly long sentences do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few literal renderings feel awkward to a native speaker (e.g., keeping the French word *ancrage*, using *Aprendizaje In‑Contexto* instead of the more common *aprendizaje en contexto*). Overall the flow is smooth, but these hiccups prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely well‑handled: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto* are appropriate. However, inconsistencies appear with *aprendizaje In‑Contexto* vs *aprendizaje en contexto* and the untranslated French term *ancrage*. These reduce the score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the Spanish‑speaking audience, using familiar expressions (e.g., *consultor brillante*) and preserving the podcast’s informal tone. Cultural references are adapted adequately, and the original title is left unchanged, which is appropriate for a brand name.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No content is omitted, and the dialogue’s structure is fully retained. The only minor point is the untranslated brand name, which is intentional rather than a loss.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It delivers the full technical content in a clear and engaging way, with only a few minor lexical and stylistic slips. Terminology is mostly accurate, though consistency could be improved. Overall, the text is readable, faithful to the source, and appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience.\n\nScore (average): 17/20.\n\nRecommendations: replace the French *ancrage* with *anclaje* or *enraizamiento*, use *aprendizaje en contexto* uniformly, and avoid mixed‑language parentheses unless necessary for branding.\n\nOverall rating: 17/20."
