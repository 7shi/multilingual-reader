    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and follows a logical flow that mirrors the original French script. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can grasp. A few sentences are slightly literal (e.g., \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje\"), but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural to a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and the conversational tone of a podcast is preserved. Some phrasing is a bit awkward or overly literal (e.g., \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\", \"el modelo en sí no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus discusiones\"). These minor issues prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\" and \"anclaje\" are correctly used. Keeping the English acronym ICL is acceptable. The choice of \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\" is reasonable, though some readers might prefer \"enraizamiento\". Overall, terminology is accurate and coherent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French podcast style to Spanish, preserving the informal, explanatory tone. Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is required. The only slight mismatch is the use of \"bachotaje\", a term less common in some Spanish varieties, but it conveys the intended meaning. The intent and purpose are fully retained.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the source script is present in the translation. No sentences or concepts have been omitted, and no extraneous content has been added. The translation remains faithful to the original length and structure.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is a high‑quality rendering of the original French podcast script into Spanish. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational tone, and includes all relevant information. Minor stylistic and lexical issues (some literal constructions and a few less‑common terms) prevent it from being completely natural, but these do not significantly affect understanding. Overall, it is a solid, professional translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
