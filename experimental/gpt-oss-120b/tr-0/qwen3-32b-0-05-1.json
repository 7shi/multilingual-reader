  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the analogies (e.g., \"como un consultor brillante\" or \"como aprender a andar en bicicleta\") are clear. Minor punctuation quirks (extra spaces before « ») do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, but there are a few awkward constructions: \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es un bachotaje\" (unnecessary comma), \"la IA no ha « olvidado »\" (spacing around the quotes), and the use of the unexplained abbreviation \"AIC\" instead of the standard \"ICL\". These issues slightly break the flow for a native speaker.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\", etc. The only lapse is the inconsistent abbreviation \"AIC\" for In‑Context Learning, which could confuse readers familiar with the usual ICL acronym.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts cultural references well (e.g., using \"bachotaje\" for cramming). The tone remains conversational and appropriate for a podcast audience. Minor stylistic choices (quotes, hyphenation) are acceptable but could be refined.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present; no ideas are omitted or altered. The only deviation is the abbreviation change mentioned above, which does not affect the factual content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version conveys the original podcast script accurately and clearly. It handles technical jargon competently and keeps the conversational style, making the material accessible to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Small grammatical slips and the inconsistent abbreviation prevent a perfect score, but they do not materially affect understanding.\nOverall, the translation is strong and would be well‑received by the target audience.\nScore: 18/20"
