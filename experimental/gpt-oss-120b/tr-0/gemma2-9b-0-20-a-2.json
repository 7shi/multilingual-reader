  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and follows a logical flow. Most sentences are easy to understand, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in a comprehensible way. Minor hiccups (e.g., occasional French phrase left in) slightly disrupt the smoothness, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly natural, but there are a few awkward constructions that a native speaker would avoid. Examples: the French interjection \"Voyez plutôt:\" left unchanged, the use of \"afinamento\" instead of the more common Spanish \"ajuste fino\" or \"afinación\", and occasional literal renderings like \"la gran pregunta\" that feel a bit stiff. These issues lower the overall fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally well‑handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"grounding\" are correctly translated. The main drawback is the inconsistent rendering of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"afinamento\", which is not standard Spanish terminology and may confuse readers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the podcast tone and adapts cultural references appropriately. However, the residual French phrase and a few literal translations (e.g., \"una antisèche\" rendered as \"una pista\") show that the adaptation is not fully polished.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the essential explanations are retained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation conveys the original content accurately and is understandable to Spanish‑speaking listeners. It would benefit from a final proofreading pass to remove leftover French fragments and replace non‑standard terms like \"afinamento\" with more idiomatic Spanish equivalents. After those tweaks, the text would be both fluent and fully natural for the target audience."
