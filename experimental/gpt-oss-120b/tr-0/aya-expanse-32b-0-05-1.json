  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow; sentences are logically ordered and the podcast‑style dialogue is preserved. Minor issues such as the parenthetical expansion of ICL slightly distract, but overall a Spanish reader can understand the concepts without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, using appropriate colloquial expressions (“¡Gracias por escucharnos!”, “da la impresión”). Some phrasing is a bit awkward, especially the expansion “el ICL (Lenguaje de Comprensión e Generación)”, which sounds forced and unidiomatic. Overall fluency is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding) are correctly rendered and consistent. The only notable inaccuracy is the translation of the abbreviation ICL as “Lenguaje de Comprensión e Generación”, which does not correspond to the established term “In‑Context Learning”. This could cause confusion for a technically‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the informal podcast tone and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., “¡Gracias por escucharnos!”). The style fits a Spanish‑speaking audience. Apart from the ICL terminology issue, the adaptation is spot‑on.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue and explanatory content from the original French is present; no substantive information is lost. The translation is faithful to the source, with only minor re‑phrasings that do not affect meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is very good. It conveys the technical content clearly, maintains the lively podcast voice, and is largely natural for Spanish readers. The main weakness lies in the inaccurate rendering of the abbreviation ICL, which slightly harms terminology consistency. Apart from that, readability, completeness and cultural adaptation are strong, making the text suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nThe translation would reach a higher level of polish by keeping the original abbreviation ICL (or translating it as ‘aprendizaje en contexto’) and by smoothing the few slightly stilted sentences.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 86 / 100, which corresponds to 17 / 20 on a 20‑point scale."
