  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and follows a logical flow, allowing readers to grasp the concepts without major difficulty. A few sentences are long and some phrasing (e.g., \"ventana de contexto\" and the redundancy in \"Aprendizaje en Contexto In-Context\") could be smoother, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural, but there are noticeable unnatural expressions such as \"la IA no se está afilando\" (should be \"afinando\"), mixed gender agreement, and the clunky abbreviation explanation. These minor grammatical slips prevent full fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well‑handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje de transferencia\", \"ajuste fino\", \"ICL\". However, inconsistency appears with \"afilando\" instead of \"afinando\" and a slightly awkward rendering of the ICL abbreviation, which slightly harms consistency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts the examples (consultor brillante, antisèche) appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral and fitting, with only minor stylistic oddities.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted, and the supplemental explanations remain faithful to the source.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and maintains most of its technical depth. While readability and terminology are strong, fluency suffers from a few grammatical missteps and inconsistent use of certain terms. Overall, it is a solid translation that would be easily understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience, needing only minor polishing for native‑like smoothness.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16.6 ≈ 17/20."
