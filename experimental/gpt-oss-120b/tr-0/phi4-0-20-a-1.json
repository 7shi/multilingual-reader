  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the flow of the conversation mirrors the original French script, making the technical discussion accessible to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but a few expressions feel awkward (e.g., \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje\", \"hoja de trucos\" and extra spaces around punctuation). These minor issues prevent a fully native‑like fluency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\" are correctly rendered. The only notable lapse is keeping the French word \"ancrage\" instead of translating it to \"anclaje\" or \"fundamentación\", which could confuse readers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and cultural relevance. The analogy of a consultant and the use of \"hoja de trucos\" fit well in Spanish. Apart from the untranslated \"ancrage\", the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas, examples, and nuances from the French script are retained. No significant information is omitted or altered, and the supplementary explanations remain intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and reads well for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor fluency hiccups and the untranslated French term \"ancrage\" are the main drawbacks, but they do not substantially impede comprehension. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation with only small areas for refinement.\n\nScore: 18/20 (average of the five criteria)."
