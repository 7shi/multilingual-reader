  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow; sentences are generally well‑structured and the flow of ideas mirrors the original. Minor hiccups such as the use of «miren mejor» or occasional long clauses do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly naturally, but a few expressions sound forced or unidiomatic (e.g., «la afinación», «miren mejor», «monta en silla»). Vocabulary is appropriate, yet some phrasing could be smoother for native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly rendered (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding). The choice of «afinación» for fine‑tuning is acceptable but less common than «ajuste fino», and the term «prompt» is omitted where it could have been kept for precision.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone, adapting cultural references appropriately. Small oddities (e.g., «miren mejor», «monta en silla») slightly reduce the natural fit, but the overall message remains intact.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines and technical explanations from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is lost or added, and the structure mirrors the original precisely.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and complete, successfully transmitting the technical content and conversational style of the podcast. It would benefit from minor stylistic polishing—especially replacing a few literal translations with more idiomatic Spanish and using the more common term «ajuste fino»—to achieve a fully native feel. Overall, it is a solid and reliable translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 17/20.\n\nScore: 17"
