  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the original structure. Most sentences convey the ideas clearly, and the use of exclamation marks gives a natural podcast feel. However, some sentences are long and a bit clunky, and occasional punctuation choices (e.g., missing commas) make the flow less smooth.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several noticeable unnatural expressions and typographical errors: \"Ved\" instead of \"Ver\", \"trasmitiendo\" (missing s), the English word \"fundamentally\" left untranslated, and the phrase \"¡Entiende todo.\" which sounds odd in Spanish. These errors break the native‑speaker feel, even though the majority of the translation is correct.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally well‑handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\" (though rendered as \"el afinar\"), \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"grounding\" (kept as \"anclaje (grounding)\") and \"Memoria\". Consistency is good, and the translator kept English terms like \"prompt\" where appropriate. Minor inconsistency with \"afinar\" vs the more common \"afinamiento\".",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original tone, uses Spanish punctuation, and adapts the style to a conversational podcast format. Cultural references are neutral and the intent is fully conveyed. Small lexical choices could be smoother, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No sections are omitted, and the examples (English‑French transfer, memory tricks) are retained. The translator does not add unnecessary information, keeping the content concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content and the lively podcast atmosphere. Readability and terminology are strong, and the essential information is intact. However, fluency suffers from a few glaring typographical and lexical errors that prevent it from feeling fully natural to native Spanish speakers. A light revision to fix those errors would raise the quality substantially.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16 out of 20.\n\n**Strengths**: accurate terminology, complete coverage of the source material, good adaptation to the podcast style.\n**Weaknesses**: occasional mistranslations/typos and some awkward phrasing that hurt naturalness.\n**Recommendation**: proofread for typos, replace \"Ved\" with \"Ver\", correct \"trasmitiendo\" to \"transmitiendo\", translate the stray English word \"fundamentally\", and use more idiomatic phrasing such as \"¡Lo has entendido todo!\" or \"¡Entiendes todo!\". After these fixes the translation would reach a high‑intermediate to advanced level of fluency.\n\nScore: 16/20"
