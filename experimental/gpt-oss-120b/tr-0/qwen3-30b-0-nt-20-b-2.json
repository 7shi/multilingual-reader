  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas are conveyed in a logical order. Most sentences are easy to follow, and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained with suitable examples. Minor punctuation issues (e.g., missing commas, inconsistent use of «» versus \"\") and occasional slightly abrupt transitions prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, but a few expressions sound a bit forced or literal. \"El afinamiento\" is understandable but less idiomatic than \"ajuste fino\"; \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es como estudiar para un examen!\" lacks proper punctuation and the exclamation mark placement is odd. Overall, a native speaker would understand everything, but the flow could be smoother.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely preserved and correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ventana de contexto, ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto), anclaje, etc. The choice of \"afinamiento\" for \"fine‑tuning\" is acceptable, though \"ajuste fino\" would be more common in Spanish technical literature. Consistency is maintained throughout the dialogue.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts the discourse to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Cultural references are neutral, and the metaphor of a consultant is kept, which works well in Spanish. Minor stylistic tweaks (e.g., using \"consultor brillante\" instead of a literal translation) could improve the adaptation, but the overall purpose is conveyed accurately.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and the technical explanations are fully retained. The only differences are typographic (quotes, punctuation) that do not affect content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and faithfully conveys the original podcast script. Readability and completeness are strong, and the technical concepts are well handled. Fluency and terminology could be polished slightly (more idiomatic wording, consistent use of standard technical terms) to reach a near‑native level, but the current version is already very functional for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17.2 → 17/20.\nOverall rating: 17/20."
