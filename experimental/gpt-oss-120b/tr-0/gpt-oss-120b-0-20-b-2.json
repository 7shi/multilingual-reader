  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the sentences are easy to follow. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained clearly, preserving the pedagogical tone of the podcast.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for native speakers. Minor awkwardness appears in a few repetitions (e.g., \"aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (aprendizaje en contexto)\") and the informal use of \"chuleta\", but overall the language is smooth and conversational.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\". The occasional English term is retained in parentheses, which aids comprehension.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately. The informal podcast voice is maintained, though a few expressions could be slightly refined for a broader audience (e.g., \"consultor brillante\" vs. \"consultor de alto nivel\").",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present; no ideas are omitted or distorted. The supplemental explanations (e.g., the analogy of \"bachotage\") are preserved.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains readability and fluency, and stays faithful to the original podcast style. Minor repetitions and informal slang prevent a perfect score, but the work is clear, complete, and well‑adapted to Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\nScore breakdown:\n- Readability: 18/20\n- Fluency: 17/20\n- Terminology: 19/20\n- Contextual adaptation: 16/20\n- Information completeness: 20/20\n\nThe average yields an overall score of 18/20, reflecting a strong translation with only small room for improvement.\n\nReasoning: The scores were assigned after a systematic review of each evaluation criterion, considering how well the translation meets the expectations of native‑speaker comprehension, natural expression, accurate technical rendering, cultural suitability, and faithful transmission of all source information. Minor stylistic issues slightly lowered fluency and contextual adaptation, while the other criteria were near‑perfect.\n\nScore: 18"
