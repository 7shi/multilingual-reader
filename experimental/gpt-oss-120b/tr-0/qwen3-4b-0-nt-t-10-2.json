    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally understandable and the main ideas are conveyed, but several sentences are clumsy or contain grammatical errors that hinder smooth reading (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en «Tech Éclair»”, “Cuando usted afinan un modelo”). Some literal translations (“antiespuma”) are confusing for Spanish speakers. Overall the text can be followed, but the flow is disrupted in places.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are multiple unnatural constructions and lexical choices that make the text sound non‑native: use of \"bienvenido en\" instead of \"bienvenido a\", inconsistent gender agreement, the odd term \"antiespuma\", and occasional English remnants (\"Simply\"). These issues lower the naturalness despite the correct technical content.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly translated correctly (preentrenamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto). However, \"fine‑tuning\" is rendered inconsistently as \"afinado\" and \"afinamiento\", and the French \"antisèche\" is mistranslated as \"antiespuma\", which is not a recognized Spanish term. The terminology is therefore partially appropriate but contains noticeable errors.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone of a podcast conversation, but cultural and linguistic adjustments are missing (e.g., the greeting, idiomatic expressions). Some phrasing is literal and feels forced, reducing the natural adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of \"memory\" features. No significant information is omitted, and the logical order is preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in transmitting the full content of the original French podcast and retains the technical explanations. Nevertheless, it suffers from several fluency and readability problems, inconsistent terminology, and a few mistranslations that make it feel non‑native. A revision focusing on natural Spanish phrasing, consistent use of technical terms (e.g., \"ajuste fino\" for fine‑tuning), and correcting erroneous words like \"antiespuma\" would markedly improve the quality.\nOverall score (average): 14/20."
