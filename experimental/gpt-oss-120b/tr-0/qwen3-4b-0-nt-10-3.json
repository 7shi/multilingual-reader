    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text conveys the original ideas clearly and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. Most sentences are understandable, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can follow. Minor typographical issues (missing spaces, occasional punctuation quirks) slightly affect smooth reading, but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several awkward or ungrammatical passages: “cuando usted afinan un modelo” (should be “afina”), the use of “antiespia” for the French “antisèche”, and occasional literal translations (“bachear” for “cram”) that sound odd to native speakers. These mistakes break the natural rhythm of the dialogue, even though the majority of the translation sounds fluent.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto” and “aprendizaje por transferencia” are correctly rendered. However, the mistranslation of “antisèche” as “antiespia” is a clear error, and the informal “bachear” may not be the best choice for a podcast script. Consistency is otherwise good.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original tone and intent well, preserving the conversational style of a podcast. Cultural references are appropriate, and the explanations are kept accessible. Some phrasing could be refined to better match Spanish‑speaking audiences (e.g., using “chuleta” instead of “antiespia”), but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue closely.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the original podcast’s content and structure, making the technical discussion accessible to Spanish listeners. Nevertheless, a few grammatical slips and an inaccurate translation of a key term prevent it from reaching a fully native‑speaker level. A careful proofreading pass and replacement of the erroneous “antiespia” with a proper equivalent would raise the quality substantially.\nOverall, the work is good but not flawless, earning an average rating around 16/20.\n\nScore out of 20 points: 16"
