  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand. Sentences follow a logical order and the concepts are explained clearly. However, there are a few typographical errors (e.g., \"informaciónes\" and \"informaciónes\") and occasional literal translations that slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are some awkward constructions (e.g., \"presentarle una cantidad mucho menor de texto\", \"Usted ha entendido todo\", mixed formal‑informal address) and the repeated typo \"informaciónes\". The English loan‑word \"prompt\" is left unchanged, which is acceptable for a technical audience but slightly reduces fluency for a general listener.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje, etc. The term \"prompt\" is kept in English, which is common in the field, and the translation stays consistent throughout. Minor improvement could be a short parenthetical explanation of \"prompt\" for less‑technical listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original podcast tone is preserved; the translation uses appropriate Spanish salutations and maintains the explanatory style. Some small issues appear with the mix of \"tú\" and \"usted\", but they do not change the intent. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is adequate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the examples are retained. The only loss is the minor typographical errors, which do not affect factual completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. Readability and terminology are strong points, while fluency is slightly marred by a few typographical mistakes and occasional unnatural phrasing. With a quick proofread to fix the \"informaciónes\" typo and smooth out a couple of literal constructions, the text would be near‑perfect for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience.\n\n**Overall score (average of the five criteria):** 17/20"
