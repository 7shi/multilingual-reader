    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas without excessive complexity, and the dialogue format remains intact. Minor long sentences could be split, but overall comprehension is excellent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for native speakers. Vocabulary is appropriate and most idiomatic expressions are well‑chosen. A few phrases are slightly literal (e.g., “justo antes de que comience a hablar contigo”), but they do not hinder fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: pre‑training → preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning → afinamiento, transfer learning → aprendizaje por transferencia, in‑context learning → aprendizaje en contexto, grounding → anclaje, etc. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using familiar phrasing and culturally neutral examples. The intent and tone of the original podcast are preserved.",
      "score": 18

    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is present. No key details are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It faithfully conveys the technical concepts while remaining readable and natural for Spanish listeners. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve flow, but the work is solid and technically accurate.\nThe average score across criteria is 18.4, which translates to an overall rating of 18/20."
