  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the complex ideas about pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑specialist can understand. A few sentences are slightly long, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic, e.g., \"cajas negras\", \"consultor brillante\". Minor awkwardness appears with the handling of some English‑derived terms (\"El afinado\", \"el preentrenamiento\") and punctuation around questions, but these do not break the flow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are all rendered accurately and consistently. The occasional retention of English terms in parentheses (fine‑tuning, ICL) is helpful for readers familiar with the field.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references suitably for Spanish‑speaking audiences. French idioms such as \"boîte noire\" become \"cajas negras\" and the consulting analogy is preserved. The tone remains conversational and podcast‑like, matching the source.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present. No key points are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The explanations of memory vs. permanent skill, and the description of “memory” features, are fully retained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains readable and largely natural, and respects the original style and purpose. Minor fluency tweaks (e.g., adjusting phrasing of \"El afinado\" and punctuation) would bring it even closer to native‑speaker standards, but the current version is very solid for a podcast transcript aimed at a general audience interested in AI.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
