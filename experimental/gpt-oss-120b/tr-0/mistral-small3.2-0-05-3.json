  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained clearly. Minor punctuation issues (missing closing question mark) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few expressions are slightly awkward for native speakers: “Vea:” after “El aprendizaje por transferencia es la clave” and the literal rendering of some French‑style constructions. Overall the flow is good, yet a bit more idiomatic phrasing would improve it.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento (fine‑tuning), transferencia de aprendizaje, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje (grounding). The choices are appropriate for a tech‑savvy audience. Only a possible alternative would be “ajuste fino” instead of “afinamiento”, but the current term is understandable.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural references are neutral, and the speaker‑style remains engaging for Spanish listeners. Small stylistic tweaks could make it feel more native, but the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the key distinctions between fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are retained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and keeps the conversational tone of the podcast. Readability and completeness are excellent, while fluency and idiomatic style could be refined slightly. Technical terminology is handled consistently, and the adaptation respects the target audience’s expectations.\n\nRecommended minor edits: replace “Vea:” with a more natural cue such as “Observe que” or “Tenga en cuenta que”, and adjust a couple of punctuation marks. These changes would bring the fluency score closer to the other categories.\n\nOverall score (average): 18.2 / 20"
