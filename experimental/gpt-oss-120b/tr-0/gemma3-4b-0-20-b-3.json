  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas, and complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto are explained clearly. Minor punctuation errors (extra commas, misplaced quotation marks) and occasional overly long sentences slightly reduce flow, but the overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., \"cuando abre una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío\" instead of \"parte de un contexto vacío\", \"es una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\"). Some punctuation is inconsistent, and a few English‑style parenthetical quotes remain. These issues prevent it from being fully native‑like.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"anclaje\". The translation stays consistent throughout. The only minor point is the redundant parenthetical \"(anclaje)\" after introducing the term, where a brief explanation of \"grounding\" could have been added.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original podcast script are preserved. Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is required. A few idiomatic French expressions could have been rendered with more idiomatic Spanish equivalents, but the overall message remains faithful.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French source are present: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, memoria temporal vs permanente, y la función de \"Memoria\". No salient information is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary content. Slight formatting leftovers (trailing commas) do not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the technical content effectively. It reads well for a Spanish‑speaking audience, though a few grammatical slips and redundant parentheticals keep it from being perfectly polished. Overall, it is a solid, understandable rendering of the original podcast script.\n\nStrengths: correct terminology, faithful transmission of concepts, good completeness.\nWeaknesses: occasional awkward phrasing, minor punctuation issues, and a small redundancy in term presentation.\n\nWith a quick proofreading pass, the text would reach a near‑native level of fluency.\n\nOverall score (sum of the five criteria): 82/100."
