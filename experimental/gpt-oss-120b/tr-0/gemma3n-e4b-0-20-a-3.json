  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow, sentences are generally clear and the logical flow mirrors the original. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje y aprendizaje en contexto are explained in plain language. Minor issues are occasional long sentences that could be split for smoother reading.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. A few expressions are slightly awkward (e.g., \"Y soy Luc\", \"forma astucia\", \"Se puede tener una conversación larga\") but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning (ajuste fino), aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, prompt, etc. The only minor point is the retention of the English word *prompt*, which is acceptable in a technical context but could have been italicised or explained.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts idioms to Spanish. Cultural references are neutral and appropriate. Small inaccuracies such as \"una forma astucia\" (should be \"una forma astuta\" or \"ingeniosa\") slightly reduce the adaptation quality.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present. No content is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The technical explanations remain intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains readability, and uses appropriate terminology. Minor stylistic and phrasing issues prevent it from being perfect, but they do not affect the listener’s understanding. The work is solid for a podcast script aimed at a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nOverall score: 18/20."
