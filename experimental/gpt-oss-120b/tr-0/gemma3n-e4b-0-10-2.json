  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow; sentences are mostly well‑structured and the concepts are explained clearly. A few long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but overall a Spanish‑speaking listener can understand everything without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are occasional awkward or overly formal expressions (e.g., \"Usted ha entendido todo\", \"una forma astucia de aprendizaje en contexto\", \"como memorizar de memoria\"). These do not impede comprehension but slightly reduce the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning (ajuste fino)\", \"transfer learning\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\" and \"grounding\" are all rendered appropriately and consistently. No major mistranslations.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The podcast tone is largely preserved, and cultural references are neutral, fitting a Spanish‑language audience. Minor mismatches in register (formal \"Usted\" vs the informal original) slightly affect the conversational vibe.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present; no content is omitted or added unnecessarily. The translation keeps the same length and detail, maintaining the original message.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and keeps the original podcast’s explanatory style. Minor issues with fluency and register prevent a perfect score, but the text is clear, technically sound, and faithful to the source.\n\nStrengths: precise terminology, complete information, good readability. Areas for improvement: smoother, more colloquial phrasing in a few spots and consistent use of informal pronouns to match the original conversational tone.\n\nThe translation would be readily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners interested in AI concepts, and it effectively preserves the intent of the original French dialogue."
