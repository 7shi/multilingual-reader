  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured, the flow of the dialogue is preserved and the technical concepts are explained in a clear manner. A few minor typographical issues (e.g., missing accent in “olvidado”) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, but there are occasional awkward constructions such as “La IA no tiene 'olvidado' …” and the phrasing of the ICL acronym. These small hiccups prevent a completely seamless reading experience for native speakers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto/ICL) are rendered correctly and consistently. The choice of “afinamiento” instead of the more common “ajuste fino” is acceptable in the given context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational tone, humor and analogies are well‑preserved. No cultural references are lost, and the translation adapts idioms appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present. No ideas are omitted or altered, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the original content accurately, keeps the technical depth, and is largely readable and natural. Minor grammatical slips keep it from being perfect, but they do not affect the overall understanding.\n\nStrengths: faithful content transfer, consistent terminology, good adaptation of tone.\nWeaknesses: occasional awkward phrasing and a small typo that slightly affect fluency.\n\nThe translation would be readily usable for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience with only minimal post‑editing needed for polish.\n\nOverall score (average): 18.2 → rounded to 18/20."
