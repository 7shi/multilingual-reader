  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are short and the flow mirrors the original dialogue, making the concepts clear. Minor hiccups such as the use of \"la afinar\" instead of a more natural \"el afinado\" slightly hinder smooth reading, but overall comprehension is not affected.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several awkward or ungrammatical constructions: mixing formal \"Usted\" with informal tone, the literal \"Aprendizaje en Contexto Interno\" for ICL, the English‑Spanish blend \"cuando starts\", missing accents (\"Se puede decir eso\"), and occasional unnecessary exclamation marks. These issues make the text feel stilted for a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is mostly handled well – pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia, ventana de contexto, afinado, etc. However, some terms are mistranslated or inconsistent: \"ancoraje\" should be \"anclaje\", ICL is incorrectly expanded, and \"prompt\" is left untranslated without explanation. The overall terminology is understandable but not fully accurate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone and keeps cultural references, but it unnecessarily changes the show’s name from \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Tech Flash\" and retains a few English words, which can break immersion for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The adaptation is adequate but not optimal.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the original script are present; no significant content is omitted. Minor errors (e.g., \"cuando starts\" and a few typographical slips) do not remove information, so the completeness is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original dialogue’s educational content and overall structure well, but it suffers from several fluency and terminology inaccuracies that make it feel less natural to native Spanish readers. A careful proofreading and refinement of technical terms would raise the quality substantially.\nOverall, the work is solid in completeness and readability, but needs polishing for fluency and precise terminology.\nOverall score: 16/20."
