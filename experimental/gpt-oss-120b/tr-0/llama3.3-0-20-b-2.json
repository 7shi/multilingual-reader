  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow and the ideas are clearly expressed. Sentence structures are logical, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can grasp. Minor issues such as occasional long sentences and a few punctuation quirks do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation reads naturally, but there are several spots that feel slightly off for native speakers: mixed use of \"Usted\" and \"tú\" (e.g., \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\"), the choice of \"anclaje\" for \"grounding\", and a few literal constructions like \"Es allí donde interviene\". These awkwardnesses prevent a perfect fluency rating.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled appropriately: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\" (fine‑tuning), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\" and \"grounding\" are all correctly rendered. While \"afinamiento\" could be debated in favor of \"ajuste fino\", the chosen terminology is consistent and understandable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast’s conversational tone and adapts cultural references smoothly (e.g., using \"consultor\" instead of \"consultant\"). The only slight drawback is the occasional formal‑informal mix, but the overall intent and style are well conveyed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present. No sentences or ideas are omitted, and the logical flow of the dialogue is maintained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the original content accurately, with clear explanations of complex AI concepts. Minor stylistic slips (formal/informal pronoun mix, occasional literal phrasing) keep it from being completely natural, but the terminology is precise and the information is complete. Overall a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI topics.\n\nOverall score: 17/20."
