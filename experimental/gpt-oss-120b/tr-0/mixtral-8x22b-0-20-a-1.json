  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the flow mirrors the original dialogue, allowing readers to grasp the concepts without difficulty. A few minor phrasing choices are slightly formal for spoken podcast style, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are a handful of awkward expressions (e.g., “hacer trampa para un examen”, “ventana de contexto” used without prior definition, retention of the French word *ancrage*). These quirks make the text feel a bit stilted in places, though a native speaker would still understand it without effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto* are appropriate. The abbreviation “AIC” is introduced instead of the more common “ICL”, and the French term *ancrage* is left untranslated, which reduces consistency. Nonetheless, the core terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish well, using appropriate discourse markers. Some French‑specific words are retained (*ancrage*), and the abbreviation change (AIC) could confuse Spanish‑speaking readers unfamiliar with the original term. Cultural adaptation is otherwise solid.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present. No ideas or examples are omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is preserved. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy and keeps the content concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast’s content accurately and is generally readable and faithful to the technical discussion. Minor issues with fluency and terminology consistency prevent it from being perfect, but it remains a high‑quality rendering suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\nStrengths: completeness, clear exposition of complex ideas, appropriate technical vocabulary. \nAreas for improvement: smoother colloquial phrasing, consistent use of Spanish equivalents for all French terms, and a more standard abbreviation for In‑Context Learning.\n\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 87/100."
