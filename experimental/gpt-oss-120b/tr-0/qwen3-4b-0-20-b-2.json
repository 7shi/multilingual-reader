  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the logical flow mirrors the original French. However, there are several grammatical slips (e.g., \"bienvenido en\" instead of \"bienvenido a\", \"el aprendizaje a la vuela\" which is a malformed idiom, and inconsistent use of formal \"usted\" vs informal \"tú\"). These errors slightly hinder smooth comprehension for native readers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound natural, but a number of expressions feel awkward or literal (e.g., \"Usted ha entendido todo\", \"una memoria de uso único\", \"antisecha\" for \"antisèche\"). The register shifts inconsistently, and a few word choices are odd, reducing the overall fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (Aprendizaje en contexto)\", \"anclaje\" for \"grounding\", and the term \"prompt\" is left unchanged, which is appropriate for the target audience. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and purpose accurately. Cultural adaptation is minimal but acceptable. The main drawback is the inconsistent register and the erroneous idiom \"a la vuela\", which slightly detracts from a fully adapted text.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points, examples, and analogies from the French script are retained. No substantial information is omitted, and the structure mirrors the source, keeping the content complete and coherent.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully transmits the technical content and overall narrative of the podcast, with accurate terminology and complete information. Nevertheless, recurring grammatical mistakes, occasional unnatural phrasing, and inconsistent use of formal/informal address lower its readability and fluency. A careful proofread and a more consistent register would bring the translation to a higher level of polish.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 17/20.\n\nScore: 17"
