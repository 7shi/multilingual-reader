  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are clear and easy to follow. Sentences are slightly long in places but remain comprehensible for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall. Minor issues such as punctuation errors (e.g., missing closing exclamation marks) and the use of \"entre bambalinas\" instead of the more common \"entre bastidores\" do not significantly hinder understanding, but they slightly reduce native‑speaker smoothness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\". Consistency is maintained throughout. The only slight lapse is the retention of the English word \"cheat sheet\" in quotes, which could have been localized.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts idioms appropriately for Spanish speakers. Cultural references are neutral, and the explanatory tone is kept. The English loan \"cheat sheet\" is a minor cultural mismatch, but overall the adaptation is strong.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No content is omitted, and the supplemental explanations (e.g., analogies) are fully retained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the technical content and conversational style of the original podcast. Minor stylistic and punctuation issues prevent a perfect score, but the text is readable, fluent, and technically accurate, making it suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
