    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear, step‑by‑step manner. Even complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in language that a non‑expert can follow. A few sentences are a bit long, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic, but there are occasional constructions that feel slightly forced or overly literal (e.g., “Se puede decir eso” instead of “Se podría decir eso”, “el ajuste” for “fine‑tuning”). Overall, a native speaker would understand it without effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “anclaje”. The only weak point is the translation of “fine‑tuning” as “el ajuste”; the more common “afinamiento” or “ajuste fino” would have been clearer. Consistency is maintained throughout the dialogue.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational tone, the use of analogies (consultant, exam cramming, bicycle) and the cultural references are preserved. The translator adapts the speech to Spanish‑speaking audiences without losing the original intent. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve engagement, but the adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No key idea, example, or nuance has been omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The completeness is therefore very high.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate, comprehensive and largely readable. It conveys the original podcast script’s educational purpose and conversational style effectively. The main areas for improvement are the choice of a more precise term for \"fine‑tuning\" and smoothing a few slightly awkward phrasing choices. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts."
