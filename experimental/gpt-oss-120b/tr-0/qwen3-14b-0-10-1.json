    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the structure of the original dialogue. Most sentences are clear, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can follow. However, a few lexical slips (e.g., “bacchar”, the French word “incroyablement”, and occasional awkward phrasing) slightly hinder smooth comprehension for native Spanish readers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally, but several expressions feel literal or foreign‑language‑laden. Phrases such as “bacchar para un examen”, “incroyablement ineficaz”, and the retention of French quotation marks make the text sound stilted. Overall, the flow is acceptable but not fully idiomatic.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely well‑handled: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento (fine‑tuning)”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and “anclaje (grounding)” are correctly translated and consistently used. Minor issues arise from the occasional French term that slips through, but the core terminology is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and maintains the podcast‑style conversational tone. Cultural adaptation is modest; most expressions are understandable to Spanish speakers, though some literal translations (e.g., “consultor brillante” instead of a more common “consultor experto”) and the mixed‑language remnants reduce the feeling of a fully localized text.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the explanations remain intact. The only drawback is the inclusion of a few French words that do not add value, but they do not cause loss of meaning.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation does a solid job of transferring the technical content and conversational style of the original French podcast into Spanish. The main weaknesses are occasional lexical slips and the presence of untranslated French words, which affect readability and fluency. Terminology is accurate and consistent, and the message is fully preserved. With a few editorial passes to remove the French remnants and to smooth idiomatic phrasing, the translation would reach a higher level of naturalness for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\n**Final score (out of 100): 72**\n\n**Strengths:** correct technical terminology, complete conveyance of information, clear structure.\n**Areas for improvement:** eliminate French interjections, replace non‑Spanish slang (\"bacchar\") with appropriate Spanish terms, refine idiomatic expressions for smoother flow."
