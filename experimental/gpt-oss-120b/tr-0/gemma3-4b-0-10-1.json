    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the dialogue clearly and the logical flow of the discussion is preserved. Most sentences are easy to follow, and the technical concepts are introduced with adequate explanations. Minor issues such as a slightly clunky phrase “ha simplemente sido vacío” slightly hinder smooth comprehension, but overall the reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly naturally, but there are a few literal constructions that feel odd to a native speaker (e.g., “el concepto de « anclaje » (anclaje)”, “su espacio de trabajo temporal ha simplemente sido vacío”). The use of asterisks around *prompt* and the occasional French‑style quotation marks also give a slightly foreign feel. Nevertheless, the text flows well enough for everyday listening.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, prompt, etc., are consistently translated and kept in their accepted Spanish forms. The only slight lapse is the translation of “grounding” as simply “anclaje” without a brief clarification, but the term is still recognizable for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts the content to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Cultural references are neutral, and the conversational tone is maintained. Minor oversights, such as the redundant parenthetical “(anclaje)” and the leftover note about a Spanish‑speaking exclamation, slightly detract from perfect adaptation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the substantive information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are intact. The only minor loss is the nuanced explanation of “grounding”, which is reduced to a single word, but the overall message remains complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the original podcast script into Spanish. It maintains the educational tone, preserves the technical depth, and is largely understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Some literal translations and occasional awkward phrasing prevent it from being perfectly fluent, and a brief clarification of the term “grounding” would improve precision. Nonetheless, the translation is accurate, comprehensive, and functional for its intended purpose."
