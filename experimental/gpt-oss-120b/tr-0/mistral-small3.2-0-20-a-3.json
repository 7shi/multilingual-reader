  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas without excessive complexity, and listeners can grasp the concepts of pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, y aprendizaje en contexto. A few very long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary and verb tenses are appropriate, and the dialogue flows. Minor awkward phrasing appears (e.g., “una cantidad mucho menor de texto en francés”, “el modelo en sí no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus discusiones”), which a native speaker might phrase slightly differently, but these do not hinder understanding.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), grounding → anclaje. The choice of “afinamiento” for fine‑tuning is acceptable though “ajuste fino” is more common; otherwise the terminology is consistent and accurate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical analogies (consultor temporal vs experto permanente, repasar para un examen). Cultural references are neutral, and the language is adapted to a Spanish‑speaking audience without losing the explanatory style.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No sentences are omitted, and no additional, unnecessary content is introduced. The meaning and nuances are fully retained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains largely natural and readable, and keeps the original conversational tone. A few minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but the work is solid and ready for a Spanish‑language podcast audience.\nScore: 91/100 (sum of the five criteria)."
