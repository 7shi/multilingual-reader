  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the original structure. Most sentences convey the intended meaning, and technical concepts are explained. However, there are several grammatical slips (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en…”, missing preposition “a”, occasional awkward phrasing) that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains multiple unnatural expressions and typographical errors: “bienvenido en” should be “bienvenido a”, “antiespia” is a misspelling of “antisèche”, and constructions such as “El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje” are grammatically odd. These issues make the text feel less native‑speaker‑like.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly rendered (preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding). The choice of “afinamiento” for fine‑tuning is acceptable, and the occasional use of the English word “prompt” is standard in AI discourse. Consistency is good.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts the examples to Spanish without cultural mismatch. Minor issues such as the use of colloquial “bachear” and the slightly literal rendering of some analogies reduce the naturalness, but the overall message remains clear for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French source is retained. No significant ideas are omitted, and the logical flow of the discussion is preserved. Minor redundancies are present (e.g., repeated “exactamente”), but they do not affect completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full content of the podcast script and keeps the technical depth intact. Strengths lie in accurate terminology and faithful transmission of ideas. Weaknesses are mainly linguistic: several grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and a typo (“antiespia”) that reduce fluency and readability. With a light editorial pass to correct these issues, the translation would be solid for a Spanish‑speaking tech audience.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20.\n\nScore: 16"
