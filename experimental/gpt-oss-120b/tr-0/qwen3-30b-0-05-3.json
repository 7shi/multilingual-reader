    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas flow logically. Sentences are understandable, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can follow. A few sentences are rather long, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several awkward or non‑idiomatic expressions: *pre‑entrenamiento* (normally *preentrenamiento*), *la afinación* (more common *el afinamiento* or *el ajuste fino*), *estudiar a último momento* (should be *estudiar a última hora*), and the phrase about riding a bike (*montar en silla*) which is a clear mistranslation. These issues break the natural flow for native speakers, though the overall meaning remains intact.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)*, *ventana de contexto*, *anclaje*, etc. However, the translation of *fine‑tuning* as *afinación* is less common than *ajuste fino*, and the term *prompt* is left untranslated, which could be confusing for some readers. Consistency could be improved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator succeeded in preserving the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but a few expressions are not fully idiomatic (e.g., *estudiar a último momento*). Overall the adaptation is solid, with only minor linguistic slips.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the dialogue structure is kept intact. Redundancies are minimal, and the translation stays faithful to the original content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast content accurately and maintains the explanatory flow, which is crucial for a technical audience. Readability and completeness are strong points. Nevertheless, fluency suffers from several non‑idiomatic phrases and a noticeable mistranslation regarding bicycle riding, which detracts from the naturalness of the text. Terminology is mostly appropriate but could be more consistent with standard Spanish technical jargon. With a few revisions to idiomatic phrasing and terminology uniformity, the translation would reach a higher level of polish."
