  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are presented in a logical order. Minor hiccups such as a slightly long sentence about hiring a consultant do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for native speakers. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic, with only a few marginal issues (e.g., \"informaciones\" instead of the singular \"información\", or the very formal \"usted\" in a mostly informal podcast tone). Overall the flow is smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding, etc. They are either kept in the original language with a parenthetical translation or rendered with the accepted Spanish equivalent. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve precision, but terminology is accurate.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a lively podcast. Cultural references are adapted (e.g., \"¡Hola y bienvenidos!\") and the register is mostly appropriate. The occasional switch to the formal \"usted\" creates a slight mismatch with the otherwise informal style, but it does not alter the message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is retained. No sentences or nuances are omitted, and the logical progression of the discussion is maintained. The only minor redundancy is the repetition of \"es como\" constructions, which does not affect completeness.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, reads naturally, and stays faithful to the original dialogue. The few minor issues (formal pronoun choice, slight wordiness) prevent a perfect score but do not hinder understanding.\n\nFinal rating: 18 / 20 (average of the five criteria)."
