  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the conversational flow of the original French podcast. Sentences are mostly clear and the complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained in simple terms. The only minor drawback is a few long sentences that could be split for easier reading, but overall a Spanish‑speaking audience can follow the discussion without difficulty.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary such as “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “ventana de contexto” and “aprendizaje en contexto” is appropriate and contemporary. A couple of expressions feel slightly literal – e.g., “parte de un contexto vacío” could be “parte con un contexto vacío”, and “funcionalidades como la «Memoria»” might be smoother as “características como la “Memoria””. These are minor and do not break fluency.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled consistently and correctly. Key terms (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding, memoria a corto plazo) are rendered with accepted Spanish equivalents. When necessary, brief explanations are kept (e.g., “repaso intensivo” for “bachotage”). No confusing or inconsistent jargon appears.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and tone of a podcast aimed at a broad audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the examples (consultant analogy, bicycle learning) are conveyed effectively. A few stylistic choices are a bit literal, but they do not hinder the intended message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No segment is omitted, and the explanatory additions (e.g., clarifying “repaso intensivo”) are faithful to the original meaning. Redundancy is avoided, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It accurately transmits the technical content and the conversational style of the original podcast, using appropriate Spanish terminology and maintaining readability. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve naturalness, but they are not significant. Overall, the work is a strong, faithful rendering of the source text."
