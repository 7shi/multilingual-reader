  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall easy to follow. Sentences are mostly clear and the logical flow of the podcast dialogue is preserved. A few minor awkward phrasings (e.g., \"se le dan las informaciones de las que necesita\") do not impede comprehension, but they slightly reduce smoothness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are several spots where the wording feels literal or unidiomatic (e.g., \"el afinado\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\", mixed use of \"su\"/\"vuestra\", and redundant expressions). These issues make the text feel a bit stilted for native speakers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje, etc. The choice of \"afinado\" for fine‑tuning is acceptable, though \"ajuste fino\" would be more standard. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent, tone, and podcast style are well preserved. Cultural references are neutral, and the Spanish version adapts the discourse to a native‑speaker audience without loss of meaning. Minor punctuation inconsistencies (missing inverted exclamation marks) are the only drawback.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No relevant idea is omitted, and the translation even adds a small clarification for \"antisèche\" by using \"apunte\", which is appropriate.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. Readability and completeness are strong, while fluency suffers from a few literal renderings and less idiomatic phrasing. Technical terminology is handled well, though a few more common Spanish equivalents could improve the natural feel. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation that only needs minor polishing for native‑speaker smoothness.\n\nScore (sum of criteria): 89/100."
