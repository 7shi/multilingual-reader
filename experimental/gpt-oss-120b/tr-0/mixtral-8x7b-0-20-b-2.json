    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original script. Most sentences are easy to understand, and complex concepts are explained with suitable examples. Minor issues such as occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., “el aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”) and a few punctuation quirks slightly affect smoothness, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, using appropriate everyday vocabulary. However, there are some unnatural lexical choices – notably “ancraje” for grounding (the usual term is “anclaje” or “enraizamiento”) and “borrador” for “antisèche”. Redundant parenthetical expansions (ICL) and a few literal translations make certain passages feel slightly stilted.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje de transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, etc. The only notable error is the translation of “grounding” as “ancraje”, which is not a recognized term in Spanish AI literature. This inconsistency reduces the overall score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational style. Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience, and the conversational format is maintained. Minor lexical mismatches (e.g., “borrador” instead of a more precise “hoja de trucos”) do not alter the meaning significantly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the explanations remain complete. The only loss is the slight nuance caused by the inaccurate term “ancraje”, but the overall content stays intact.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and is easy to follow. It succeeds in delivering the technical explanations in a clear manner, though a few terminology choices (especially “ancraje”) and occasional awkward phrasing prevent it from being perfectly fluent. Minor lexical adjustments would raise the quality to near‑native level.\n\nStrengths: clear structure, faithful content, good handling of most technical terms. Areas for improvement: correct the translation of “grounding”, avoid redundant parenthetical expansions, and choose more idiomatic words for certain concepts.\n\nScore out of 100: 81/100."
