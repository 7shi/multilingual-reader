  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. Sentence structures are logical, and most of the dialogue flows naturally. However, there is a noticeable truncation after “Camille: Es decir, ¿” which leaves a fragment incomplete, slightly hindering comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly sounds natural, but a few expressions feel awkward for native speakers (e.g., “Ustedes han entendido todo.”, “las cosas” instead of a more specific term). Minor punctuation issues (missing question mark) and occasional literal renderings reduce smoothness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje (grounding). The terminology is consistent throughout and appropriate for the target audience, even if “afinamiento” could be replaced by the more common “ajuste fino”.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the explanatory style is maintained. Minor issues like the plural “Ustedes” versus a singular “tú” are present but do not affect overall comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present, and no essential information is omitted. The only loss is the incomplete sentence after “Camille: Es decir, ¿”, which creates a small gap. Otherwise, the content is complete and coherent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. Minor linguistic slips and a truncated fragment prevent it from being perfect, but the core message and terminology are well preserved, making it a useful and understandable Spanish version of the podcast script.\n\nStrengths: correct handling of technical vocabulary, faithful conveyance of concepts, generally clear structure.\nWeaknesses: occasional unnatural phrasing, missing fragment, small punctuation oversights.\n\nThe translation would benefit from a final proofreading pass to fix the incomplete line and smooth out the few awkward expressions.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 82/100."
