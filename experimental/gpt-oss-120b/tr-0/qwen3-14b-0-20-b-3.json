    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto are explained clearly with analogías que facilitan la comprensión. Some sentences are a bit long, but overall a reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few passages are literal renderings that feel slightly awkward for a native speaker (e.g., \"su espacio de trabajo temporal simplemente ha sido vaciado\", \"se le ha proporcionado simplemente un resumen justo antes de que comenzara a hablarle\"). The use of the formal \"usted\" is consistent, though the original had a more conversational tone. Overall the flow is good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje (grounding). The word \"prompt\" is kept in English, which is acceptable in Spanish technical discourse, and the translation stays consistent throughout. No major terminology errors.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast’s informal, explanatory style and adapts the register appropriately (formal \"usted\" matches the French \"vous\"). Cultural references are neutral, so no mis‑alignments appear. The analogías (consultor brillante, estudiante de último minuto) work well in Spanish.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present. No ideas are omitted, and the logical sequence is maintained. The description of the \"Memoria\" feature is fully conveyed.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the original content effectively. It is readable and technically sound, with only minor fluency hiccups that stem from literal phrasing. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nScore: 89/100 (sum of the five criteria)."
