  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained in a way that a non‑expert can grasp. Minor hiccups such as slightly long sentences do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural to a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. A few expressions feel a bit literal (e.g., \"una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\"), but they do not break the flow. The dialogue tone is preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, ventana de contexto, anclaje, etc. Consistency is maintained throughout the script. The choice of \"afinamiento\" for fine‑tuning and \"anclaje\" for grounding is standard in Spanish AI literature.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts idioms to Spanish culture (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", \"chuleta\" for cheat‑sheet). No French‑specific references remain that would confuse a Spanish‑speaking audience. Slightly formal register in a few spots, but still appropriate for a tech podcast.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and no unnecessary repetitions are added. The explanations are as complete as the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational tone of the podcast, and is easily understandable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor stylistic tweaks could make a few sentences feel more fluid, but they do not detract from the overall effectiveness.\n\nStrengths: precise terminology, faithful rendering of concepts, good cultural adaptation. Areas for improvement: streamline a couple of overly literal phrases to enhance naturalness.\nOverall the work meets professional standards for technical translation.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17.6 → 18/20."
