  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version presents the ideas in a clear, logical order. Sentences are generally short enough to be easily followed, and the analogies (e.g., “estudiar de memoria para un examen”) are well‑translated, helping non‑expert readers grasp the concepts. A few sentences are a bit long (“cuando comienza una nueva conversación…”) but they remain comprehensible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “ventana de contexto” and “aprendizaje en contexto” are idiomatic. Minor awkwardness appears in phrases like “memoria de uso único” (more common would be “memoria de un solo uso”) and “un apuntador justo antes de que comience a hablar contigo” (a slightly forced literal translation). These do not break understanding but slightly reduce smoothness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently. English loanwords are either kept in the original form with a Spanish explanation (e.g., “fine‑tuning (ajuste fino)”, “grounding (anclaje)”) or replaced by standard Spanish equivalents. The translation also retains the specific AI jargon (ICL, transferencia, afinado) without confusing the reader.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The tone remains conversational and podcast‑like, and the examples are kept relevant. No cultural mismatches are observed, and the adaptation improves clarity for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is omitted, and the explanations are kept faithful to the source. Redundancies are minimal, and the translation does not add unnecessary material.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the original conversational tone, and is largely easy to read for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor stylistic tweaks could make a few expressions sound more natural, but they do not detract from the overall effectiveness of the translation.\nScore: 18/20."
