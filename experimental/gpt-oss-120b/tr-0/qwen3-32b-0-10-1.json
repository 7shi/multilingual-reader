  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained clearly. Minor hiccups such as a slightly long sentence in the middle of the dialogue do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. A few phrases feel a bit literal – e.g., “Verán:” and “El afinamiento” – but they do not break the flow. Overall the text sounds like a spoken podcast in Spanish.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". The translation is consistent throughout and the occasional English acronym is kept with its Spanish explanation, which is helpful for the target audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The tone, humor and podcast‑style dialogue are preserved. Cultural references are neutral, so no adaptation is required, and the translation respects the informal, conversational register expected in a Spanish‑language tech podcast. Slightly formal wording in a couple of places could be softened, but the overall intent is fully conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary nature of prompt‑provided knowledge, and the “memory” feature as a clever shortcut. No substantive information is lost or added unnecessarily.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It preserves the educational yet friendly tone of the original podcast, conveys all technical concepts accurately, and remains readable and natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency a bit, but they do not detract from the overall effectiveness. The work demonstrates solid competence in both linguistic and domain‑specific translation skills."
