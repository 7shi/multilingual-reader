    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the complex AI concepts are explained clearly, mirroring the original French. Sentence structures are logical, and the flow of the dialogue between Camille and Luc is preserved. Minor issues such as the redundant parenthetical “(anclaje)” and occasional overly long sentences do not significantly hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, but there are a few awkward phrasings (“el concepto de « anclaje » (anclaje)”, “el *prompt*” left in English, “cuando abre una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío” where the verb should be singular). These small slips prevent a perfectly native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “prompt”. The choice of “anclaje” for “grounding” is acceptable, though not the most common translation, it remains consistent throughout. No major terminology errors.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the podcast tone, uses appropriate Spanish punctuation and style, and adapts cultural references (e.g., using “consultor brillante”). The only missing piece is the unfinished note about the Spanish exclamation, which is a minor editorial oversight rather than a contextual problem.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and analogies from the original are present. No substantive information is lost or added unnecessarily. The translation retains the full logical progression of the discussion.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the original content effectively. Readability and terminology are strong, and the essential information is fully preserved. Fluency suffers from a handful of minor awkward constructions, and the choice of \"anclaje\" for \"grounding\" could be refined, but these issues do not detract significantly from the quality. The piece would benefit from a final proofread to smooth out the few grammatical slips and to complete the dangling editorial note at the end.\n\nFinal scores (out of 20 each):\n- Readability: 17\n- Fluency: 16\n- Terminology: 18\n- Contextual Adaptation: 17\n- Information Completeness: 19"
