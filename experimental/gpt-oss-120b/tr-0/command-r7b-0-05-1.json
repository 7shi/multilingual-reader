  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are short and the logical flow mirrors the original French script. Listeners can understand the concepts without difficulty. Minor punctuation omissions (missing closing exclamation marks) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part. There are a few awkward choices or typos such as “Trasfiere” (should be *Transfiere*), “ancoraje” (the usual term is *anclaje*), and occasional missing punctuation. These issues slightly break the fluidity but the overall style is conversational and appropriate for a podcast.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well‑handled: *preentrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning* rendered as “el ajuste”/“afinamiento”, *in‑context learning* as “aprendizaje en contexto”, etc. A more precise translation would use *ajuste fino* for fine‑tuning and keep *ICL* as an acronym, but the chosen terms are understandable and consistent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator kept the informal podcast tone, used culturally appropriate expressions (e.g., “consultor brillante”, “da la impresión”), and preserved the original intent. No cultural references were lost, and the adaptation feels natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is present. No sentences or ideas were omitted, and the technical explanations remain intact. The translation is faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is very good. It conveys the technical content accurately and retains the lively, conversational style of the podcast. Minor typographical errors and a few non‑standard term choices prevent it from being perfect, but they do not affect the listener’s understanding. With a quick proofread to fix the typos and standardise a couple of technical terms, it would be excellent.\n\nFinal aggregate score (out of 100): 89/100."
