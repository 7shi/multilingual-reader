  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow; sentences are logically ordered and the dialogue format is preserved. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in clear language. A few long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but overall comprehension is not hindered.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most of the text. There are occasional slightly awkward turns (e.g., “el ajuste” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”, “una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”), but these do not break the flow. Vocabulary is appropriate for a tech‑savvy podcast audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “grounding”. The only minor point is that “fine‑tuning” is usually translated as “ajuste fino”, but the chosen term is still understandable and used consistently.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts well to a Spanish‑speaking podcast context, using informal “tú” that matches the conversational tone. Cultural references are neutral, and the examples (e.g., consultant analogy) are preserved. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve resonance, but the intent and purpose are fully conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present. No sentences or key concepts are omitted, and the dialogue structure is maintained. The translation even adds clarifying parentheses where the original had them, aiding understanding without adding redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It faithfully reproduces the original content, maintains the educational and conversational tone, and uses appropriate technical language. Minor improvements could be made in fluency (especially for a few idiomatic expressions) and in choosing the most common Spanish equivalents for some technical terms, but these do not significantly affect the listener’s experience. The work is ready for publication in a Spanish‑language tech podcast.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.4/20 → rounded to 18.5/20."
