  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and the ideas are conveyed in a logical order. Listeners can follow the discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning without major confusion. A few sentences are a bit word‑heavy (e.g., the explanation of forgetting), but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several literal constructions that feel slightly awkward to a native speaker: “Se puede tomar un modelo experto en inglés, y le presentar…”, “El afinamiento” instead of the more usual “el ajuste fino”, and the phrase “una hoja de trucos”. These minor issues prevent a perfect fluency rating.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally well‑handled: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “ventana de contexto”, “grounding → anclaje”. The only inconsistency is the switch between “ajuste fino” and “afinamiento”. Overall the terminology is appropriate and consistent enough for the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast tone and intent. Cultural references are neutral, and the explanations are adapted to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor lexical choices (e.g., “hoja de trucos” instead of a more idiomatic “chuleta”) could be refined, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is retained. No significant content is omitted or altered, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue. The translation does not add unnecessary material, keeping the content concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version is a solid translation that conveys the technical discussion clearly and faithfully. While readability and completeness are strong, fluency and terminology could be polished slightly—especially by smoothing literal constructions and using the more common term “ajuste fino” throughout. With minor edits, the translation would read as naturally as the original French script.\nOverall score (sum of the five criteria): 83/100."
