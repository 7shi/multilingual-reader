  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the concepts are explained in an accessible way. However, there is a noticeable typo (“relearnir” instead of “reaprender”) and a few slightly awkward constructions that slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, using appropriate everyday vocabulary and a conversational tone that matches the podcast format. Some expressions feel a bit forced (e.g., the abbreviation “AEC” for Aprendizaje en Contexto, which is not a standard term in Spanish) and a few sentences are mildly stilted, preventing a perfect native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"anclaje\" are correctly rendered and used consistently. The only minor issue is the change of the original abbreviation ICL to AEC, which could cause slight confusion but does not alter the meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original intent well, preserving the podcast’s informal, explanatory style and using culturally appropriate phrasing (e.g., \"consultor\", \"antisèche\"). The overall message and persuasive analogies are maintained, making the content relevant for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key information from the French source is retained. No substantive ideas are omitted, and the flow of the dialogue remains intact. The only loss is the explicit mention of the original abbreviation ICL, which is replaced by AEC, but the concept is still conveyed.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational tone of the podcast, and adapts well to Spanish‑speaking audiences. Minor typographical errors and a few non‑standard abbreviations keep it from being perfect, but the translation is still very effective and informative.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 17, Fluency 16, Terminology 18, Contextual Adaptation 18, Information Completeness 19 – total 88/100.\n\nRecommended improvements: correct the typo \"relearnir\", consider using the more familiar abbreviation \"ICL\" (Aprendizaje en Contexto) or explain the new acronym, and smooth out the few slightly stilted sentences for a more native feel."
