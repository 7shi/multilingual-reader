    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas, and complex concepts are explained with simple language. Minor awkwardness appears in a few openings (e.g., “Y yo soy Luc.”) and the lack of an article before \"Tech Éclair\", but these do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most of the podcast, but there are occasional colloquial or literal turns that feel slightly out of place in a professional tech podcast: \"levantar el velo\", \"chivatazo\", and the redundant use of asterisks for bold. The shift of the podcast name at the end to \"Tecno Relámpago\" also breaks the flow. Overall, fluency is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, etc. \"Afinamiento\" is less common than \"ajuste fino\", but it is understandable and used consistently. The only inconsistency is the final change of the podcast title, which is a naming issue rather than a term error.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content well for a Spanish‑speaking audience, preserving the explanatory tone. The occasional colloquial word \"chivatazo\" may feel too informal for the target audience, and the inconsistent handling of the podcast name (kept French initially, then translated) slightly harms cultural coherence. Still, the overall intent and tone are preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No ideas or examples are omitted, and the explanations remain intact. The only minor deviation is the final title change, which does not remove any substantive content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does an excellent job of conveying the technical discussion in a clear and accessible manner. Terminology is accurate and the core concepts are preserved. Minor issues—such as a few unnatural phrasing choices, a colloquial term that may not suit the podcast’s style, and an inconsistent treatment of the podcast’s name—prevent it from being perfect, but the overall quality is high and the content is complete.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 17/20."
