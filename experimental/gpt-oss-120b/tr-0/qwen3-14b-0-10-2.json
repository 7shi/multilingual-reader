    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original flow, but there are several grammatical slips (e.g., \"se percibe estas IA\" instead of \"se perciben\", missing articles, mixed French‑Spanish punctuation) that slightly hinder smooth reading. The concepts are explained, but occasional awkward phrasing forces the reader to re‑parse the sentence.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in many places, yet some literal renderings and a few lexical choices feel odd for a native speaker (e.g., \"incroyablement ineficaz\", \"bacchar\" kept unchanged, and the use of French guillemets « »). These issues break the fluidity of the narrative, though overall the message is clear.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\" (although \"ajuste fino\" would be more common), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL), and \"anclaje\" for grounding are all appropriate and consistent. Minor inconsistencies (e.g., keeping \"prompt\" in English) do not substantially affect comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the original intent and conversational tone. However, cultural and linguistic nuances are sometimes missed: the French word \"incroyablement\" appears unchanged, and \"bacchar\" is a slang term not universally recognized in Spanish. These reduce the adaptation quality despite overall fidelity.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the logical sequence of the discussion is maintained. Minor typographic errors do not affect content completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and retains the podcast’s explanatory style. Nevertheless, grammatical errors, occasional code‑switching with French words, and a few unnatural lexical choices prevent it from reaching a higher level of polish. A revision focusing on Spanish grammar, consistent use of Spanish terminology, and removal of foreign remnants would markedly improve readability and fluency.\n\nOverall, the translation is solid in terms of content and terminology but needs polishing for native‑speaker naturalness.\n\nScore out of 20: 16\n\n**Breakdown:** Readability 15, Fluency 14, Terminology 17, Contextual Adaptation 14, Information Completeness 18. The average of these five criteria yields an overall score of 16/20."
