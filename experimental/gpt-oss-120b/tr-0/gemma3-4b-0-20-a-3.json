  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the explanations of pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino y aprendizaje en contexto are clear. A few long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but the overall comprehension is good.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation sounds natural, but there are occasional awkward phrasings such as “El aprendizaje en contexto es bachorear” (a literal calque) and “Este enfoque es posible gracias a la expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo de la IA, o «ventana de contexto»”. These minor issues prevent full native‑speaker fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled appropriately: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL”, and “anclaje” are all rendered consistently. The translator kept the English acronyms (ICL) and explained them, which is helpful for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of the podcast script. Cultural references are neutral, and the examples (consultor brillante, bicicleta) are adapted well to Spanish. Minor literal translations (e.g., “consultor brillante”) are still understandable and do not hinder the message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No essential points are omitted, and the flow of ideas mirrors the original script. Redundancies are minimal and do not affect clarity.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid overall. It conveys the technical concepts accurately and keeps the conversational style of the podcast. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency could be refined in a few spots to sound more idiomatic. No critical information is lost, making it a reliable rendition for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\nOverall score (out of 100): 88/100."
