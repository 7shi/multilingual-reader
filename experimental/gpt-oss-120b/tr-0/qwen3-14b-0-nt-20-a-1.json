  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. Sentence structures are logical, and the dialogue format is preserved. Minor issues such as occasional long sentences do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural, but there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., \"Usted entiende todo\" instead of \"Usted lo entiende todo\" or \"Entiendes todo\", mixed use of formal \"Usted\" and informal \"tú\", and missing spaces before opening punctuation). Vocabulary is appropriate, yet these small glitches prevent a completely smooth reading experience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered (preentrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, anclaje). The translator kept the original French terms in quotes where needed, maintaining consistency throughout the script.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and adapts the examples to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are preserved and the explanatory tone works well. The only drawback is the inconsistent use of pronouns (formal vs. informal) which slightly reduces the naturalness for a specific target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant details are omitted, and the dialogue flow remains intact. Minor punctuation errors do not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is strong and conveys the technical content accurately. Readability and terminology are solid, and the essential information is fully preserved. Fluency is the main area for improvement, especially regarding pronoun consistency and a few unnatural phrasing choices. With a quick proofread to smooth out those issues, the text would read as a native‑level Spanish podcast script.\n\nScore summary (out of 20 each): Readability 17, Fluency 15, Terminology 18, Contextual Adaptation 16, Information Completeness 19. The average score is 17.0/20, indicating a high‑quality translation with minor room for refinement."
