  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas clearly and the logical flow is preserved. A few constructions are slightly heavy (e.g., very long sentences) and the word \"afinado\" is less common than \"ajuste fino\", but overall a native reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, but there are occasional awkward phrases (e.g., \"Más bien, no enseñarías...\", \"Cuando abre una nueva ventana, parte de un contexto vacío\"). Vocabulary is appropriate and the style matches a podcast script, yet a few minor grammatical quirks prevent a perfect rating.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", etc. Consistency is maintained throughout. The only slight drawback is the translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"afinación\" instead of the more usual \"ajuste fino\" or \"fine‑tuning\", but the meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and purpose of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral and appropriate for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Minor regional choices (e.g., \"vuestras conversaciones\") are acceptable and do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The content remains concise while keeping the full meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and remains readable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic improvements—especially replacing \"afinación\" with a more common term for fine‑tuning and smoothing a few awkward phrases—could raise the fluency score, but the work is solid and faithful to the original."
