  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas and the flow of the podcast dialogue is preserved. A few constructions are slightly stilted (e.g., \"El preentrenamiento\" as an isolated line, or \"Más bien, no enseñarías\" instead of a more natural \"Más bien, no le enseñarías\"), but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several literal renderings make the text feel a bit robotic. Phrases such as \"Más bien, no enseñarías\" and \"El aprendizaje en contexto es un repaso intensivo\" are understandable yet not the most idiomatic Spanish. Vocabulary is appropriate, but occasional awkward word order reduces overall smoothness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly and consistently: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", and the parenthetical \"grounding\" rendered as \"anclaje\". The translator kept the specialized terms recognizable for a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose of the podcast. Cultural references are minimal in the source, so no major adaptation was required. Minor phrasing choices could be more idiomatic for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but the overall message remains intact.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant information has been omitted or altered, and the logical progression of concepts (pre‑training → fine‑tuning → transfer learning → in‑context learning → memory tricks) is fully retained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is faithful and conveys the technical content accurately. Readability and terminology are strong points, while fluency could be polished to sound more natural in Spanish. Minor stylistic adjustments would raise the overall quality, but the current version is already quite solid for its intended audience.\nOverall score (out of 100): 86/100."
