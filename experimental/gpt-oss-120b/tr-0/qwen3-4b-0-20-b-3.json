  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated dialogue is largely understandable and follows the original structure, but several grammatical slips (e.g., “Las conocimientos”, “a la vuela”, missing verb agreement) disrupt the flow. Some sentences are long and could be broken for better clarity, which slightly hampers comprehension for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains a number of unnatural expressions and occasional incorrect conjugations (“solo le proporcionarle”, “aprender a la vuela”). Nevertheless, most of the language is idiomatic and the conversation feels natural overall, just not fully polished as a native‑level script would be.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally handled well: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL*, *grounding* (rendered as “anclaje”). The translation keeps English abbreviations and the core concepts intact, showing consistency and appropriate explanation where needed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation stays very literal, preserving the original tone, but it misses some cultural/idiomatic adaptation. Errors like “aprender a la vuela” instead of a proper Spanish idiom reduce the natural fit for the target audience. Overall intent is kept, but adaptation could be smoother.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the points from the original script are present; no major ideas or examples are omitted. The translator even adds clarifying parentheticals (e.g., “(Aprendizaje en contexto)”). The content is complete and faithful to the source.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the full content of the original French podcast and handles the technical vocabulary adequately. However, it suffers from a number of grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that affect readability and fluency. Minor refinements—especially correcting gender agreement, verb forms, and idiomatic expressions—would bring the text to a native‑speaker quality level. As it stands, the translation is functional but not polished.\nOverall score (out of 100): 74/100."
