  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear order. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto are explained with simple analogías that a non‑expert audience can follow. Minor typographical quirks (e.g., extra spaces before «olvidado») do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are a few inconsistencies: a mix of formal \"usted\" and informal \"tú\" (\"Cuando abres una nueva ventana\" vs \"Los conocimientos que usted proporciona\"), and a couple of slightly stiff constructions (\"por qué puede convertirse\" instead of \"por lo que puede convertirse\", \"el modelo mismo no aprende\"). These issues prevent a perfect native‑like fluency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje (grounding). The English word \"prompt\" is left untranslated, which is acceptable in a tech‑focused audience, and the use of parentheses for the original English terms is consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French to Spanish culture and usage well. The analogies (consultor, estudiante, bicicleta) are preserved and make sense for Spanish speakers. The only drawback is the occasional shift between formal and informal registers, which slightly reduces cultural consistency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original script is retained. No sentences or ideas are omitted, and no extraneous material is added. The translation faithfully conveys the full content of the podcast dialogue.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the original message clearly. It handles technical terminology appropriately and maintains the educational tone of the podcast. Minor issues with register consistency and a few awkward phrasings keep it from being flawless, but overall it is a high‑quality Spanish version of the French script.\n\nScore out of 20: 18 (average of the five criteria). The translation is very good, with only small stylistic imperfections.\n\nOverall score (average): 18"
