  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure, but there are several grammatical slips (e.g., \"bienvenido en\" instead of \"bienvenido a\", \"Apena aprende\" instead of \"Apenas aprende\") and occasional clumsy phrasing that slightly disrupt the flow. The concepts are explained clearly, but the occasional errors reduce smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural expressions for native speakers: mixed formal‑informal register (\"Usted ha entendido todo\" vs the informal tone of the podcast), awkward literal translations (\"bachear\" for \"cramming\", \"el afinado\" for \"fine‑tuning\"), and some word order issues. Despite this, a native reader can follow the dialogue, but it does not sound completely natural.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" rendered as \"anclaje\". The only notable inconsistency is the translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"el afinado\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\". Overall, terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and explanatory style. Cultural adaptation is adequate, but the shift between formal \"usted\" and informal podcast speech creates a slight mismatch. The slang \"bachear\" may not be universally understood, though it conveys the intended meaning. Overall, the context is well conveyed.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present; no sections are omitted or significantly altered. Minor typographical errors do not remove meaning. The translation maintains the same level of detail and examples.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the technical content and overall message of the original podcast very well. Terminology is mostly accurate and the concepts are clearly presented. However, the text suffers from several grammatical mistakes, inconsistent register, and occasional awkward phrasing, which affect readability and fluency. With a few stylistic revisions (e.g., using \"ajuste fino\" instead of \"afinado\", aligning the register to a consistent informal tone, fixing minor errors), the translation would reach a higher level of naturalness.\nOverall rating: B+ (78/100)."
