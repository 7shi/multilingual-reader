  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version presents the concepts in a clear, logical order. Sentences are generally short enough to follow, and explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are kept simple. A few sentences are a bit long (e.g., the one about “espacio de trabajo temporal”), but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part and uses appropriate everyday vocabulary. There are occasional slightly stiff choices – for instance \"el afinado\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\" or \"fine‑tuning\" – and a couple of constructions that feel a bit literal (\"el aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\"). Overall, a native speaker would find it comfortable.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, grounding → \"anclaje\", etc. Where the original kept the French/English term (e.g., \"afinado\"), the Spanish equivalent is still understandable, and the translation stays consistent throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue, adapting cultural references appropriately (e.g., using \"consultor brillante\" instead of \"consultant\"). No French idioms were left untranslated, and the examples (e.g., bicycle analogy) work well for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and no redundant material is added. The nuanced distinction between temporary knowledge (ICL) and permanent skill (fine‑tuning) is fully retained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains largely natural and easy to read, and respects the original conversational style. Minor stylistic tweaks (e.g., using \"ajuste fino\") could make it sound a little more idiomatic, but they do not detract from overall clarity or correctness.\nOverall score (out of 100): 89/100."
