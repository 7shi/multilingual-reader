  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained clearly. A few minor phrasing choices are slightly literal, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Most vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic. Small awkwardnesses appear (e.g., \"Lo has entendido todo\", \"partes de un contexto vacío\") which feel a bit literal, but overall the flow is smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)*, *anclaje (grounding)*, etc. The English acronyms are kept with Spanish explanations, which is consistent and helpful for the target audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects Spanish‑speaking listeners, using familiar expressions and adapting cultural references where needed. The tone remains conversational and matches the podcast format. Minor literal renderings could be refined, but the intent and purpose are fully conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and no unnecessary repetitions are introduced. The supplemental explanations (e.g., analogies) are kept intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It faithfully transmits the original content, keeps the technical terminology accurate, and is largely readable and natural for Spanish listeners. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but they do not affect the clarity or correctness of the message.\nScore: 18/20 (average of the five criteria)."
