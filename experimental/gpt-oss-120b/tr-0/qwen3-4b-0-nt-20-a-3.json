    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure. However, there are several grammatical slips (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en”, “Apena aprende”, missing accents) that force the reader to pause. The flow of ideas is preserved, but occasional awkward phrasing slightly hampers smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many expressions sound unnatural to a native speaker: “¡Hola y bienvenido en”, “desempolvar la manera”, “se volvieron tan inteligentes”, “babilar para un examen”. There are also typographical errors and inconsistent punctuation. While the meaning is clear, the translation does not read as fluid, native‑speaker Spanish.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly translated correctly: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje (grounding). The occasional retention of English words like “prompt” is acceptable in this context. No major mistranslations of concepts are found.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The podcast tone and explanatory style are kept, and cultural references are appropriate. Nevertheless, some phrasing (“¡Hola y bienvenido en”, “consultor brillante”) could be refined for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The intent of the original is conveyed, but a few idiomatic adjustments are needed.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original script is present; no ideas or sections are omitted. Minor typographical errors do not cause loss of meaning, and the translation remains faithful to the source content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully transmits the technical content and overall structure of the podcast, and the terminology is well handled. However, noticeable grammatical mistakes and unnatural expressions reduce readability and fluency. A thorough proofreading and some idiomatic polishing would bring the text to a native‑speaker quality level.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
