    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences are clear, and the technical concepts are explained in an understandable way. There are a few awkward phrasings such as \"apuntando a la víspera\" for \"bachotage\" and the opening \"Hola y bienvenido en\" which slightly hinder smooth comprehension, but they do not prevent the reader from grasping the content.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly natural, but there are several spots where the wording feels forced or unidiomatic: \"Hola y bienvenido en\" (should be \"a\"), the mixed use of \"Usted\" and informal forms, and the literal translation of \"bachoter\" as \"apuntando a la víspera\" which is not a common expression in Spanish. Overall, the flow is good but these hiccups reduce the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento (fine‑tuning)\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje (grounding)\" etc. The translator kept the original English terms where appropriate and used consistent Spanish equivalents, which helps the target audience follow the discussion without confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and purpose of the podcast script. Cultural references are not required, and the speaker dynamics are kept. Minor issues such as the formal \"Usted\" appearing only once and some non‑idiomatic expressions slightly affect the adaptation, but the overall message is conveyed accurately.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and memory features is complete. The only loss is a tiny nuance in the sentence about constant fine‑tuning (\"no se afinan\" vs \"no se afina\"), which does not change the meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. It succeeds in keeping the structure and the educational tone of the original podcast. The main areas for improvement are polishing the language to sound more idiomatic (especially the opening greeting, the \"bachoter\" translation, and consistency of pronoun register) and fixing minor grammatical slips. With those tweaks, the text would feel completely natural to a native Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\nOverall score (average): 17/20."
