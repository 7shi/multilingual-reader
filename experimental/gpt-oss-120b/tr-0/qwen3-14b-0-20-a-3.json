    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the dialogue clearly and the flow of ideas is easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are understandable. Minor hiccups (e.g., the slightly awkward phrasing “el afinamiento” instead of a more common “ajuste fino”) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the text sounds natural, but there are several lexical choices that feel odd to a native speaker: “ancoraje” for grounding (the usual term is “anclaje”), “bacotaje” for bachotage, “bachotar” for the French verb, and occasional punctuation issues (extra space before ‘!’). These reduce the fluidity, although the informal podcast tone is largely preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: preentrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, ventana de contexto, ICL, fine‑tuning rendered consistently as “afinamiento”. The only notable deviation is “ancoraje”, which is less common but still understandable. The use of the English word “prompt” is acceptable in a technical context.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent, keeps the conversational podcast style, and adapts cultural references (e.g., using “chuleta” for cheat‑sheet). The mix of formal/informal second‑person pronouns is acceptable in this informal setting. Minor grammatical slips (\"por haber nos escuchado\") are present but do not affect the overall adaptation.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of the “Memory” feature. No substantive content is omitted; only small phrasing errors appear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does an excellent job of preserving the original podcast’s explanatory flow and informal tone. Technical concepts are correctly rendered, and the majority of the content is transferred faithfully. A few lexical choices (ancoraje, bacotaje, bachotar) and minor grammatical errors detract slightly from naturalness, but they do not impede understanding. With minor polishing of terminology and punctuation, the text would be fully native‑like. Overall, the translation is high‑quality and effectively communicates the original material to a Spanish‑speaking audience."
