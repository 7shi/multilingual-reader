  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clearly laid out. Most sentences preserve the logical flow of the original, and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are understandable. A few long sentences and the mistranslation of “anclaje” as “ancraje” slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural but contains several awkward or literal renderings: “nueva approach” should be “nuevo enfoque”, “memoria desechable” is not idiomatic, and occasional missing commas make the rhythm feel stilted. Nevertheless, a native Spanish speaker can comprehend it without effort.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is largely handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje de transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, etc. The only notable lapse is the translation of “grounding” as “ancraje” instead of the proper “anclaje”. Consistency is otherwise good.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish well, using appropriate equivalents (consultor brillante, proyecto, etc.). Cultural references are preserved, and the explanation fits a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor literal translations (e.g., “artimaña”) do not break comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is retained. No sections are omitted, and the nuances about temporary vs. permanent knowledge, memory features, and the consultant vs. expert analogy are fully conveyed.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is solid and conveys the original content accurately. Strengths include faithful rendering of technical concepts and maintaining the conversational podcast style. Weaknesses are a few unnatural phrasing choices and a mis‑translation of the term “grounding”. With minor polishing, the text would read as completely native. The translation scores well on completeness and contextual adaptation, but loses points on fluency and terminology due to the noted errors.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
