  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor hiccups such as \"una IA totalmente nueva a la escuela\" instead of \"en la escuela\" do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, but a few awkward phrasings (e.g., \"estudiar a última hora\", \"una IA totalmente nueva a la escuela\", retaining the French word \"ancrage\") slightly reduce the flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" are appropriate. The only drawback is the untranslated French term \"ancrage\" which could have been rendered as \"anclaje\".",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent, tone, and educational style. Cultural adaptation is adequate; the use of \"consultor brillante\" fits Spanish‑speaking audiences. Retaining the French podcast name is acceptable. The leftover French word \"ancrage\" is the only minor lapse.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present. No ideas are omitted, and no redundant material is added. The meaning of each segment is preserved.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is strong. It faithfully renders the technical discussion, keeps the conversational tone, and is largely clear and natural. Minor stylistic issues (a few awkward phrases and an untranslated French term) prevent it from being perfect, but they do not impair understanding.\n\nTotal score: 88/100, indicating a high‑quality translation with room for slight polishing.\n\nScore out of 100: 88"
