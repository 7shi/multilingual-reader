  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the sentences are logically ordered. Complex ideas such as transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained clearly. Minor hiccups (e.g., a slightly clunky phrasing of “el aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje”) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic, and the dialogue flows well. A few literal renderings (e.g., “el aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje” and occasional retention of English terms like “prompt”) feel a bit stiff, but they are understandable.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, transferencia de aprendizaje, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, etc. The acronyms are kept, which is standard for a tech‑savvy audience. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts cultural references (e.g., “consultor brillante”). The tone remains conversational and suitable for a podcast audience. Slight literalness in a couple of spots does not affect the overall message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is lost, and the explanation of memory‑like features is fully retained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, reads smoothly for a Spanish‑speaking audience, and maintains the original conversational tone. Minor lexical choices prevent a perfect score, but they do not detract from the clarity or correctness of the information presented.\n\nStrengths: precise handling of technical terms, faithful conveyance of the original dialogue, good readability.\nAreas for improvement: smoother rendering of a few literal phrases and occasional translation of English loanwords like “prompt”.\n\nThe translation would be readily understood by listeners of a tech podcast in Spanish and serves its purpose well.\n\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 92/100."
