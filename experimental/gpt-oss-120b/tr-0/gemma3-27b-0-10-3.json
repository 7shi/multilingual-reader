  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and the ideas flow logically. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the technical concepts are explained in an accessible way. A few long sentences could be split for easier reading, but overall a French‑speaking audience would understand without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places. Minor awkwardness appears (e.g., “entre bastidores” instead of a more common “detrás de escena”, retention of English words like “prompt” and “grounding”). These do not break comprehension but slightly reduce native‑speaker smoothness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje. Consistency is maintained, and the occasional English loan (prompt, grounding) is acceptable in a tech context. No major mistranslations.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are neutral, and examples (consultor brillante, bicicleta) work well for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present. No information is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The nuance about memory features is retained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and keeps the conversational style of the podcast. Minor fluency issues and occasional English borrowings prevent a perfect score, but the text is perfectly usable for a Spanish‑language audience interested in AI concepts.\nScore: 19/20"
