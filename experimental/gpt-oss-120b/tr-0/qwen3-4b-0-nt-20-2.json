  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally understandable and follows the original flow, but there are several typographical and grammatical errors (e.g., “bachear”, “las conocencias”, “Usted ha entendido todo”) that slightly disrupt comprehension. The sentence structure is mostly logical, so a reader can follow the discussion, albeit with minor hiccups.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Some expressions sound unnatural for native Spanish speakers. The use of the formal “Usted” in a conversational podcast, the odd phrasing “El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje”, and the incorrect verb “bachear” reduce fluency. Overall the text is readable but not as smooth as a native script would be.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: “preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “anclaje”, etc. The only minor point is the choice of “afinado” for fine‑tuning, which is acceptable but less common than “ajuste fino”.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and purpose accurately. Cultural adaptation is adequate, though the persistent formal register (“Usted”) feels out of place for a podcast and some colloquial nuances are missed. Nonetheless, the message is preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is retained. No significant ideas are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original. Minor typographical errors do not affect the factual content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation successfully transmits the technical content and overall narrative of the original podcast. It is largely complete and technically accurate, but suffers from several linguistic slips and a slightly formal tone that make it feel less natural for a spoken podcast format. Addressing the typographical errors and adjusting the register would markedly improve readability and fluency.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 16/20."
