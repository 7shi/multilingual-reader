  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation conveys the original ideas clearly and follows a logical flow. Sentences are slightly long but remain comprehensible. Technical explanations are kept simple enough for a general audience. Minor issues such as occasional lack of articles (e.g., “preentrenamiento” instead of “el preentrenamiento”) do not hinder understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the text reads naturally for a native Spanish speaker. Word choices like “desciframos”, “consultor brillante” and “vacío su espacio de trabajo temporal” are idiomatic. The main awkwardness is the mixed‑language term “AIC (Aprendizaje In‑Contexto)”, which feels forced; a more natural rendering would be “aprendizaje en contexto”. This prevents a perfect fluency rating.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: pre‑entrenamiento → preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning → ajuste fino, transfer learning → aprendizaje por transferencia, grounding → anclaje, etc. The occasional retention of English abbreviations (AIC) is acceptable given the context, and the Spanish equivalents are provided. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., “consultor brillante” instead of “consultant”). The tone remains conversational and matches the podcast format. No cultural mismatches are present, and the original intent is fully preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No sentences are omitted, and the nuances (such as the distinction between temporary knowledge and permanent skill) are retained. The translation is concise without unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It accurately transmits the technical content and conversational tone of the original podcast, with only minor fluency hiccups related to mixed‑language abbreviations. Readability and terminology are strong, and no information is lost. Overall, it would serve Spanish‑speaking listeners very well, requiring only a small polish on the AIC label to achieve full naturalness.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
