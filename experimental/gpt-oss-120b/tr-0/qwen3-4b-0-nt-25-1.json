  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but there are several grammatical slips and awkward phrasings (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en”, “Usted ha entendido todo”, “La conocimientos”). These do not block comprehension but slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many literal renderings that sound unnatural to native speakers. Mix of formal ‘usted’ and informal tone, misuse of articles, and the leftover French word “antisèche” break the natural flow. The overall fluency is moderate.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “afinado”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “ventana de contexto”, “grounding” are correctly translated. However, the word “prompt” is left in English without explanation, and the French word “antisèche” appears untranslated, which reduces consistency.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent but does not fully adapt the register to Spanish‑speaking podcast listeners. It oscillates between formal and informal address and retains some French cultural references, limiting cultural resonance.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the ideas, examples, and explanations from the French script are present. No major content is omitted, and the logical sequence is preserved, despite minor typographical errors.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core message and technical content accurately, but it suffers from noticeable fluency and readability issues due to literal phrasing, inconsistent register, and a few untranslated French terms. Terminology is mostly handled well, and the information is complete, yet a native‑speaker edit would be needed to achieve a natural, polished Spanish podcast script.\nOverall score (out of 100): 70/100.\nStrengths: faithful to the source, retains technical explanations, complete coverage.\nWeaknesses: grammatical inaccuracies, awkward style, mixed formality, occasional foreign terms left untranslated.\nRecommendation: revise for consistent tone, correct grammar, replace “antisèche” with a Spanish equivalent (e.g., “chuleta” or “apuntes”), and ensure all English/French terms are either explained or fully translated."
