  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the ideas clearly and maintains a logical flow. The explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning are understandable for a non‑expert audience. Minor gender‑agreement errors (e.g., *las conocimientos*) do not significantly hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the Spanish reads naturally, but there are a few awkward constructions and grammatical slips: *las informaciones*, *las conocimientos*, and the informal *chuleta* (which is acceptable in some regions but may feel out‑of‑place in a formal podcast script). These issues slightly reduce the smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: *preentrenamiento*, *afinado* (fine‑tuning), *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *anclaje*. The translation stays consistent and, where necessary, adds parenthetical explanations (e.g., “grounding”).",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the content well to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the tone matches a podcast format. The only slight mismatch is the use of *chuleta*, which is colloquial but still understandable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present. No ideas are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The essential distinctions between temporary (ICL) and permanent (fine‑tuning) knowledge are preserved.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and faithfully reproduces the original French content. It is easy to follow and technically accurate, though a few grammatical slips and occasional colloquial wording keep it from being flawless. With minor proofreading, it would be ready for publication.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.2 → 18/20."
