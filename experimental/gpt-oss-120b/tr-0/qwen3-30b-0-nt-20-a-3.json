  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas and technical concepts without major confusion. A few minor grammatical slips (e.g., \"partes de un contexto vacío\" instead of \"parte de un contexto vacío\") slightly affect flow but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, using appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic constructions. Some expressions are a little stiff or literal (e.g., \"memoria de uso único\" instead of the more idiomatic \"memoria de un solo uso\"; \"afinamiento\" is understandable but less common than \"ajuste fino\"). Overall, native speakers would find it smooth after a quick read.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\" (though \"ajuste fino\" could be preferable), \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\", etc. The translation explains transfer learning and ICL adequately, keeping the specialized language accessible for the intended audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural references are neutral, and the podcast name remains unchanged, which is appropriate. Minor wording choices could be more idiomatic, but the overall adaptation is faithful and suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted, and the explanatory parts are retained. The only tiny loss is the nuance of \"memoria a corto plazo\" versus \"memoria de uso único\", which is still conveyed.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, conveying the technical discussion clearly and accurately. Minor grammatical and stylistic issues prevent a perfect score, but they do not hinder understanding. The translator shows good grasp of both the subject matter and the target language.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17.6 → rounded to 18/20.\nOverall rating: 18/20."
