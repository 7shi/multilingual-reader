    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the original structure. Most sentences are clear, but a few awkward phrases (e.g., \"el bacho\" for \"bachotage\") and occasional punctuation issues slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are notable unnatural expressions such as \"es del bacho\" and inconsistent handling of English terms (prompt, fine‑tuning). These break the flow for a native speaker.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well‑handled: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding, etc. The use of the original English words (fine‑tuning, prompt) is acceptable, but the mistranslation of \"bachotage\" to \"bacho\" shows a lapse.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone, and the cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, the erroneous phrase \"es del bacho\" and some punctuation choices reduce the effectiveness of the adaptation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the content remains faithful to the original script.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation conveys the original message accurately and retains the technical depth of the podcast. The main shortcomings are a few awkward or incorrect expressions (notably \"es del bacho\") and occasional fluency hiccups that make the text feel slightly stilted. Terminology is largely appropriate, and the content is complete, but polishing the language would improve readability and naturalness.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 14/20, Fluency 13/20, Terminology 15/20, Contextual Adaptation 14/20, Information Completeness 18/20. Total: 74/100.\n\nRecommendations: replace \"es del bacho\" with a proper translation such as \"es un aprendizaje superficial\"; smooth punctuation; consider translating or italicising retained English terms consistently; verify consistency of accent marks (e.g., \"¡Una analogía perfecta!\" without space before the exclamation mark)."
