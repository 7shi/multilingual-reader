    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the concepts are explained in a way that a native Spanish speaker can understand. Minor issues such as the inconsistent naming of the podcast («Tech Éclair» vs «Tecno Relámpago») and occasional missing accents do not seriously impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, using appropriate idioms (e.g., “empollarse”). A few phrases are slightly awkward – for instance, “resumen o apunte (o *trampa* en el sentido de información previa)” and the sudden switch of the podcast name. Overall, the flow is smooth and the language is contemporary.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, ventana de contexto, anclaje, etc. The term “grounding” is explained as “anclaje”, which is consistent. The occasional retention of English words like “prompt” is acceptable in a technical context. No major terminological errors.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original content well to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using local expressions such as “empollarse”. The main drawback is the inconsistent handling of the podcast title, which may cause slight confusion. Apart from that, cultural references are appropriate.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the ideas, examples, and analogies from the French original are preserved. No significant information is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary material. The core message about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning remains intact.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality, conveying the technical content accurately and in a readable, mostly natural Spanish. Minor inconsistencies (especially the podcast name) and a few awkward phrasings keep it from being perfect, but overall it delivers the original intent effectively.\nScore out of 20: 17/20."
