  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas without major ambiguity. A few long sentences could be broken up for smoother reading, but overall a French‑speaking audience would understand the concepts without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most of the script. Minor awkward constructions appear (e.g., \"el aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje\", \"una memoria de uso único\"), and punctuation sometimes feels French‑influenced. Nevertheless, native speakers would not be confused and the flow is generally smooth.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding, etc. The translator kept the English acronyms where appropriate and used consistent Spanish equivalents throughout. No key term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts cultural references well. Phrases such as \"bachotaje\" for cramming and \"chuleta\" for cheat‑sheet are spot‑on for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The tone of a podcast dialogue is maintained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No sentences or concepts are omitted, and the added clarifications (e.g., \"entre bastidores\") help comprehension without altering meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, uses appropriate Spanish terminology, and retains the conversational tone of the original podcast. Minor fluency hiccups prevent a perfect score, but the text is fully understandable and faithful to the source.\n\nStrengths: precise handling of technical jargon, good cultural adaptation, completeness. Areas for improvement: smoother sentence segmentation and eliminating a few literal‑translation artifacts.\n\nFinal rating: 89/100.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 17, Fluency 16, Terminology 18, Contextual Adaptation 18, Information Completeness 20.\n\nRecommendation: A light copy‑edit focusing on flow and punctuation would bring the translation to near‑native perfection."
