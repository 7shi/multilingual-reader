    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained clearly with appropriate analogies. Sentences are of moderate length and easy to follow. A few minor phrasing choices (e.g., \"no tiene «olvidado»\") are slightly awkward but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural to a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. The only notable hiccups are the introduction of the abbreviation \"AIC\" (instead of the more common ICL) and occasional literal constructions that feel a bit stilted (e.g., \"no tiene «olvidado»\" instead of \"no ha 'olvidado'\"). These do not break fluency but are noticeable.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding → anclaje, etc. Consistency is maintained throughout. The only slight inconsistency is the abbreviation change (ICL → AIC), which could confuse readers familiar with the original term.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts expressions to Spanish‑speaking audiences (e.g., \"consultor brillante\" for \"consultant brilliant\"). Cultural references are kept neutral and the tone of a podcast script is preserved. Minor stylistic choices (like using « » quotes) keep the feel of the original.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is conveyed; no major ideas are omitted. The explanation of memory features, the distinction between ICL and fine‑tuning, and the analogy of a consultant are all present. The only tiny loss is the nuance of the abbreviation change, which does not affect the factual content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, delivering the technical content clearly and in a style appropriate for a podcast audience. It preserves the original explanations, analogies, and flow, with only minor issues concerning the ICL/AIC abbreviation and a few slightly unnatural phrasing choices. Overall, it would be well‑received by Spanish‑speaking listeners and serves as an accurate, readable rendition of the original French script."
