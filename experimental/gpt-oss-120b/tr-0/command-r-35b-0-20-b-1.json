  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logical and the technical concepts are explained clearly. Minor issues such as missing accent in \"¿Por qué...\" and a small agreement error (\"partes\" instead of \"parte\") do not significantly hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, but a few expressions feel slightly awkward (e.g., \"Miren esto\", \"El afinado\", \"Cuando abre una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío\"). These do not break the flow but prevent a completely native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "All technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, afinado/fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje (grounding). The terminology is consistent throughout and appropriate for a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original podcast tone, adapts greetings and cultural references appropriately, and keeps the explanatory style suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. A very slight loss of the colloquial nuance of \"bachotage\" (translated as \"estudio de memoria\") keeps the meaning but could have been rendered more idiomatically.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No information from the original script is omitted. All examples, analogies, and explanations are present, and no redundant or extraneous material was added.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the original content accurately, uses appropriate technical vocabulary, and is largely readable and natural for Spanish speakers. Minor grammatical slips and a few slightly stilted phrases keep it just short of perfection, but the meaning and intent are fully preserved. The work would require only minimal proofreading to reach an excellent level.\n"
