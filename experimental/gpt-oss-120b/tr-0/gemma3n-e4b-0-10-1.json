  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original French script. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in simple language that a non‑expert listener can understand. A few minor hiccups (e.g., \"Y soy Luc\" instead of \"Yo soy Luc\", occasional shift between \"tú\" and \"usted\") do not break comprehension, but they slightly reduce smoothness for the reader.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation reads naturally, using idiomatic Spanish vocabulary (\"ventana de contexto\", \"memoria a corto plazo\", \"consultor brillante\"). Some sentences feel a bit forced or contain small grammatical slips: \"una forma astucia\" (should be \"una forma astuta\"), \"Usted ha entendido todo\" mixed with later informal \"comienzas\", and the missing \"Yo\" in the opening line. These issues prevent a perfect native‑like fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently and correctly. \"Pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are all rendered with appropriate Spanish equivalents. The translation keeps the English acronyms (ICL) where needed, matching the source. No important term is mistranslated or omitted.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using familiar phrasing and cultural references (e.g., \"consultor brillante\"). The intent of the original dialogue – explaining the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge – is fully preserved. Minor register inconsistencies (formal vs. informal) slightly affect the overall adaptation, but the message remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No sentences or ideas are omitted, and the logical sequence of the discussion is maintained. The only noticeable omission is the pronoun \"Yo\" in the opening line, which does not affect the conveyed information. Redundancies are minimal and the text stays concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality: it conveys the technical content accurately, uses appropriate terminology, and remains largely easy to understand. Minor linguistic slips—missing pronoun, occasional register shifts, and a couple of awkward word choices—prevent it from being flawless, but they do not hinder comprehension. With a brief proofread to fix these small issues, the translation would reach near‑perfect native fluency.\n\nOverall score (average): 18.4/20."
