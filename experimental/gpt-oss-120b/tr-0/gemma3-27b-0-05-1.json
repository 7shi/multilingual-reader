  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the complex ideas about pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can understand. Minor issues such as slightly long sentences do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and the informal podcast tone is preserved (e.g., ¡Exactamente!, ¡Una analogía perfecta!). A few literal constructions (“ventana de contexto” entre comillas, “una IA completamente nueva”) sound a bit stilted, but they do not break fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “anclaje (grounding)”. The acronyms are kept, and the translation is consistent throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and the podcast’s conversational style. Cultural references are neutral, and the Spanish version adapts expressions (e.g., “consultor brillante”) suitably for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is retained. No significant content is omitted, and the nuances about temporary vs permanent knowledge are preserved.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately while keeping the lively, informal tone of the original podcast. Minor lexical choices could be refined for a slightly smoother reading experience, but the text is clear, faithful, and natural for Spanish listeners.\nScore: 91/100."
