  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow; sentences are generally clear and the flow mirrors the original dialogue. The concepts are explained in a straightforward way. Minor issues such as the use of French guillemets (« »), which are uncommon in Spanish, do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few expressions feel overly literal (“memoria a corto plazo”, “la IA no ha « olvidado »”) and the repeated use of « ¡Exactamente! » is a direct carry‑over from French. These quirks make the text sound slightly stilted for a native speaker.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *afinamiento* (although *ajuste fino* is more common), *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)*, *anclaje (grounding)*, etc. The terminology is consistent throughout the script and appropriate for a general‑audience podcast.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts it to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Cultural references are preserved, and the informal podcast tone is maintained. The only slight mismatch is the retention of French quotation marks, which feels out of place culturally.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and no unnecessary repetitions are added. The translation faithfully conveys the complete dialogue and technical explanations.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content clearly, uses appropriate terminology, and retains the conversational style of the podcast. A few lexical choices and typographic conventions could be refined to sound more native, but they do not detract significantly from understanding.\nThe translation scores well across all criteria, yielding an average of about 18/20, which reflects a strong, professional rendering with minor room for improvement in fluency and stylistic adaptation.\n\nScore: 18/20"
