    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and the flow of ideas follows the original. However, there are several grammatical slips (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en…”, “Apena aprende…”, “cuando usted afinan un modelo”) and occasional awkward phrasing that can momentarily confuse the reader. These issues lower the ease of reading but do not prevent comprehension of the main points.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many non‑native constructions and lexical errors (\"babilar\" instead of \"bachotear\", \"Apena\" instead of \"Apenas\", “bienvenido en” instead of “bienvenido al”). Vocabulary choices are sometimes literal rather than idiomatic, making the text feel stilted. Consequently, the overall naturalness is limited.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally handled well: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, anclaje, ventana de contexto are all correctly rendered. The translator kept some English acronyms where appropriate and provided explanations consistent with the original. Minor inconsistencies (e.g., occasional missing accents) do not affect the technical meaning.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the podcast script are preserved, and the examples (consultor brillante, proyecto, conversación) are adapted sensibly for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Some phrasing choices are slightly off culturally (\"¡Hola y bienvenido en…\"), but overall the adaptation conveys the original purpose.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the main ideas, analogies, and examples from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No substantial information is omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue. Minor typographical errors do not result in loss of content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in transmitting the full technical content of the original podcast script and uses appropriate terminology. Nevertheless, frequent grammatical mistakes and unnatural expressions reduce readability and fluency, making the text feel less polished than a native‑level production. A thorough copy‑edit focusing on syntax, gender agreement, and idiomatic phrasing would raise the quality substantially."
