  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Most sentences convey the original ideas without excessive complexity. A few minor issues (e.g., isolated “El preentrenamiento.”, occasional punctuation quirks) slightly affect flow, but overall a Spanish‑speaking listener can understand the podcast script without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, using appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic constructions. Some phrasing feels a bit literal (“para darle una cultura general”, “El afinado”) and there are small typographical errors (missing accent in \"masiva\"). These do not break comprehension but prevent the text from being perfectly smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinado\" (common translation of fine‑tuning), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\" and \"anclaje\" for grounding are used consistently. The word \"prompt\" is left untranslated, which is acceptable for the target audience. No major terminology errors are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts the style to a Spanish‑language podcast audience. The analogies (consultor brillante, repasar para un examen) work well culturally. Minor adjustments could make the tone slightly more conversational, but the overall adaptation is successful.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is retained. No sentences or concepts are omitted, and the technical explanations remain intact. Only trivial punctuation differences are observed, which do not affect content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and faithful to the original script. Technical concepts are correctly rendered, and the overall message is preserved. Minor fluency and readability hiccups (some literal phrasing, small typographical issues) keep it from being perfect, but the text is fully understandable and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience.\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 88/100.\nRecommendations: smooth out a few literal translations (e.g., \"para darle una cultura general\" → \"para dotarla de cultura general\"), correct minor typographical errors, and consider using \"ajuste fino\" instead of \"afinado\" if a more common term is desired."
