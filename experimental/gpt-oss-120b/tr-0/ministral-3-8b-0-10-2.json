  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the flow of ideas mirrors the original French dialogue. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained clearly. A few minor issues (e.g., occasional use of the plural \"informaciones\" instead of the more natural singular \"información\") do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural to a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and most idiomatic expressions are well chosen. There are a handful of awkward phrasings – for example, \"una nueva aproximación más flexible\" (a bit stilted) and the retention of the French word \"antisèche\" in parentheses, which feels out of place. Overall, the text reads smoothly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled expertly. Key terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly translated and used consistently. The occasional retention of English acronyms (ICL, prompt) is acceptable for the target audience. The translation maintains a coherent terminology set throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the content well to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using familiar phrasing and culturally neutral examples. The only drawback is the occasional insertion of French or English words (e.g., \"antisèche\", \"Memoria\" capitalised) that could be replaced by Spanish equivalents for smoother cultural adaptation. Nonetheless, the original intent and tone are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French script is retained. No significant ideas are omitted, and the logical order of the discussion is preserved. Minor redundancies appear (e.g., repeating the notion of “memoria de uso único”), but they do not affect the completeness of the translation.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, this is a high‑quality translation. It conveys the technical content accurately, uses appropriate terminology, and remains comprehensible for Spanish listeners. Minor stylistic glitches and the occasional foreign term prevent a perfect score, but the translation is effective and faithful to the original podcast script.\n\n**Overall score:** 17/20"
