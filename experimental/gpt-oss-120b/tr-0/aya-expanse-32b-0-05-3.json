    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow; sentences are generally clear and the concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. There are a few very long sentences that could be split for smoother reading, and the parenthetical expansion of ICL as “Lenguaje de Comprensión e Generación” adds a bit of confusion, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary and idiomatic expressions such as “consultor brillante”, “ventana de contexto” and “espacio de trabajo temporal” are appropriate. Minor awkwardness appears in repetitions (e.g., “aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”) and in the slightly formal phrasing of some clauses, but native speakers would not find it jarring.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”. The only notable issue is the inaccurate expansion of ICL as “Lenguaje de Comprensión e Generación”, which does not match the standard term and could mislead readers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast’s conversational tone and adapts cultural references appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The analogy of a consultant and the explanation of “memoria” features feel natural in the target culture. The intent and purpose of the original dialogue are fully conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the added parenthetical explanations do not remove any content. Redundancy is minimal, keeping the transcript concise yet complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It delivers the technical content clearly and maintains the informal, educational style of the podcast. The main weaknesses are a small inaccuracy in the definition of the ICL acronym and a few slightly cumbersome sentence constructions. These issues do not substantially affect understanding, so the translation can be considered very good with room for minor polishing."
