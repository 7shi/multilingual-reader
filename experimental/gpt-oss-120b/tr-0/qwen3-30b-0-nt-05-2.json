  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and the concepts are clearly explained. Sentence structures are logical, though occasional long sentences and the use of “pre‑entrenamiento” vs. “preentrenamiento” create slight hiccups. Overall a reader can understand the discussion without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward expressions such as “el afinado” for fine‑tuning, missing opening question marks, and occasional over‑literal renderings. Vocabulary is appropriate, yet some phrasing could be smoother for native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms like \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"grounding\" (rendered as \"anclaje\") are correctly translated. The only minor issue is the translation of fine‑tuning as “el afinado”, which is understandable but not the most common Spanish term.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts idioms (e.g., “consultor brillante”) appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the overall tone matches the podcast style. Minor punctuation issues aside, the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is retained. No substantive content is omitted, and the translation does not introduce irrelevant material. The only loss is a missing opening question mark, which does not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast content accurately and comprehensively. It is readable and technically sound, though a few lexical choices (e.g., \"el afinado\") and punctuation errors prevent it from reaching full native fluency. Minor polishing would raise the overall quality, but the core message and technical explanations are well preserved.\nOverall score: 86/100."
