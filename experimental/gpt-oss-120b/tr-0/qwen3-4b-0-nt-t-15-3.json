    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. However, there are several grammatical slips (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en”, “la afinado”, “Apena aprende”, “conocencias”) that force the reader to pause. These errors reduce smooth comprehension but do not hide the meaning.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural or literal constructions that a native speaker would not use. Pronoun inconsistency (mix of “tú” and formal “usted”), the use of “el afinado” instead of “ajuste fino”, and awkward phrasing such as “El aprendizaje en contexto, es del tipo de ‘bachotage’” make the text sound stilted.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, grounding (anclaje). The choice of “afinado” for fine‑tuning is less common, and the French loan‑word “bachotage” is left untranslated without explanation, but overall the terminology is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sticks closely to the French source, resulting in literal expressions that feel foreign in Spanish (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en”, “El afinado…”). Cultural adaptation is limited; a more natural Spanish podcast introduction and consistent register would improve it.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and analogies from the original script are present. No substantial information is omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is retained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full content and technical ideas, but it suffers from grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and limited adaptation to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Technical terminology is largely correct, yet some word choices feel literal or uncommon. A thorough proofreading and stylistic revision would raise fluency and readability significantly."
