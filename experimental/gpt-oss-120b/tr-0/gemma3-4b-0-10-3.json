  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the dialogue format is preserved, making the flow clear. Complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) are explained with suitable examples. A few very long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most of the script. Vocabulary is appropriate and the informal podcast tone is kept. Minor issues appear, such as the hyphenated \"pre‑entrenamiento\" (more common is \"preentrenamiento\"), occasional slightly stiff phrasing (e.g., \"Mire, por ejemplo:\"), and the use of \"bachorear\" which, while understandable, is colloquial. Overall, a native speaker would find it fluid.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are all rendered consistently. The English term *prompt* is kept in italics, which is acceptable in a technical context. \"Grounding\" is translated as \"anclaje\" and the parenthetical clarification is provided, preserving meaning. No major terminology errors are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and the podcast’s conversational style. It uses informal \"tú\" consistently, which matches the casual French tone. Cultural references are neutral, so no loss of meaning occurs. A small point: the note about the Spanish‑speaking exclamation in the original is omitted, but it is a meta‑comment, not part of the content.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No sections are omitted, and the technical explanations remain intact. The only missing piece is the editorial note about the exclamation, which is not part of the dialogue itself. Therefore the content is virtually complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical concepts clearly, keeps the podcast’s lively tone, and uses appropriate Spanish terminology. Minor stylistic tweaks (e.g., smoothing long sentences, adjusting a couple of hyphenations) would raise fluency further, but the text is already very usable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI fundamentals. The overall score reflects a strong, professional translation with only small room for polish."
