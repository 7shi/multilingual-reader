  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the dialogue format is preserved, making the content comprehensible. However, there is a noticeable awkward sentence – «Camille: Es decir, en otras palabras, esto es, o bien, o sea» – which does not correspond to the original French «C’est‑à‑dire ?». This disrupts the flow and may confuse readers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural and the vocabulary is appropriate for a tech‑oriented podcast. Minor issues such as the aforementioned filler phrase and occasional literal translations (e.g., keeping *prompt* in English) make the text feel slightly stilted, but overall it reads smoothly for native speakers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered: «pre‑entrenamiento», «ajuste fino», «aprendizaje por transferencia», «aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)», «ventana de contexto», «anclaje (grounding)». The acronyms and English terms are kept consistently, which is standard in Spanish technical discourse.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the informal, conversational tone of a podcast and adapts cultural references appropriately. The only drawback is the odd filler phrase that feels out of place in Spanish, slightly weakening the adaptation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the technical explanations are retained.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical concepts clearly, preserving the podcast’s style. Minor awkward phrasing and a stray filler sentence prevent it from being perfect, but the terminology and completeness are strong. With a few stylistic tweaks the translation would be excellent for Spanish‑speaking audiences.\nScore breakdown: Readability 15, Fluency 16, Terminology 18, Contextual Adaptation 16, Information Completeness 19. Total: 84/100."
