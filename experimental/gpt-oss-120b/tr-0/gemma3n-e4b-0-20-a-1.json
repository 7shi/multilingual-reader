  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are generally short and the logical flow mirrors the original. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in clear language. A few minor issues (mix of \"tú\"/\"vosotros\" and occasional long sentences) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a podcast script, but there are some inconsistencies in pronoun use (\"Podéis\", \"vuestra\", \"tú\") and a few slightly awkward phrasing choices (e.g., \"Lo habéis entendido todo\", \"una libreta de apuntes\"). Overall, a native speaker would understand it easily, but a polished edit would improve smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\". The term \"prompt\" is kept in italics, which is appropriate. No mistranslations or inconsistent term usage were found.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal, conversational tone of the original French podcast and adapts idioms to Spanish (e.g., \"una libreta de apuntes\"). Cultural references are neutral, so no loss of meaning. Minor pronoun inconsistencies slightly affect the naturalness, but the intent is fully conveyed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No key ideas or examples are omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is maintained. The translation does not add unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality and conveys the technical content clearly. Terminology is spot‑on, and the overall meaning and tone are preserved. Minor stylistic tweaks—especially consistent pronoun usage and smoothing a few clunky phrases—would bring the fluency up to near‑perfect level. The work is ready for publication with a brief edit pass.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 91/100 (average of the five criteria)."
