  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the ideas clearly and the sentence flow is logical. Most sentences are easy to follow, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑specialist can understand. Minor issues (occasionally long sentences and a few punctuation quirks) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the text sounds natural to a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and most expressions are idiomatic. There are a few literal translations that feel slightly stiff (e.g., “ventana de contexto”, the repetitive “¡Exacto!” and occasional missing commas), but they do not break the flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “anclaje” and “ventana de contexto” are all correct and consistently used. The word “prompt” is left in English, which is acceptable in this context, and no important term is omitted or mistranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., “consultor brillante”). The style matches a podcast dialogue in Spanish and the explanations are tailored for a general audience. Small stylistic repetitions could be smoothed, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is retained. No key ideas or examples are lost, and the logical progression of the discussion is preserved. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy and remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate, clear and mostly fluent. It captures the technical content and the conversational tone of the podcast well. Minor literal renderings and punctuation inconsistencies prevent a perfect score, but the text is highly usable for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\nOverall rating (average of the five criteria): 17.4 ≈ 17/20.\nScore: 17"
