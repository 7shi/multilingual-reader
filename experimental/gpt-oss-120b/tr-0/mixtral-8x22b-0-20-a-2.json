  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. A few minor issues (e.g., the use of “pre‑entrenamiento” with a hyphen and occasional long sentences) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, but there are occasional awkward phrasings such as “una cantidad mucho menor de texto” and the retention of the French term “ancrage”. The abbreviation AIC (instead of the more common ICL) may feel a bit forced. Overall, a native speaker would understand it without effort.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “memoria a corto plazo”, etc. The translator kept some French jargon (“ancrage”) and introduced an unconventional Spanish acronym (AIC) for In‑Context Learning, which slightly reduces consistency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the podcast style and adapts cultural references appropriately. The only notable lapse is the retention of the French word “ancrage” instead of a Spanish equivalent (“anclaje”), which may feel out of place for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the ideas, examples, and analogies from the original French script are present. No significant information is omitted, and the added parenthetical explanations (e.g., “grounding”) help the reader. Redundancies are minimal.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does an excellent job conveying the original content, preserving the educational tone and technical depth. Minor lexical choices (untranslated French terms, a non‑standard abbreviation) prevent it from being flawless, but the text remains highly understandable and accurate.\nOverall rating: 18/20.\n\nStrengths: clear structure, faithful transmission of concepts, good handling of most technical vocabulary.\nAreas for improvement: replace lingering French terms with Spanish equivalents, standardize abbreviations, smooth a few slightly stilted phrases.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18.2 ≈ 18 out of 20."
