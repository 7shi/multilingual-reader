  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured, and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are presented in a way that a non‑expert listener can understand. A few long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, using idiomatic Spanish. Minor issues appear, such as the choice of \"afinamiento\" for \"fine‑tuning\" (the more common term is \"ajuste fino\") and occasional slightly formal constructions like \"una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\". These do not break fluency but slightly reduce the natural feel.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled consistently. Key terms – preentrenamiento, afinamiento, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding (anclaje) – are translated appropriately, and the occasional English acronym is retained with a Spanish explanation. The only small drawback is the less‑common translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"afinamiento\", but the meaning is clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator successfully adapts the podcast tone to Spanish, preserving the conversational style and cultural greetings (\"Hola y bienvenidos\"). References to common experiences with chatbots are kept, and the analogy of a consultant vs. an expert works equally well in Spanish. No cultural mismatches are observed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is retained. No significant content is omitted, and the translation does not add irrelevant material. The nuance that \"memoria\" features are a trick rather than true learning is preserved.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the lively podcast atmosphere, and is readily understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor lexical choices prevent it from being perfect, but they do not affect the core message. The translation would serve well for the intended listeners.\nScore breakdown: Readability 17, Fluency 16, Terminology 18, Contextual Adaptation 18, Information Completeness 19. Total = 88/100.\nThe translation is solid and only needs a few refinements (e.g., using \"ajuste fino\" and slightly shorter sentences) to reach native‑level polish."
