  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are clearly presented. Even complex concepts such as transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑expert can follow. Minor issues (e.g., missing accent in \"¿Por qué?\") do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural to a native speaker. There are a few small awkward spots: \"es del bachotage\" (mixing a French word into Spanish), \"Las conocimientos\" (gender agreement), and occasional punctuation quirks. These imperfections are limited and the text remains smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\" and \"grounding\" are all retained or appropriately translated. The only questionable choice is keeping the French word \"bachotage\" instead of a Spanish equivalent like \"memorización intensiva\".",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original tone and purpose well for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the conversational style is preserved. The occasional French loan‑word does not break the adaptation.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No sentences or ideas have been omitted, and the logical sequence of the discussion is intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, conveying the technical content accurately and maintaining the engaging, conversational tone of the original podcast. Minor grammatical slips and the retention of a French term are the only drawbacks, but they do not significantly affect the reader’s understanding. Overall, it is a clear, fluent, and faithful rendering of the source material.\n\n**Overall score (average of criteria): 18/20**\n\n**Breakdown:** Readability 18, Fluency 17, Terminology 16, Contextual Adaptation 18, Information Completeness 20."
