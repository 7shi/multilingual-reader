  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can grasp. Minor typographic choices (e.g., \"preentrenamiento\" vs \"pre‑entrenamiento\") do not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic. A few sentences are slightly heavy or wordy (e.g., the long analogy about hiring a consultant) and there are occasional minor punctuation quirks, but overall the flow is smooth and native‑like.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinado\" (though \"ajuste fino\" would be a more common rendering), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL), \"anclaje\" for grounding, etc. The translator kept the original acronyms and bold formatting where relevant, preserving the technical precision.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original podcast script are preserved. Cultural references are neutral, and the translation adapts idioms appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The name of the podcast remains unchanged, which is correct. Minor stylistic tweaks could make some passages sound more colloquial, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No key idea or example has been omitted, and the logical progression of the discussion is intact. Formatting differences (bold, italics) do not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains readable and largely natural for Spanish speakers, and respects the original tone of a podcast discussion. Minor improvements could be made in fluency (simplifying a few long sentences) and in choosing the most common Spanish equivalents for certain technical terms, but these do not detract significantly from the overall effectiveness.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.2 → 18/20."
