  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation conveys the content clearly and maintains a logical flow. Sentences are generally short and easy to follow, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in accessible language. A small hiccup appears in \"Cuando abres una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío\" where the verb form should be \"parte\" instead of \"partes\", but this does not significantly impair comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, and most idiomatic expressions (e.g., \"una chuleta\", \"estudiar de memoria\") fit the informal podcast tone. Minor awkwardness is found in a few literal renderings (e.g., \"ventana de contexto\" is acceptable but slightly technical, and the aforementioned verb agreement error). Overall fluency is very high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: \"pré‑entraînement\" → \"preentrenamiento\", \"affinage\" → \"ajuste fino\", \"apprentissage par transfert\" → \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"fenêtre de contexte\" → \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" kept as the same acronym, and \"grounding\" noted in parentheses. The translation respects the level of the audience and provides no confusing jargon.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references appropriately. The informal tone of the original (e.g., \"antisèche\") is mirrored with \"chuleta\". The examples and analogies are preserved, and the explanation of memory features is clear for Spanish‑speaking listeners. No cultural mis‑alignments are evident.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No sentences are omitted or meaning altered. The only minor loss is the slight nuance in the verb error mentioned earlier, which does not affect the factual content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It faithfully reproduces the original content, uses appropriate technical language, and maintains an engaging, conversational style suitable for a podcast audience. Minor grammatical slips (verb agreement) and a couple of slightly literal phrasings prevent a perfect score, but they do not hinder understanding. Overall, the work is accurate, natural, and well‑adapted to Spanish listeners.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18.2 ≈ 18/20."
