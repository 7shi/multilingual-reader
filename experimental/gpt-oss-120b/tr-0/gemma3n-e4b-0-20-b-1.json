  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version flows logically and the ideas are easy to follow. Sentences are mostly short and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are clear. Minor punctuation issues do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are a few awkward constructions: “Lo habéis entendido todo” (a bit forced), “enviarle a realizar un programa de formación” (should be “enviarlo a seguir un programa de formación”), and “una forma astucia de aprendizaje” (should be “una forma astuta”). These do not break understanding but slightly reduce the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, anclaje, etc. The original English acronyms (ICL, In‑Context Learning) are kept, which is appropriate for a tech‑savvy audience. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational tone of the podcast is preserved, and the translation respects Spanish‑language norms. Slightly informal forms (“Lo habéis…”) match the duo‑speaker format, though a more neutral plural could be smoother. Cultural references are unchanged, which is fine for this technical content.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of ‘memoria’ features. No significant omissions or additions were detected.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is very good. It conveys the technical content accurately, keeps the podcast’s engaging style, and is largely readable and natural. The few minor grammatical and stylistic slips keep the score just shy of perfect, but they do not affect the listener’s understanding.\n\nStrengths: correct terminology, complete information transfer, clear explanations. Areas for improvement: smooth out a couple of awkward phrasing choices to reach native‑level fluency.\n\nTotal score (out of 100): 88/100."
