  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to follow. Sentences are generally short and the dialogue format is preserved, making the flow clear. Minor issues such as occasional missing accents (e.g., “¿Necesito”) and a few typographical errors slightly hinder smooth reading, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward expressions that a native speaker would not use. Notably, the phrase “El aprendizaje en contexto es bachore” is ungrammatical and confusing, and some punctuation (commas, quotation marks) is misplaced. Overall, the language is understandable but not fully fluent.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”, and “grounding (anclaje)” are correctly translated and used consistently. The word “prompt” is left in English, which is acceptable for a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately. However, a few literal translations (e.g., “bachore” for “bachotage”) create confusion. Apart from those, the content is well‑adapted to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present. No significant ideas are omitted, and the dialogue structure is maintained. The only minor loss is the nuance of some explanatory asides that become slightly clunky in Spanish, but the information itself is intact.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical discussion accurately and retains the conversational style of the podcast. Readability and terminology are strong points, while fluency suffers from a few awkward phrasing and typographical errors. With minor edits—especially fixing the “bachore” phrase and polishing punctuation—the text would be a high‑quality Spanish version of the original.\nOverall score: 82/100."
