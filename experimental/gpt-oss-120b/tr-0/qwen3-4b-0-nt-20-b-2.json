  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and the dialogue flows logically. Most sentences are easy to understand, and complex concepts are explained in a straightforward way. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en…”, “partes de un contexto vacío”) slightly hinder smooth reading but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several literal renderings and small syntactic errors make it feel a bit forced in places (“¡Hola y bienvenido en…”, “El afinamiento…”, “Miren:”). Vocabulary is appropriate, yet the occasional awkward phrasing prevents full fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje, memoria a corto plazo. While “afinamiento” and “anclaje” are less common than the English loanwords, they are understandable and consistently used.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original intent, tone, and analogies (consultor brillante, bicicleta, etc.). Cultural adaptation is adequate for a Spanish‑speaking audience, though the opening greeting could be smoother (“¡Hola y bienvenido en…” → “¡Hola y bienvenidos a…”).",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is retained. No significant ideas are omitted, and the structure mirrors the source. The only minor issue is occasional redundancy in phrasing, but the content remains complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and maintains the educational tone. It is readable and technically sound, though it would benefit from a final proofread to smooth out a few awkward constructions and grammatical inconsistencies. The terminology is well handled, and the key concepts are fully preserved, making the text suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI fundamentals.\nScore (average of the five criteria): 16.6 ≈ 17/20.\nOverall rating: 17/20."
