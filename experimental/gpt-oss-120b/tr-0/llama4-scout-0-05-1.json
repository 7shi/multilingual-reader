  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented clearly. Sentences are generally short and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are easy to follow. Minor hiccups such as occasional formal “Usted” amidst a conversational tone do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic (e.g., “ventana de contexto”, “entre bastidores”). There are a few slight awkwardnesses: the formal “Usted lo ha entendido todo” feels out of place in an informal podcast, and the repetition “Aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en contexto)” is redundant. Nonetheless, a native speaker would find it smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste” for fine‑tuning, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ICL (Aprendizaje en contexto)”, “anclaje” for grounding, etc. The terms are used consistently throughout and the occasional English loan (fine‑tuning) is kept in parentheses, which helps the reader.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast’s tone and purpose, adapting cultural references appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only minor issue is the mixed register (formal “Usted” vs. informal conversational style), which slightly affects the cultural fit, but overall the intent and style are conveyed effectively.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present. No key points are omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as in the original. The slight redundancy mentioned above does not cause loss of content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains readable, and largely sounds natural. Minor stylistic inconsistencies (formal pronoun usage and a small redundancy) keep it from being perfect, but they do not detract from the listener’s understanding. The translator shows solid mastery of both languages and the subject matter.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 18 + Fluency 17 + Terminology 19 + Contextual Adaptation 16 + Information Completeness 18 = 88 / 100.\nThe translation is therefore rated as very good, with room for slight polish in register consistency and redundancy elimination."
