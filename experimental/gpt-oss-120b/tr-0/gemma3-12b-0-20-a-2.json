  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow; sentences are mostly short and logical. Complex AI concepts are explained clearly, and the flow mirrors the original dialogue. Minor hiccups (e.g., occasional long sentences) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native Spanish speaker, but a few expressions are slightly literal or awkward (e.g., \"entre bambalinas\" instead of \"entre bastidores\", \"el modelo experto en inglés\" without an article). Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary overall.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"ICL\" are correctly rendered and consistently used. The choice of \"anclaje\" for grounding is acceptable, and no important term is omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts cultural references suitably. The conversational tone is kept, and the examples are understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. A few literal translations (e.g., \"bambalinas\") feel a bit odd but do not break the context.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No sentences are omitted or significantly altered; the content remains faithful to the source while staying concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is very good. It conveys the technical content clearly, uses appropriate terminology, and keeps the lively podcast style. Minor fluency issues and a couple of slightly literal expressions keep it from being perfect, but they do not affect understanding. The translation would be well‑received by Spanish‑speaking listeners interested in AI concepts.\n\nStrengths: clear explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning; consistent terminology; faithful to original meaning.\nAreas for improvement: smooth out a few awkward phrasing choices (e.g., \"entre bambalinas\", missing articles) to achieve a more natural spoken style.\n\nScore out of 100: 88/100."
