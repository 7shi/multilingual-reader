  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the original ideas clearly. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the technical concepts are explained in simple terms. A few sentences are long and contain repetitions, which slightly hampers smooth reading, but overall a French‑speaking audience can follow the podcast script without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic, e.g., “desciframos”, “ventana de contexto”, “chuleta”. Minor issues appear, such as the repeated definition “aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (aprendizaje en contexto)” and a couple of slightly clunky constructions (“Da la impresión de que realmente están comenzando a recordar cosas de una sesión a otra”). These do not break comprehension but prevent a fully fluent feel.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento” (acceptable alternative to “ajuste fino”), “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “anclaje”. Consistency is maintained throughout the script. The only minor point is that “afinamiento” is less common in some Spanish technical circles, but it is still understandable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and tone of a conversational podcast. It adapts expressions to Spanish‑speaking listeners, using informal but appropriate phrasing such “chuleta” for “cheat‑sheet”. Cultural references are neutral, making the content accessible. A small redundancy (“aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (aprendizaje en contexto)”) could have been streamlined.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No content has been omitted, and no unnecessary additions were introduced. The translation faithfully reproduces the examples, analogies, and explanations.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate, comprehensive and easy to understand. It captures the educational yet informal style of the podcast and correctly renders the technical concepts. Minor fluency glitches and a bit of redundancy keep it from being perfect, but the quality is high and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI fundamentals.\n\n**Total average score:** 17.6/20"
