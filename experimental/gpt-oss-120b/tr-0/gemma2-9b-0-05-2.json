  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences convey the original meaning, but a few long sentences and occasional minor grammatical slips (e.g., \"sus vastas conocimientos\") slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in many places, but several expressions are atypical for native speakers: \"afianzamiento\" for fine‑tuning, the use of feminine pronoun \"Ella\" for IA, and odd punctuation such as « olvidado ». These choices make the prose feel a bit stilted.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved and correctly rendered (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL). The choice of \"afianzamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\" is debatable, and the French word \"ancrage\" is left untranslated, but overall the terminology is understandable and consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the podcast tone and adapts cultural references appropriately. Minor inconsistencies appear, such as calling the show \"Tecnología al Instante\" at the beginning and ending with the original French title \"Tech Éclair\", which slightly reduces cohesion.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key information from the original French script is present. No significant ideas are omitted, and the explanations are kept intact. Minor stylistic differences do not affect the conveyed content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original message accurately and retains the educational podcast style. While the overall comprehension is solid, the fluency suffers from a few unnatural lexical choices and minor grammatical errors. Terminology is mostly appropriate, though some terms could be replaced with more standard Spanish equivalents. The translation would benefit from a final proofreading pass to smooth out the awkward phrasing and ensure consistent naming of the podcast throughout the text.\nOverall rating: 16/20.\n\nOverall reasoning: The text is readable and complete, but fluency and some terminology choices lower the score. After minor revisions, it would reach a higher level of naturalness and precision."
