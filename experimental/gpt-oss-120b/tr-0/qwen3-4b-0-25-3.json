  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure. Most sentences convey the intended meaning, and the technical concepts are explained. However, there are several awkward phrasings (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en”, “Las conocimientos”, “Es del bacho”) and occasional missing articles that slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains multiple non‑native constructions and grammatical errors. Phrases like “Es del bacho”, “El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bacho”, and the misuse of gender/plural agreement reduce naturalness. Punctuation and capitalization are also inconsistent. A native speaker would notice these issues as unnatural.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved and correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding, prompt, etc. The use of Spanish equivalents (e.g., “anclaje”) is appropriate. Minor issues such as leaving “prompt” untranslated are acceptable in a technical context.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the podcast tone and the educational intent, but cultural adaptation is uneven. Some expressions are literal translations that sound odd in Spanish (“Hola y bienvenido en”, “bacho”). A few sentences could be rephrased for better alignment with Spanish‑speaking audiences.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the ideas and details from the French original are present. No significant content is omitted, and the logical flow of the discussion is maintained. Small typographical errors do not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation transmits the full content and technical depth of the original podcast, but it suffers from several linguistic shortcomings that affect readability and naturalness. The terminology is well handled, but the prose needs refinement to meet native‑speaker expectations. With some editing for grammar, idiomatic expressions, and cultural fit, the translation would be of high quality.\n\nStrengths: completeness, correct handling of technical terms, faithful representation of the original argument.\nWeaknesses: awkward phrasing, grammatical errors, occasional literal translations that feel unnatural in Spanish.\n\nA moderate revision focusing on fluency and contextual adaptation would raise the score substantially.\n\nFinal overall score (out of 20): 15"
