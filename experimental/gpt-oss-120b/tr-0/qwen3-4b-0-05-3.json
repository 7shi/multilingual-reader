  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the logical flow of the dialogue is preserved. However, there are several typographical and grammatical errors (e.g., “bienvenido en”, “cramar”, “las conocencias”) that can momentarily confuse readers and slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound natural, but a number of awkward constructions and misspellings break the native‑speaker feel. Issues such as the wrong preposition in “bienvenido en”, the non‑existent verb “cramar”, and inconsistent punctuation reduce overall fluency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL”, “grounding” → “anclaje”. The terminology is consistent and appropriate for the intended audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and adapts the podcast name to “Tech Destello”, which is a reasonable cultural adaptation. Minor phrasing issues prevent a perfect adaptation, but the overall message and tone are maintained.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All main points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantial information is omitted, though a few lexical mistakes (e.g., “cramar”, “conocencias”) could cause slight ambiguity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core ideas of the original French podcast and uses the correct technical vocabulary. Nevertheless, frequent typographical errors and some unnatural phrasing lower its readability and fluency. With careful proofreading and correction of the misspelled words, the quality would improve markedly.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
