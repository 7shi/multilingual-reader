    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall easy to follow and the dialogue format is preserved. Most sentences are clear and the logical flow mirrors the French original. A few sentences are slightly wordy (e.g., “Esta aproximación se llama aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”), but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward lexical choices: “afianzamiento” for fine‑tuning, “fundamentación” for *ancrage*, and occasional literal renderings (“consultor brillante” is acceptable but feels a bit formal). These make the prose feel slightly stilted for a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly (transfer learning, in‑context learning, ventana de contexto). However, the term for fine‑tuning is mistranslated as “afianzamiento” instead of the usual “ajuste fino” or “fine‑tuning”. The translation of *ancrage* as “fundamentación” is also non‑standard. Consistency suffers, lowering the score.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and purpose of the original podcast are well conveyed, and cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The occasional literal translation (e.g., “consultor temporal”) does not cause misunderstanding, but the unnatural terms noted above slightly weaken the adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the notion of temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memoria” features. No important information is omitted, and redundancy is minimal.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full content of the original podcast and is generally understandable. Strengths include faithful transmission of the technical concepts and retention of the conversational style. Weaknesses lie mainly in the choice of some technical terms and occasional unnatural phrasing, which prevent the text from feeling completely fluent to a native Spanish speaker. With minor adjustments to terminology (e.g., using “ajuste fino” and “anclaje”) and smoothing a few literal constructions, the translation would reach a higher quality level."
