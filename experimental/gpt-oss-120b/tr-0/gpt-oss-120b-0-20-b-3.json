  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in simple language. Sentence structures are a bit long in places, but they remain understandable for a podcast audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most of the script. There are a few literal renderings that feel slightly stiff (e.g., “El preentrenamiento.” as a standalone line, the mix of English acronyms, and occasional word order that mirrors French). Overall, a native speaker would find it fluent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento (fine‑tuning)”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “anclaje”. The use of the English acronym ICL is acceptable because it is explained. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the informal podcast tone, uses Spanish‑appropriate expressions, and even adds a colloquial “chuleta” which fits the context. Cultural references are preserved, and the intent of the original dialogue is fully conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No relevant information from the French source is omitted. All examples, analogies and explanations are present, and no redundancy is introduced. The translation is complete and faithful.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It faithfully conveys the original content, uses appropriate technical vocabulary, and maintains the conversational style of the podcast. Minor phrasing issues prevent it from being perfect, but they do not hinder comprehension. The translation would be well‑received by Spanish‑speaking listeners interested in AI topics.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17.8 ≈ 18/20."
