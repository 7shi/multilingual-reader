  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained in simple language. No major ambiguities impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker. Word order and verb tenses are appropriate. A few expressions are slightly colloquial (e.g., “una chuleta”), but they fit the informal podcast tone and do not break fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, anclaje. English terms are kept in parentheses when useful, helping readers who may recognize the original jargon.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapted idioms and examples to Spanish‑speaking listeners (e.g., “consultor brillante”, “una chuleta”). Cultural references are neutral, preserving the original intent while making the dialogue feel native.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All salient points from the original French script are present: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning; the temporary vs. permanent knowledge; the “memoria” feature as a clever prompt‑injection trick. No meaningful information was omitted.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, reads naturally, and respects the podcast’s conversational style. Minor colloquial choices are appropriate for the medium, and the terminology is handled consistently. The result is a fluent, complete, and easily understandable Spanish version of the original French script.\n\nPotential improvements: a few sentences could be slightly tightened for smoother flow, and the occasional informal word could be replaced with a more neutral term if a strictly formal register were desired. Nonetheless, the translation meets the expectations for a tech‑focused podcast audience.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
