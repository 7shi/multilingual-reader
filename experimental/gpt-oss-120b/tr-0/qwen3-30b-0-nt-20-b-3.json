  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences are clear, and the podcast‑style dialogue is preserved. Minor issues such as occasional missing hyphens (e.g., “preentrenamiento” vs. “pre‑entrenamiento”) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are a few awkward phrasings (“el afinamiento” instead of the more common “afinación” or “ajuste fino”, “el modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus discusiones”). The use of punctuation and exclamation marks is appropriate for Spanish, yet some sentences could be smoother.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly (ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL). However, the translation of “fine‑tuning” as “afinamiento” is uncommon; a more standard term would be “ajuste fino” or “afinación”. “Grounding” is translated as “anclaje”, which is acceptable but could be explained briefly. Consistency is good otherwise.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the style to Spanish well, using appropriate interjections, question marks, and maintaining the informal, conversational tone of a podcast. Cultural references are neutral, so no loss of intent occurs. Minor lexical choices could be refined, but the overall adaptation is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No key points are omitted, and the technical explanations remain intact. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and keeps the lively podcast atmosphere. Readability and completeness are excellent, while fluency and terminology could be polished slightly—especially the choice of words for fine‑tuning and occasional phrasing. Overall, a high‑quality translation suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners interested in AI concepts.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 87/100."
