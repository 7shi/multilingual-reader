  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the original structure, but several phrasing choices are awkward (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en …”, “Usted ha entendido todo.”). There is an inconsistent use of formal and informal pronouns, and occasional punctuation errors that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains a number of non‑native constructions: redundant parenthetical terms (\"anclaje (anclaje)\"), literal translations that sound odd (\"le damos simplemente los documentos de información exactos\"), and mixed registers. Despite these issues, a native speaker can still grasp the meaning without major effort.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly handled correctly. Key terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"transfer learning\" are translated appropriately. English loanwords like \"prompt\" and \"fine‑tuning\" are retained with parenthetical explanations, which is acceptable for the target audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and purpose, but cultural and tonal adaptation is uneven. Some expressions are not idiomatic in Spanish (e.g., \"bienvenido en\" instead of \"bienvenido a\"), and the switch between \"tú\" and \"usted\" creates inconsistency in the conversational tone.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present; no significant content is omitted or added. Minor duplication of terms does not affect the factual completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation faithfully transmits the content and technical concepts of the original podcast script. Readability and fluency are hindered by occasional unnatural phrasing and inconsistent formality, but the technical terminology is well‑handled and the information is complete. Improving idiomatic expressions and maintaining a consistent register would raise the quality substantially.\n\nFinal score (sum of criteria): 80/100."
