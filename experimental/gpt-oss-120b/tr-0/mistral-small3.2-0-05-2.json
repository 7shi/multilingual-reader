  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured, and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are understandable for a non‑specialist audience. Minor issues such as occasional long sentences and inconsistent hyphenation (\"pre‑entrenamiento\" vs \"preentrenamiento\") slightly affect flow, but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, using appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic expressions. A few phrases feel a bit forced – e.g., \"El aprendizaje en contexto es como empollar\" (the verb *empollar* is correct but less common in some dialects) and the repeated use of \"afinamiento\" instead of the more usual \"ajuste fino\". These minor awkwardnesses keep the fluency from being perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: \"transfer learning\" → \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"in‑context learning\" → \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\", \"ventana de contexto\" for \"context window\". Consistency is maintained throughout. The only slight drawback is the choice of \"afinamiento\" for \"fine‑tuning\", which is understandable but not the most common term in Spanish AI literature.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogy of a consultant is kept intact. Minor adjustments could make some sentences smoother for Spanish speakers, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and nuances from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No relevant information is omitted, and the logical order of the discussion is retained. Redundancies are minimal.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and keeps the conversational tone of the podcast. Minor issues such as inconsistent hyphenation, a less‑common term for \"fine‑tuning\", and a few slightly awkward phrasings prevent it from being flawless, but these do not affect the overall intelligibility or fidelity to the source. The work would benefit from a final proofread focusing on stylistic polish and terminology alignment with common Spanish AI usage.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17.4 ≈ 17/20."
