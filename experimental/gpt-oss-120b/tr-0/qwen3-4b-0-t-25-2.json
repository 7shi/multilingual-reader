    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable; the main ideas and the flow of the dialogue are clear. A few minor issues (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en …”, “entrenamiento previo” instead of the more common “pre‑entrenamiento”) do not block comprehension but slightly affect smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural for native speakers: “¡Hola y bienvenido en”, “anticipe” instead of a proper term like “antetapa” or “nota”, and the odd translation of “bachotage” as “corto circuito”. Sentence structures are generally correct, but the awkward phrasing reduces the overall naturalness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto* and *aprendizaje en contexto* are correctly rendered. However, the translation of “bachotage” to “corto circuito” is inaccurate, and the duplication “anclaje (anclaje)” is redundant. Consistency is good, but a few mismatches lower the score.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator keeps the original intent and the podcast‑style tone, but some idiomatic choices are off (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en”, “anticipe”). Cultural adaptation is acceptable, yet the occasional literalness makes the text feel slightly stilted for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present; no substantive content is omitted. The only loss is the nuance of the “bachotage” analogy, which is rendered incorrectly, slightly altering the meaning. Otherwise, the translation is complete and concise.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core content of the podcast accurately and keeps the technical discussion intact. Readability is good, but fluency suffers from several awkward phrasings and a mistranslation of a key analogy. Technical terminology is mostly well‑handled, though a few terms could be improved. Overall, the work is solid but would benefit from a native‑speaker revision to polish idiomatic expressions and correct the ‘bachotage’ translation.\n\nOverall Score: 15/20"
