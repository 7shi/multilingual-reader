  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version flows logically and the explanations of complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are clear and easy to follow. Minor hiccups such as occasional long sentences do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural for most part, but there are a few inconsistencies (mix of “tus” and “vuestras”, slightly literal rendering of “prompt”, occasional Spanish‑centric phrasing). These do not break the text but make it feel a bit less polished.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding → anclaje, etc. The English terms are kept in parentheses when useful, and the usage is consistent throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts idioms to Spanish (e.g., “consultor brillante”). Cultural references are neutral and appropriate. The only drawback is the pronoun inconsistency, which slightly weakens the adaptation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No relevant detail is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is very good. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational tone of the podcast, and is mostly fluent and readable. Minor issues—pronoun inconsistency, a few literal translations, and occasional stylistic roughness—prevent it from being perfect, but they do not affect the understanding of the material.\nScore out of 20 (average of criteria): 18.\nThe translation would benefit from a final proofread to harmonize pronouns and smooth a couple of slightly stiff phrases, after which it would be excellent for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nOverall score (out of 20): 18"
