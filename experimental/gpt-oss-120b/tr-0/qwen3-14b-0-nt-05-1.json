  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the structure of the original dialogue. However, there are several inconsistencies (mix of \"tú\" and \"usted\"), a typo (\"informaciónes\"), and a few clunky sentences (e.g., \"Usted ha entendido todo\"). These issues slightly hinder smooth comprehension for native readers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but occasional awkward phrasing and register shifts break the flow. Examples include \"es repasar\" for \"es del bachotage\" and the formal‑informal mix. Minor grammatical slips also affect fluency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\" and the parenthetical \"grounding\" are correctly rendered. The terminology is consistent and appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and purpose, and the explanations remain clear for Spanish‑speaking listeners. The only drawback is the inconsistent use of formal vs. informal pronouns, which slightly affects cultural appropriateness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the supplementary clarifications (e.g., explanation of \"memoria\") are kept intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original content accurately and retains the technical depth of the discussion. Readability and fluency are good but could be polished by correcting minor errors and unifying the register. Terminology and completeness are strong points. With a few stylistic adjustments, the text would read like a natural, professional podcast script in Spanish.\n\nOverall score (out of 20): 15.5 ≈ 15."
