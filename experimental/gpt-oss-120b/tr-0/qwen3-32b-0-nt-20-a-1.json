  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are clear. Minor issues such as a stray comma before “es” do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation sounds natural, but there are a few awkward or incorrect expressions: “relearnir” (should be “reaprender”), “da la impresión de que realmente empiezan a recordar cosas de una sesión a otra” could be smoother, and occasional punctuation choices feel forced. These glitches prevent a perfect native‑like fluency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (AEC), anclaje/grounding, memoria. The abbreviation ICL is correctly replaced by the Spanish equivalent AEC, and the terminology is used consistently throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts expressions to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the tone of a podcast dialogue is preserved. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve engagement, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue. The only loss is the minor typo “relearnir”, which does not delete any concept.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast content accurately and maintains a clear, instructional tone. Technical concepts are well translated, and the overall flow is understandable. A few lexical errors and slightly unnatural phrasing keep it from being flawless, but the work is solid and would be readily comprehensible to Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\nStrengths: faithful rendering of technical content, logical organization, appropriate terminology. Areas for improvement: correct the typo “relearnir”, smooth out a few clunky sentences, and fine‑tune punctuation for a more native feel.\n\nOverall score reflects a high‑quality translation with minor imperfections that are easy to fix.\n\nScore (average of criteria): 18/20"
