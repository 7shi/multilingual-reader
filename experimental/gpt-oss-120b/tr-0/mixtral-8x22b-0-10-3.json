  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and follows a logical flow. Most sentences are easy to understand, and the dialogue format is preserved. Minor issues such as occasional long sentences and a slight inconsistency in the podcast name (Tech Brillante vs. Tech Éclair) slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, but there are a few awkward phrasings (e.g., \"los documentos de información exactos\" and retaining the French word \"ancrage\"). The mix of French terminology and occasional literal constructions reduces the overall naturalness for native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well‑handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"ICL\" are correct. However, the word \"ancrage\" is left untranslated (should be \"anclaje\" or \"acoplamiento\"), and the quotation marks around « Mémoire » become \"Memoria\" without clarification that it is a feature name. Consistency could be improved.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and explanatory tone effectively, adapting cultural references appropriately. The only notable mismatch is the inconsistent podcast title, which could confuse listeners. Otherwise, the examples and analogies are well adapted to Spanish‑speaking audiences.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent knowledge distinction, and the explanation of “memory” features. No substantial content is omitted, and the structure mirrors the original.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. It is readable and mostly fluent, with minor lexical and consistency issues (especially the untranslated French term and the podcast name inconsistency). Technical terminology is largely appropriate, though a few terms could be better localized. The information is complete, making the text useful for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\nTo reach a higher score, the translator should ensure consistent naming, fully translate all borrowed terms, and smooth out the occasional literal phrasing.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 16/20.\n\n**Final rating:** 16/20 (very good, with room for minor refinements)."
