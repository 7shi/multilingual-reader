    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the dialogue clearly and the flow of ideas is easy to follow. Most sentences are well‑structured and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can understand. Minor issues such as the dangling \"Camille: Es decir, ¿\" and a slightly odd question \"¿Ya he oído este término?\" do not break comprehension, but they slightly lower smoothness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are a few awkward phrasings (e.g., \"¿Ya he oído este término?\", \"competencia permanente\" instead of \"habilidad permanente\", and occasional literal renderings). The conversational tone is largely preserved, yet the small glitches prevent a perfect native‑like fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\" and \"grounding\" rendered as \"anclaje\". The choices are appropriate for a tech‑savvy audience, and no important term is mistranslated or omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast style to Spanish well, using familiar interjections (¡Exactamente!, ¡Claro!) and preserving the analogy of a consultant. A few expressions could be more idiomatic (e.g., \"consultor brillante\" is fine, but \"anclaje\" is less common than \"enraizamiento\"), yet the overall intent and cultural tone are maintained.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is lost, and the logical progression of the discussion remains intact. The only minor loss is the truncated line \"Camille: Es decir, ¿\", which does not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and does a commendable job of rendering a technical podcast script into Spanish. It preserves the educational tone, the analogies, and the step‑by‑step explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning. Minor grammatical slips and a couple of less‑natural phrasings keep it from being flawless, but they do not hinder understanding. Overall, the work demonstrates a good grasp of both languages and the subject matter, delivering a readable and largely fluent version with accurate terminology and complete information.\n\n**Suggested improvements**: \n- Fix the incomplete line after \"Camille: Es decir, …\".\n- Replace \"¿Ya he oído este término?\" with a more natural \"¿Ya he escuchado este término?\" or \"¿Ya lo conozco?\".\n- Use \"habilidad permanente\" instead of \"competencia permanente\" for smoother flow.\n- Consider using \"enraizamiento\" or \"contextualización\" instead of \"anclaje\" for the concept of grounding.\nThese tweaks would raise fluency and readability closer to native level."
