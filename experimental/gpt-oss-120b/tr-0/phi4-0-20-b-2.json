    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the technical concepts are explained clearly, matching the original flow. Minor issues such as occasional long sentences do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are a few awkward expressions: “bachotaje” is not a standard Spanish term, “aprendizaje contextual automático” sounds clunky, and the repeated use of “el preentrenamiento” versus “preentrenamiento”. These moments slightly break the native‑speaker rhythm.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly well‑handled: pre‑training → preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning → afinamiento (acceptable though “ajuste fino” is more common), transfer learning → aprendizaje por transferencia, in‑context learning → aprendizaje en contexto (ALC). Consistency is good, and the key terms are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are neutral, and the Spanish version respects the target audience’s expectations. Only minor phrasing quirks slightly affect the adaptation.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is retained. No significant content is omitted or added, and the logical sequence of the dialogue is preserved.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It successfully transmits the technical explanations and conversational tone of the original podcast. A few lexical choices (e.g., “bachotaje”, “afinamiento”) feel a bit unnatural, but they do not hinder understanding. Minor stylistic refinements would bring the fluency up to perfection.\n\nOverall score (out of 20): 18"
