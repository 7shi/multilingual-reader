  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Sentences are generally clear and the complex concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. Minor punctuation inconsistencies (excessive opening exclamation marks, occasional missing closing marks) slightly hinder smooth reading, but overall comprehension is very good.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward constructions and typographical errors that a native speaker would avoid: repeated use of \"¡Exacto.\" instead of a more fluid \"¡Exacto!\", the misspelling \"Trasfiere\", the non‑standard \"ancoraje\" for \"grounding\", and occasional missing accents or misplaced commas. These issues make the text feel a bit stilted.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved (preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning, transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL). However, some choices are sub‑optimal: \"ajuste\" is used instead of the more precise \"fine‑tuning\" or \"ajuste fino\", and \"ancoraje\" is a misspelling of the correct Spanish term \"anclaje\" (or simply \"grounding\"). The word \"prompt\" is left untranslated, which is acceptable for a tech‑savvy audience but could have been noted. Consistency is good, but a few terms need correction.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The lively podcast style is well conveyed in Spanish, with enthusiastic interjections and a conversational tone that matches the original intent. Cultural references are unchanged, which is appropriate, and the translation keeps the educational yet informal register. Minor stylistic quirks (excessive exclamation marks) do not detract from the overall adaptation.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of \"memory\" features. No substantial information is lost; only minor typographical errors appear, which do not affect the conveyed content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is faithful and conveys the original message clearly. It succeeds in preserving the pedagogical tone of the podcast and includes virtually all the information. The main drawbacks are a few typographical errors, some non‑standard word choices, and occasional punctuation that makes the flow feel less natural. With a light editorial pass to correct \"Trasfiere\", \"ancoraje\", and to smooth the exclamation‑mark usage, the translation would reach a near‑perfect level."
