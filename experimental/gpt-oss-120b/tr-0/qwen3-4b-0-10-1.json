  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the ideas are clearly expressed. The flow of conversation mirrors the original French. Minor typo “Vézlo” instead of a correct form like “¡Véalo!” does not impede comprehension, so the readability remains high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, but a few grammatical slips (“le dar simplemente los documentos”, missing verb; “Hola y bienvenido en” instead of “Hola y bienvenidos a”; spacing before punctuation) and some literal constructions make it feel slightly stilted for a native speaker.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, grounding, y memoria están bien traducidos y se usan de forma consistente. The only small point is the retention of the English word “prompt”, which could have been rendered as “instrucción”, but this does not affect understanding.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish and keeps the explanatory style. Small awkward phrases (“Gracias por haber escuchado a nosotros”, “le dar simplemente”) and a couple of literal renderings slightly reduce cultural naturalness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present. No key ideas or examples are omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is preserved.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is very good. It conveys the technical content accurately and maintains the conversational flow of the original podcast. Minor typographical and grammatical errors prevent a perfect score, but they do not hinder understanding. The terminology is handled expertly, and the translation is largely faithful and natural for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 18, Fluency 16, Terminology 19, Contextual Adaptation 17, Information Completeness 20. Total: 90/100.\n\nSuggested improvements: correct the few typographical errors (Vézlo → Véalo), adjust small grammatical issues (e.g., \"le da\" instead of \"le dar\"), and fine‑tune idiomatic expressions (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenidos a\", \"Gracias por escucharnos\")."
