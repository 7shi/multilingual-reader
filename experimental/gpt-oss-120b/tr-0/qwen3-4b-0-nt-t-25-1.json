  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. However, several awkward phrasings (e.g., \"¡Hola y bienvenido en…\", \"es de escorchar\", \"le hemos proporcionado solo una antidesinfección\") and occasional grammatical slips make reading less smooth, especially for a non‑expert audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are many unnatural expressions that would not be used by native speakers: the mix of formal \"Usted\" with informal tone, the misuse of verbs (\"es de escorchar\"), and the bizarre word choice \"antidesinfección\" for \"chuleta\". These issues disrupt the natural flow, even though the overall meaning is clear.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"ICL\" are correctly rendered. Nonetheless, some translations of informal concepts are wrong (\"bachoter\" → \"es de escorchar\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\" is acceptable but not explained). The inconsistency lowers the score.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally respects the original intent, but cultural and register mismatches appear (formal \"Usted\" in a casual podcast, literal translations that sound odd in Spanish). The adaptation could have used more idiomatic Spanish for examples and analogies.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present; no sections are omitted. Minor inaccuracies (e.g., \"antidesinfección\" instead of \"chuleta\" or \"hoja de referencia\") do not remove information but introduce confusion. Hence the completeness is high.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core content of the podcast and keeps the structure of the dialogue, but it suffers from several lexical errors, unnatural phrasing, and occasional mistranslations that affect fluency and readability. Technical terminology is mostly correct, yet the handling of informal analogies needs improvement. A revision focusing on natural Spanish expressions and correcting the noted errors would raise the quality substantially.\n\nOverall score: 13/20."
