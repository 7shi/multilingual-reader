    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and the flow of ideas follows the original script. Most sentences are easy to understand, and the technical concepts are presented in a straightforward way. Minor typographical errors (e.g., “begins” instead of “comienzas”) and occasional awkward phrasing slightly hinder smooth comprehension, but they do not obstruct the overall meaning.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several instances of non‑native or literal wording: “Lo han entendido todo” (should be “Lo ha entendido todo” or “Lo han entendido”), “El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotage” (mixes French term), and “cuando begins una nueva conversación”. These errors, together with occasional missing accents, make the text feel less fluid for a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is generally well‑handled: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, anclaje, etc. The only notable misstep is the retention of the French word “bachotage” instead of a Spanish equivalent (e.g., “estudiar intensamente”). Otherwise the term usage is consistent and appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural references are minimal, so most content transfers directly. However, the literal use of “bachotage” and a few Anglicisms (“begins”) show limited adaptation to Spanish‑speaking listeners, preventing a fully optimized version.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are retained: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent knowledge distinction, and the explanation of “memory” features. No significant information is omitted, and the structure mirrors the source closely.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original message accurately and maintains most of the technical detail. Readability and completeness are strong, but fluency and cultural adaptation suffer from a few literal translations and typographical slips. Addressing the non‑Spanish terms (e.g., replacing “bachotage” with a proper Spanish phrase) and correcting minor errors would raise the quality to a near‑native level.\n\n**Strengths**: faithful content transfer, correct handling of most technical vocabulary, clear logical flow.\n**Areas for improvement**: eliminate French/English remnants, fix minor grammatical mistakes, choose more natural Spanish expressions for idiomatic parts.\n\nWith these refinements, the translation would be both precise and fully natural for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\n**Final scores**: Readability 16/20, Fluency 14/20, Terminology 17/20, Contextual Adaptation 15/20, Information Completeness 19/20."
