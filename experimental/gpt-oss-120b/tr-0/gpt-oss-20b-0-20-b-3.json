  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the complex ideas about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained clearly. A few long sentences could be broken up for smoother reading, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker, especially for a tech‑savvy audience. Minor issues appear, such as the use of «afinamiento» instead of the more common «ajuste fino», and occasional anglicisms like “prompt” that are acceptable in the domain but slightly break the flow. Overall the language is smooth and idiomatic.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled well: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding, etc. However there is some inconsistency (\"afinamiento\" vs \"ajuste fino\") and the French quotation marks « » are retained, which is unusual in Spanish. The core terminology is accurate and consistent enough for the intended audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone and pedagogical style. Cultural references are neutral, and analogies (consultor brillante, aprender a andar en bicicleta) are well adapted to Spanish. The only slight mismatch is the use of French guillemets, but it does not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant details are omitted, and the supplemental explanations (e.g., why the memory is temporary) are kept. Redundancy is minimal and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains readable, and feels natural for a Spanish‑speaking tech audience. Minor stylistic tweaks—particularly standardising terminology (preferir \"ajuste fino\") and using Spanish quotation marks—would bring it to an excellent level.\n\nThe translation scores 86/100, reflecting strong performance with small areas for refinement.\n\nScore out of 100: 86"
