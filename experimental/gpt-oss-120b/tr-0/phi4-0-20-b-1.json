  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the pedagogical analogies (consultant vs. expert, cramming for an exam) are preserved, making the technical content accessible to a general audience. A few sentences are slightly long, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural to a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and the dialogue flows smoothly. Minor points of non‑native feel are the use of “el afinamiento” (more common would be “ajuste fino”) and the introduction of the abbreviation “ALC” instead of keeping the original “ICL”. These do not break fluency but are a touch less idiomatic.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally well‑handled: “preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “memoria a corto plazo”, etc. The switch from “ICL (In‑Context Learning)” to “ALC (Aprendizaje en Contexto)” is consistent within the translation but diverges from the source abbreviation, which could cause a slight mismatch for readers familiar with the English term. Otherwise terminology is consistent and appropriate for the intended audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references correctly (e.g., using “consultor brillante” instead of “consultant”) and respects the podcast format. It maintains the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. The occasional French‑style phrasing (“el afinamiento”) is still understandable for Spanish speakers, so the adaptation is largely successful.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original script is present. No ideas are omitted, and the closing remarks match the source. The translation even preserves the parenthetical explanations of acronyms and technical concepts. Redundancy is avoided, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the original podcast’s explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning clearly and accurately. Minor stylistic choices (such as “afinamiento” and the change of the ICL acronym) prevent a perfect score, but they do not detract significantly from comprehension or naturalness. Overall, the translation is readable, fluent, technically accurate, and faithful to the source’s intent.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18/20."
