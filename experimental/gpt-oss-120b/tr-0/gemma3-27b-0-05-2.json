  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured, and the complex AI concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can understand. Only a few very long sentences could be split for extra clarity, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for native Spanish speakers. Vocabulary is appropriate and most idiomatic expressions are well chosen. Minor awkwardness appears in a couple of literal renderings (e.g., “ventana de contexto” and “memoria a corto plazo de la IA”), yet they do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly handled: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ICL (In‑Context Learning)*, and *grounding* are all rendered consistently. The choice of “ventana de contexto” aligns with the terminology used in Spanish AI literature.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish‑speaking listeners (e.g., “Hola y bienvenidos”). Cultural references are neutral, and the speaker’s informal, conversational style is preserved. The few English loanwords are explained in parentheses, which is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original script is present. No sections are omitted or altered in meaning, and the logical flow of the dialogue is maintained. The translation also avoids unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the original content accurately, uses appropriate technical language, and reads naturally for Spanish‑language listeners. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve flow, but the work is essentially excellent and suitable for publication as a podcast transcript.\n\nOverall score (out of 20): 18.5 → rounded to 18."
