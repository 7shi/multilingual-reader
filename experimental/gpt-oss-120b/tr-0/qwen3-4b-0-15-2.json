  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the structure of the original dialogue. However, several sentences are awkward or contain errors (e.g., “Usted ha entendido todo”, “El aprendizaje en contexto, es aplastamiento”). These hiccups force the reader to pause and reinterpret, reducing smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mixes formal \"Usted\" with informal language, creating an inconsistent register. Some expressions are literal translations that sound unnatural in Spanish (e.g., “aplasticamiento”, “es aplastamiento”). Vocabulary choices are mostly adequate, but the overall flow feels stilted.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and the acronym ICL are correctly rendered. The English term \"fine‑tuning\" is left untranslated, and \"grounding\" remains in English, which is acceptable but inconsistent. Overall, terminology is appropriate and consistent enough for the target audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and educational tone, but the shift from the original informal French style to a formal Spanish register (use of \"Usted\") alters the conversational feel. Cultural references are preserved, yet the tone mismatch detracts from full adaptation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas, examples, and analogies from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted, and the dialogue structure is maintained. Minor wording errors do not cause loss of meaning.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the core content and most technical terminology, but suffers from inconsistent register, several awkward phrasing, and a few literal mistranslations that affect readability and naturalness. While the information is complete, polishing the language to a consistent tone and correcting the erroneous expressions would markedly improve quality.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 14/20."
