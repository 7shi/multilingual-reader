    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are short and the flow mirrors the original dialogue. Minor hiccups such as isolated “El preentrenamiento.” and occasional long sentences slightly affect smoothness, but a native reader can understand the concepts without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., “El afinado” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”, “una hoja de trucos” feels a bit colloquial, and inconsistent hyphenation of pre‑entrenamiento). Vocabulary is appropriate, yet the occasional literal rendering makes it feel a bit stilted.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well‑handled: \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"anclaje\" are appropriate. However, inconsistency appears with “afinado” vs. the earlier “ajuste fino”, and the acronym ICL is left untranslated, which is acceptable but could have been explained. Overall, terminology is accurate but not perfectly consistent.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural references are neutral and the examples (consultant, cheat‑sheet) work well for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Slightly literal phrasing does not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is omitted, and the dialogue structure is maintained. Minor stylistic differences do not affect content completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and keeps the educational tone intact. Readability and completeness are strong, but fluency suffers from occasional literalness and inconsistent terminology (e.g., “afinado”). A revision focusing on consistent use of standard technical terms (preferably \"ajuste fino\") and smoothing out a few long sentences would raise the overall quality to a near‑native level.\nOverall score (average): 16.2/20."
