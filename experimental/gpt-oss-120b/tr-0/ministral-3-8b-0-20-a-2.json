  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the dialogue is easy to follow. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia and aprendizaje en contexto are explained with clear analogies. A few long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but overall a Spanish‑speaking audience can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places. Vocabulary is appropriate and the style matches a podcast script. Minor awkwardness appears in phrases like \"el 'aprendizaje por transferencia'?\" and the use of \"afinado\" (less common than \"ajuste fino\"). Nevertheless, the language is smooth and idiomatic.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, memoria a corto plazo, etc. The choice of \"afinado\" for fine‑tuning is understandable but not the most standard term, which slightly lowers the score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately. French‑specific expressions are replaced with Spanish equivalents, and the tone remains conversational and engaging for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines and informational content from the original French script are present. No essential detail is omitted, and the supplemental explanations (e.g., analogies) are retained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is very good. It conveys the technical content clearly and keeps the lively podcast tone. Minor lexical choices (e.g., \"afinado\" vs. \"ajuste fino\") and occasional slightly clunky phrasing prevent it from being perfect, but the translation is accurate, complete and highly understandable for Spanish listeners.\nScore Summary: Readability 18/20, Fluency 17/20, Terminology 16/20, Contextual Adaptation 18/20, Information Completeness 20/20."
