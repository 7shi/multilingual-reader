    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. Most sentences are logical, but a few awkward constructions (e.g., “¿Qué es?” after the comparison) slightly hinder smooth comprehension. The change of the podcast name to “Tech Luz” may also confuse readers familiar with the original title.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are occasional clumsy phrases (“solo le proporcionamos un esquema o guía justo antes de que comience a hablar con usted”, “La diferencia entre copiar para un examen y dominar realmente un tema ¿qué es?”) and the inconsistent podcast name. Overall, a native speaker would understand it, but it does not flow as smoothly as a fully polished text would.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, etc., are all correctly rendered and used consistently. No important term is mistranslated or omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and purpose accurately and adapts the content for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor issues such as the wrong podcast name (“Tech Luz” instead of “Tech Éclair”) and a few literal renderings slightly reduce cultural appropriateness, but the overall message remains intact.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the substantive information from the French script is present. The only notable omission is the final punctuation and the correct podcast name in the closing line. No critical content is lost.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion effectively. Technical terms are accurate, and the core ideas are preserved. Minor fluency hiccups, a few awkward phrasings, and an inconsistent podcast title prevent it from being perfect, but the text is still highly understandable for the target audience.\n\nStrengths: correct terminology, faithful conveyance of concepts, good readability.\nWeaknesses: occasional unnatural phrasing, inconsistency in proper nouns, small punctuation issues.\n\nWith a quick editorial pass to smooth out the noted awkward sentences and fix the name, the translation would reach a near‑native quality level.\n\nOverall score (out of 20): 16"
