  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear order. Most sentences are easy to follow, and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained with accessible analogies. A few minor hiccups—such as the isolated “El preentrenamiento.” line and occasional long sentences—do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native Spanish speaker overall. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. Some phrasing is slightly awkward (e.g., “Vea:” after “El aprendizaje por transferencia es la clave.”, and the use of “el afinamiento” without the English “fine‑tuning” in parentheses), but these are minor and do not break the fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “anclaje (grounding)”. The translator kept the terminology consistent throughout and provided Spanish equivalents that a technical audience will understand. No important term is lost or mistranslated.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style of the podcast script. Cultural references are neutral and thus transferable. Small stylistic choices (e.g., retaining the French‑style quotation marks « ») could be replaced with Spanish guillemets, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French source is retained. No sentences or ideas are omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as in the original. Redundancies are not introduced, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains understandable, and largely sounds natural in Spanish. Minor stylistic and phrasing tweaks could raise fluency to perfection, but the work is already very strong and suitable for the intended audience of a tech‑focused podcast.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.4/20.\n\nScore: 18.4"
