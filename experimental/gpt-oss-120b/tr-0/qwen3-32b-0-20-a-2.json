  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is overall clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the concepts are explained in a way that a Spanish‑speaking audience can understand. Minor issues such as the missing hyphen in “preentrenamiento” and occasional redundant wording slightly affect smoothness, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds mostly natural, with appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic expressions (“consultor brillante”, “analogy perfecta”). Some awkward phrases appear (“una IA completamente nueva”, the redundant definition of ICL, and the typo “AIC” instead of ICL) which make a few sentences feel stilted.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally handled well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\" (though \"ajuste fino\" would be more common), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\". The main flaw is the inconsistency where ICL is later rendered as “AIC”, which could confuse readers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the original tone and intent effectively, using Spanish‑cultural references and maintaining the podcast‑like conversational style. The analogy of a consultant and the explanation of memory features are well rendered.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the original information is retained; no essential points are omitted. The only drawback is the typo “AIC” that could mislead about the acronym, but the overall content remains complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of conveying the original French podcast script into Spanish. It preserves the educational tone, explains complex AI concepts clearly, and adapts the conversation naturally for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor inconsistencies in terminology (especially the erroneous \"AIC\" for ICL) and occasional awkward phrasing prevent it from being perfect, but the overall quality is high and the message is fully transmitted.\nScore out of 100: 80/100."
