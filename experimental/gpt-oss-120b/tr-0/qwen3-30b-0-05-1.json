  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand. Sentences flow logically and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor punctuation errors (e.g., missing opening ¿ in \"¿Porque...\", inconsistent use of hyphens) and a few long sentences slightly affect smoothness, but overall a reader can follow the discussion without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, but there are occasional awkward word choices such as \"afinación\" for \"fine‑tuning\" (the more common term is \"ajuste fino\"), the hyphenated \"pre‑entrenamiento\", and a few overly literal renderings (e.g., \"es una memoria de uso único\"). These do not break comprehension but make the text feel slightly less native.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly well‑handled: \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\" are appropriate. The main drawback is the translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"afinación\", which is less standard in the AI community. Consistency is good otherwise.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast’s informal, conversational tone and adapts idiomatic expressions (e.g., \"consultor brillante\"). Cultural references are kept neutral, which is suitable for a broad Spanish‑speaking audience. Only minor stylistic tweaks could improve the naturalness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the logical order of the dialogue is maintained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the original message clearly. It retains the educational yet casual podcast style and includes all key points. The main areas for improvement are the choice of a few technical terms (prefer \"ajuste fino\" over \"afinación\") and smoothing out minor punctuation and phrasing issues to achieve a fully native feel."
