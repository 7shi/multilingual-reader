    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the podcast’s explanatory style is preserved. Minor punctuation quirks (e.g., an unnecessary comma) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most parts, but there are occasional awkward constructions (e.g., “Miren:” instead of a smoother “Observad”, mixed use of “Y soy Luc.” vs. “Yo soy Luc.”, and the comma after “El aprendizaje en contexto”). These slightly reduce the fluidity for a native speaker.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and “anclaje”. The English terms are kept in quotes where appropriate, and the terminology is consistent throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the informal podcast tone and adapts cultural references appropriately. The only drawback is the inconsistent use of second‑person pronouns (“tus” vs. “vuestra”), which may feel slightly jarring to some Spanish readers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present. No ideas are omitted, and the explanations are as detailed as in the source. No redundant or extraneous content is added.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the original content accurately, uses appropriate technical vocabulary, and remains largely clear and natural. Small stylistic inconsistencies and a few awkward phrases keep it from being perfect, but they do not affect the listener’s understanding.\n\nStrengths: faithful rendering of technical concepts, consistent terminology, thorough coverage of the source material.\nWeaknesses: occasional register slips and pronoun inconsistency, minor punctuation/fluency issues.\n\nThe translation would be fully polished with a final stylistic pass to harmonize pronouns and smooth out the few awkward expressions.\n\nScore out of 20: 18"
