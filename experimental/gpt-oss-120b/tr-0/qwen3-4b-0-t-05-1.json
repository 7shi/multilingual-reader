  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and follows the original structure, but several sentences are awkward or contain mistranslations (e.g., “es apretar” instead of “es como bachotear”, inconsistent use of formal ‘Usted’ versus informal ‘tú’, missing inverted exclamation marks). These issues slightly hinder smooth comprehension for a native reader.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are numerous unnatural expressions and grammatical slips: “Usted ha entendido todo”, “el afinado” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”, “la IA ‘se recuerda’ de estas informaciones”, and the odd phrase “es apretar”. The translation feels literal in places and lacks the fluid, conversational tone expected in a podcast script.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly correct – preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, etc. – but some terms could be rendered more idiomatically (e.g., “afinado” → “ajuste fino”, “anclaje” → “grounding” could stay as “anclaje” but needs clarification). Consistency is decent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and explanatory style, yet cultural‑linguistic adaptation is uneven. The mix of formal and informal registers, occasional literal translations, and the erroneous “es apretar” reduce the natural fit for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas from the French source are present; no major sections are omitted or added. The content remains faithful to the original, covering pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and memory features.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core message and retains the technical depth of the original podcast, but it suffers from several fluency and readability problems that make it feel stilted. Improving idiomatic phrasing, consistent register, and fixing literal mistranslations would raise the quality substantially. Terminology is adequate, and no information is lost, which is a strong point.\n\nOverall, the work is functional but needs polishing to reach a native‑speaker level of naturalness and clarity.\n\nScore out of 100: 73/100.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 14/20, Fluency 12/20, Terminology 15/20, Contextual Adaptation 14/20, Information Completeness 18/20.\n\nRecommendation: Revise the problematic sentences, use consistent second‑person informal tone (or formal if the podcast style demands), and replace awkward literal translations with idiomatic Spanish equivalents.\n\n---\n**Detailed Reasoning**\n- **Readability (14):** Generally clear, but odd phrases and missing punctuation disrupt flow.\n- **Fluency (12):** Numerous unnatural constructions; literal word‑for‑word rendering evident.\n- **Terminology (15):** Correct technical terms, though some could be refined for standard usage.\n- **Contextual Adaptation (14):** Intent preserved, but register inconsistencies and cultural mismatches lower the score.\n- **Information Completeness (18):** No loss of content; the translation is comprehensive.\n\n---\n**Total Score**: 73"
