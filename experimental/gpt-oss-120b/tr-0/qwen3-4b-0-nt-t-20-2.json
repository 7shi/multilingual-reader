  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the dialogue clearly and the logical flow mirrors the original. Most sentences are easy to follow, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can grasp. Minor typographical errors (e.g., \"Apena\" instead of \"Apenas\") do not substantially impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward or unidiomatic expressions: \"Usted ha entendido todo\" (should be \"¡Has entendido todo!\" or \"¡Ha entendido todo!\"), missing accent marks, and occasional literal constructions that feel stiff. These issues lower the overall smoothness for native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are correctly rendered and consistent. The occasional retention of English acronyms (ICL) is appropriate because they are standard in the field.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The informal podcast tone is preserved, and cultural references are neutral, which works for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Minor phrasing issues (e.g., \"bienvenido en\" instead of \"bienvenido a\") slightly reduce the naturalness, but the intent and purpose are fully conveyed.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the original ideas, examples, and analogies are present. No substantive information is omitted, and the translation does not add irrelevant material. Small typographical slips do not affect the completeness of the content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is accurate and retains the educational spirit of the original podcast. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency suffers from a handful of awkward phrases and minor typos. The adaptation to Spanish is faithful, and no important information is lost. With a final polish to correct the few unnatural expressions, the text would be fully native‑speaker quality.\n\n**Final score (out of 100): 83**\n\n**Breakdown:** 18 (readability) + 14 (fluency) + 17 (terminology) + 15 (contextual adaptation) + 19 (information completeness) = **83**."
