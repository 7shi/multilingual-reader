  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas flow logically. Most sentences are easy to understand, but occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., mixing formal ‘Usted’ with informal ‘tú’, “Usted ha entendido todo”) and a notable mistake (“se sube al caballo” instead of “se sube a la bicicleta”) slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but the inconsistent register (formal vs. informal) and a few clumsy constructions (“Usted ha entendido todo”, “el sistema busca rápidamente en tus intercambios anteriores la información que parece relevante”) make it feel less fluent than native speech.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, memoria a corto plazo, anclaje, etc., are correctly rendered and consistently used throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent and tone are preserved, and the translation adapts the examples to Spanish‑speaking listeners. The main drawback is the accidental switch to “caballo” (horse) instead of “bicicleta” and the register inconsistency, which slightly reduces cultural appropriateness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present; no ideas are omitted. The only minor issue is the horse/bicycle slip, which does not remove information but introduces a small inaccuracy.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the technical content well. It would benefit from a consistent register (preferably informal ‘tú’ to match the original conversational style) and correcting the bicycle‑horse error. Minor stylistic tweaks would raise readability and fluency to near‑perfect levels.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 17.0 / 20."
