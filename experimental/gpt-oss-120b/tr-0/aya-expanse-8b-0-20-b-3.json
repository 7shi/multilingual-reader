  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained clearly. Minor issues such as the missing opening exclamation mark and the unexpected change of the podcast name to “Tech Luz” slightly disrupt flow, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, but a few literal renderings feel awkward (e.g., “copiar para un examen” instead of a more idiomatic “bachotear para un examen”). The inconsistent use of punctuation (missing opening “¡”) and the alteration of the brand name reduce native‑speaker fluency. Nevertheless, most phrasing is smooth and appropriate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto” and “aprendizaje en contexto” are correctly translated and consistently used. The occasional retention of English terms in parentheses (e.g., fine‑tuning) helps maintain precision.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and purpose, but cultural adaptation is uneven. The change of the podcast title to “Tech Luz” deviates from the original branding, which could confuse listeners. Some idiomatic choices (e.g., “copiar para un examen”) are less natural in Spanish. Overall, the adaptation is adequate but not optimal.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is lost, and the explanations remain intact. The only notable deviation is the renamed podcast title and a minor punctuation oversight, which do not affect the factual content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and preserves the technical depth of the original podcast script. It is largely readable and accurate, with good handling of specialized vocabulary. Minor shortcomings—especially the inconsistent brand name, occasional literal phrasing, and punctuation errors—prevent it from being completely natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but the overall quality is high.\n\nScore (average of criteria): 17/20."
