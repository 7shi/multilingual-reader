  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and the dialogue structure is preserved. Most sentences convey the original meaning, but there are occasional awkward phrasings (e.g., \"¡Hola y bienvenido en\") and minor punctuation issues that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural to a native speaker: \"bienvenido en\", \"corto circuito\" for the metaphor, \"una anticipe\" instead of \"una hoja de referencia\", and \"en la sombra\" for \"behind the scenes\". Verb agreement and article usage also contain errors, making the text feel translated rather than original.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\". The choice of \"afinamiento\" for \"fine‑tuning\" is acceptable, though \"ajuste fino\" would be more common. \"Grounding\" rendered as \"anclaje\" is understandable but not the standard term in Spanish AI literature.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The informal podcast tone is retained and the content is culturally appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor issues such as the opening greeting and some literal translations reduce the naturalness, but the overall intent and style are conveyed.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant information is lost; all concepts, examples, and analogies from the French original appear in the translation. Small mis‑renderings (e.g., \"corto circuito\") do not omit content, so completeness is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the substance of the original podcast and preserves the dialogue format, but it suffers from several fluency and idiomatic issues that make it feel somewhat stilted. Technical terminology is largely accurate, though a few terms could be refined. Improving natural expressions and fixing minor grammatical errors would raise the overall quality significantly.\n\nStrengths: complete coverage of the source material, correct handling of most technical terms, clear logical flow.\nWeaknesses: occasional unnatural phrasing, minor mistranslations of idiomatic expressions, inconsistent use of standard AI terminology.\nOverall, the translation is functional and informative but needs polishing for native‑speaker fluency.\n\nScore out of 100: 76/100"
