  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and the flow of the dialogue is preserved. However, there are several typographical and grammatical slips (e.g., missing accent in \"¿Porque\", the odd phrase \"El aprendizaje en contexto es bachore\", and the truncated sentence \"Como discutimos en nuestro último episodio sobre los Transformers\"). These minor errors force the reader to pause, slightly lowering readability.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound unnatural to a native speaker. Phrases such as \"El aprendizaje en contexto es bachore\" and \"¿Es lógico?\" are awkward, and the translation sometimes mixes formal and colloquial registers. The overall cadence is stilted, indicating that a native‑speaker revision would be needed for smoothness.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, transferencia de aprendizaje, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding, memoria). Nevertheless, there is inconsistency: \"el ajuste\" is used instead of the more precise \"ajuste fino\", and the English word \"prompt\" is left untranslated. Such inconsistencies can confuse readers unfamiliar with the jargon.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone of a podcast discussion. Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is required. Minor issues (e.g., the literal \"¿Es lógico?\" which sounds odd in Spanish) prevent a fully natural adaptation, but the overall message remains intact.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is preserved. Minor punctuation quirks do not affect the completeness of the conveyed information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the full content and the educational tone of the original podcast, but it suffers from several fluency and readability issues, as well as minor inconsistencies in technical terminology. A native‑speaker edit would smooth out awkward phrasing, correct typographical errors, and ensure consistent use of specialized terms. Overall, it is a solid draft that needs polishing before publication.\n\nOverall Score (out of 100): 72"
