  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but several awkward phrasings (e.g., \"Imagínense que se envían una nueva IA\", \"Usted ha entendido todo\") and a serious mistranslation of \"cramming\" as \"aplastamiento\" hinder smooth comprehension. The overall flow is decent, but occasional grammatical slips reduce readability.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are multiple non‑native constructions and lexical choices that feel forced: \"aplastamiento\", \"antiesencia\", inconsistent use of formal \"Usted\" in a conversational podcast, and occasional verb‑subject agreement errors. The translation sounds stilted in places, so fluency is moderate.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"transfer learning\" (\"aprendizaje por transferencia\"), \"In‑Context Learning\" (\"aprendizaje en contexto\"), and \"fine‑tuning\" are correctly rendered. However, some terms are duplicated or poorly chosen (\"anclaje (anclaje)\" and the wrong translation of \"cramming\"), slightly lowering the score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the podcast tone, but the formal \"Usted\" contrasts with the informal French original. Cultural adaptation is otherwise fine, though the erroneous \"aplastamiento\" changes the intended metaphor, and \"antiesencia\" is not a recognized Spanish expression.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas and dialogue are present; no substantive content is omitted. Minor lexical errors do not remove information, so completeness is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the overall message and retains most of the technical content, but suffers from several awkward or incorrect renderings that affect naturalness and clarity. While terminology is largely accurate, the misuse of words like \"aplastamiento\" and \"antiesencia\" creates confusion. A revision focusing on idiomatic Spanish phrasing and correcting the problematic translations would raise the quality significantly.\nOverall rating: 15/20 (average of the five criteria). The text is functional but needs polishing for fluency and precision.\n\nScore: 15"
