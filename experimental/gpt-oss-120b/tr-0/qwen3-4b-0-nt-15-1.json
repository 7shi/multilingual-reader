  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original flow, but there are several typographical and grammatical errors (e.g., \"Apena aprende\", \"cuando usted afinan\", \"Viando\" instead of \"Veo\"). These mistakes force the reader to pause and re‑interpret, lowering smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound unnatural for a native speaker. Expressions such as \"antiespesa\", \"es del bachotaje\", and the inconsistent use of formal \"usted\" versus informal tone make the translation feel stilted. Nevertheless, most of the dialogue is coherent.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms (preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding) are mostly rendered correctly and consistently. The only notable lapse is the mistranslation of \"antisèche\" as \"antiespesa\", which is not a recognized term in Spanish.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast’s explanatory style and intent, but cultural adaptation is limited. The formal \"usted\" creates a distance that the original French did not have, and some idiomatic Spanish equivalents are missing (e.g., \"chuleta\" instead of \"antiespesa\").",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas and examples from the original are present; no sections are omitted. Minor inaccuracies (e.g., the wrong word for \"antisèche\") slightly affect the precision of the conveyed information.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core message of the podcast and keeps the structure of the dialogue, which is a strong point. However, frequent lexical slips, awkward phrasing, and a few mistranslated technical terms hinder readability and naturalness. A careful proofreading and replacement of non‑standard words would raise the quality substantially.\n\nOverall, the work is functional but needs refinement to reach a native‑like level.\n\nScore out of 20: 14/20.\n\n**Detailed reasoning** is provided for each criterion above.\n\n**Final score**: 14"
