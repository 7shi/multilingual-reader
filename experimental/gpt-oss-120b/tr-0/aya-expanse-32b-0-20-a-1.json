  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and the flow of ideas follows the original French script. Most sentences are understandable, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can follow. Minor issues such as occasional long sentences and the occasional gender error (e.g., “un IA” instead of “una IA”) slightly hinder smooth comprehension, but they do not prevent understanding.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward constructions and grammatical slips that a native speaker would notice. Examples include “un IA”, “partes de un contexto vacío”, and mismatched pronouns (“Ella lo olvida todo”). Some phrasing is literal (“la ventana de contexto”) and feels a bit stiff, yet overall the dialogue is intelligible.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “ventana de contexto” and “anclaje” are correctly rendered and kept consistent. The translator also kept the English abbreviations (ICL) and provided Spanish equivalents, which aids comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal podcast tone and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., using “chuleta” for “cheat‑sheet”). Minor gender mismatches and a few literal translations slightly reduce the naturalness for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but the overall intent and style of the original are retained.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the explanatory examples are kept intact. The translation is faithful to the source content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does an excellent job conveying the technical content and the conversational spirit of the podcast. Strengths include accurate terminology and full coverage of the source material. Weaknesses lie mainly in occasional grammatical errors and slightly unnatural phrasing that affect fluency. With a few revisions to gender agreement and sentence structure, the text would read like a native‑speaker script. Overall, it is a strong translation that effectively communicates the concepts to a Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
