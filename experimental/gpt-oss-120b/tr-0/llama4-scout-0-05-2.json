  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and the flow of ideas follows the original script. Most sentences are understandable, and complex concepts such as transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in simple language. Minor hiccups (e.g., occasional abrupt switches between formal *usted* and informal *tú*, and a slightly clunky phrasing in “Usted lo ha entendido todo”) prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly naturally, but there are several awkward constructions: “Usted lo ha entendido todo” sounds stiff, “el ajuste” is a literal translation of *fine‑tuning* that native speakers would usually render as *ajuste fino*, and the mix of formal and informal pronouns creates inconsistency. These issues reduce fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is handled well. Key terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL* and *grounding* (anclaje) are correctly translated and consistently used. The only slight drawback is the use of “el ajuste” instead of the more precise *ajuste fino*.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original podcast are preserved, but the translation sometimes adopts a too‑formal register for a conversational podcast (e.g., the use of *usted*). A more consistent informal style would better match the target audience, though the overall message remains intact.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the explanations remain faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and is mostly easy to understand. It suffers from occasional register mismatches and a few unnatural phrasing choices that affect fluency and readability, but the technical terminology is solid and no information is lost. With minor stylistic adjustments the text would be fully natural for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience.\nOverall score (out of 100): 82/100."
