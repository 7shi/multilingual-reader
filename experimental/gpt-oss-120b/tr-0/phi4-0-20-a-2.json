  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured, and complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained with simple analogies. A few minor typographic issues (missing space after «Tech Éclair») do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native Spanish speaker. Most expressions are idiomatic, but a couple feel slightly forced (e.g., “funciones de memorización son una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje automático en contexto” and “una hoja de trucos”). Overall the flow is smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally handled well. “Preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto” and “ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)” are appropriate. The choice of “afinamiento” for fine‑tuning is understandable but less common than “ajuste fino”. “Anclaje” for grounding is acceptable, though “enraizamiento” could be another option. The terminology is consistent throughout.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator has adapted the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using culturally neutral language and keeping the podcast‑style tone. The analogies (consultant, student, bike‑riding) work equally well in Spanish.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is retained. No major ideas are omitted, and the nuances (temporary vs permanent knowledge, memory‑as‑a‑feature tricks) are preserved. The only slight loss is the nuance of “apprentissage en contexte automatisé” rendered as “aprendizaje automático en contexto”, which is still accurate.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the original message accurately, is easy to understand, and sounds natural for Spanish listeners. Minor improvements could be made in terminology (prefer ‘ajuste fino’ over ‘afinamiento’) and smoothing a few awkward phrases, but these do not detract significantly from the overall effectiveness of the translation.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17.6 ≈ 18/20."
