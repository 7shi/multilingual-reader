  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are mostly logical and the concepts are explained clearly. A few long sentences could be split for better flow, but overall a Spanish‑speaking reader can understand the discussion without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places. Vocabulary is appropriate and the style matches a conversational podcast. Minor awkwardness appears in phrases such as \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\" (could be \"ingeniosa\") and occasional over‑use of commas, but these do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, grounding, ventana de contexto, memoria) are rendered correctly and consistently. The translator kept the original English acronyms and provided Spanish equivalents where needed, which helps the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and tone of a friendly podcast. Cultural references are neutral, and the Spanish phrasing is adapted to sound natural for the audience. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., exclamation marks) are acceptable but not essential.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No important details are omitted, and the meaning of each segment is preserved. The translation is concise yet comprehensive.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational style of the podcast, and is readily understandable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Small stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but the translation is solid and faithful to the source.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
