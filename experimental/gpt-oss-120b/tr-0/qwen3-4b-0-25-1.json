    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the flow of ideas mirrors the original French. Most sentences are clear and the concepts are explained, but a few awkward constructions (e.g., \"es del bacho\") interrupt comprehension and force the reader to pause.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several noticeable lapses: \"es del bacho\" is not a Spanish expression, some punctuation is missing, and occasional literal translations (e.g., keeping \"fine‑tuning\" in English) feel out‑of‑place. Overall a native speaker would notice the oddities.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely preserved and appropriate: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding (anclaje), etc. The term \"fine‑tuning\" is left in English, which is acceptable in a tech context, and the translation is consistent throughout.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator kept the original intent and tone, adapting cultural references for a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, the phrase \"es del bacho\" fails to convey the intended meaning of \"bachotage\" and may confuse readers. Apart from that, the adaptation is adequate.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is retained. Minor redundancies (e.g., repeated explanations of \"memoria\") do not detract from completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content and overall narrative of the podcast. It is comprehensive and mostly clear, but a few linguistic slips—most notably the inexplicable \"es del bacho\"—reduce its naturalness and readability. Refining those awkward phrases and ensuring consistent use of Spanish idioms would raise the quality considerably.\nOverall score (out of 100): 75/100.\nScore breakdown: Readability 14, Fluency 13, Terminology 16, Contextual Adaptation 14, Information Completeness 18."
