  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured, the flow of the podcast dialogue is preserved, and complex concepts are explained in a way that a Spanish‑speaking audience can understand. A few minor punctuation issues do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and the conversational tone matches the original. Slight awkwardness appears in the sentence with \"cheat sheet\" (an English loanword) and a mixed tense in \"le hemos proporcionado... justo antes de que empezara a hablarte\", which feels a little stilted.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, anclaje (grounding), etc. The only lapse is the retention of the English phrase \"cheat sheet\" instead of a Spanish equivalent (e.g., \"hoja de referencia\"). Overall, terminology handling is excellent.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, humor, and informal podcast style. Cultural references are neutral and appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor lexical choices (\"bambalinas\" vs. the more common \"entre bastidores\") are still understandable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present; no content has been omitted or added unnecessarily. The translation is faithful and concise, keeping the full dialogue intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational tone of the podcast, and is largely natural for Spanish readers. The main areas for improvement are the occasional retention of English loanwords and a few minor grammatical tweaks, but these do not significantly detract from the overall readability and correctness."
