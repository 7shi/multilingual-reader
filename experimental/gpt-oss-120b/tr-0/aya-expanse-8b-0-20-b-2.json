  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are conveyed clearly. Sentences are mostly well‑structured, and the explanations of concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino y aprendizaje en contexto are understandable. Minor issues (e.g., the stray \"¿qué es?\" after a sentence) slightly hinder flow, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward constructions and punctuation errors. Examples include \"¿qué es?\" placed incorrectly, the inconsistent name change from \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Tech Luz\", and occasional missing accents. These hiccups make the text feel a bit less smooth for a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are correctly rendered and used consistently. The occasional retention of the English acronym \"ICL\" is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue, adapting the content to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Cultural references are neutral and appropriate. The only notable deviation is the change of the podcast name to \"Tech Luz\", which is an unnecessary alteration and slightly detracts from fidelity.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present: pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memoria” features. No substantive content is omitted, though the name change mentioned above is a minor inconsistency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency and cultural fidelity could be improved by fixing minor punctuation issues and keeping the original podcast name. The translation would be easily understood by Spanish‑speaking audiences interested in AI concepts, but a light edit would raise its naturalness to a native‑level quality.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 16/20, Fluency 14/20, Terminology 18/20, Contextual Adaptation 15/20, Information Completeness 17/20. Total: 80/100.\n\nRecommendations: • Correct stray punctuation and the misplaced \"¿qué es?\". • Keep the original podcast name \"Tech Éclair\" unless a deliberate re‑branding is intended. • Review accent marks and ensure consistent use of Spanish punctuation for a smoother reading experience."
