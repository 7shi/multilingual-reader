  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the ideas are clearly expressed. Sentences are slightly long but the logical flow mirrors the original French script. A few minor prepositional errors (e.g., “bienvenido en” instead of “bienvenido a”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are occasional awkward constructions and punctuation issues (“¿?“, “el afinamiento…?”). Some verbs are not fully conjugated (e.g., “le presentar” instead of “le presenta”). These hiccups lower the overall smoothness for a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning”, “transfer learning”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”, “anclaje (grounding)”. The English abbreviations are retained, which is appropriate for a tech‑savvy audience. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are neutral and do not need adaptation. Minor stylistic tweaks could make the language feel more idiomatic for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience, but the core message is fully conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is lost, and the examples (e.g., consultant analogy, memory feature) are retained. Redundancy is comparable to the original, and no crucial details are omitted.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the technical concepts well. Readability and terminology are strong points. Fluency suffers from a handful of unnatural phrasing and minor grammatical slips, and a few prepositional choices could be refined. Nonetheless, a Spanish‑speaking listener would understand the episode without difficulty, and the technical depth is preserved.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 17/20."
