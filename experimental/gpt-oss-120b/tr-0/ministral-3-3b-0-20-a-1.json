    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the sentences flow logically. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, y aprendizaje en contexto are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can follow. Minor typographic choices (asterisks, guillemets) do not hinder comprehension, but a few long sentences could be split for easier reading.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most of the dialogue, but there are several spots where the wording feels slightly foreign or clunky: the retained French word *antisèche*, the use of French guillemets « », and occasional literal renderings (e.g., \"una cantidad significativamente menor de texto\"). These quirks prevent the text from being completely smooth for native Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)*, and *anclaje* are all appropriate Spanish equivalents and are used consistently. The inclusion of the original English abbreviations helps maintain clarity. No major terminology errors are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone of the podcast script. Cultural adaptation is mostly adequate, but the occasional retention of French punctuation and the word *antisèche* shows a missed opportunity to fully localize the text for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No sentences or ideas have been omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is preserved. The translation is complete and faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the technical content effectively. Readability and terminology are strong points, while fluency and cultural adaptation could be refined by removing residual French elements and smoothing a few literal phrases. With minor polishing, the Spanish version would read as a native‑level podcast script.\n\n**Final Scores** – Readability: 17/20, Fluency: 15/20, Terminology: 18/20, Contextual Adaptation: 16/20, Information Completeness: 20/20."
