  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the dialogue flows logically. Most sentences are easy to follow, and complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) are explained in simple language. A few long sentences and occasional punctuation issues make it slightly harder to read, but overall a native‑Spanish reader can understand without effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward constructions (e.g., \"El aprendizaje en contexto es aprender de memoria\", \"el AIC\" instead of ICL, \"memoria de uso único\"). Some word choices are literal translations that feel a bit stiff, though they do not break comprehension. The overall fluency is good but not fully native‑like.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"anclaje\" are appropriate. The only inconsistency is the typo \"AIC\" where the original acronym ICL should be kept, which could confuse readers. Otherwise terminology is consistent and suitable for the target audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral and thus require no major adaptation. Minor literal renderings (e.g., \"consultor brillante\") work fine in Spanish. Overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is retained. No substantive ideas are omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as the source. The only slight issue is the accidental acronym change, but it does not cause loss of meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the content accurately and maintains the educational tone of the original podcast. Readability and terminology are strong points, while fluency suffers from a few unnatural phrasing and a typo in the acronym. With minor editing to smooth out the language and correct the acronym, the translation would be near‑perfect.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16 out of 20.\nThe translation is solid and functional for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but a final proofread by a native speaker would raise its naturalness to a higher level.\n\nScore: 16/20"
