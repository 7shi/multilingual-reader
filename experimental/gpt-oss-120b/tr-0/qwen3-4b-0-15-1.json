  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally understandable and follows the structure of the original dialogue. Most sentences are clear, but there are several awkward phrasings that impede smooth reading, such as \"Hola y bienvenido en\" (should be \"a\"), \"Usted ha entendido todo\" (unnatural), and especially the mistranslation of \"c'est du bachotage\" as \"es aplastamiento\", which confuses the intended meaning. Minor punctuation issues also affect flow.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish sounds somewhat literal and at times stilted. While technical vocabulary is mostly correct, everyday expressions are occasionally off‑beat (e.g., \"es una memoria de uso único\", \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es aplastamiento\"). These choices make the text feel less natural to native speakers.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\", etc. The occasional mix of English (\"fine‑tuning\") with Spanish is acceptable in this context. The main flaw is the wrong rendering of \"bachotage\" as \"aplastamiento\", which misrepresents the concept of cramming for an exam.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and the pedagogical tone of the podcast. Cultural adaptation is modest but adequate; however, the literal constructions and the erroneous \"aplastamiento\" weaken the adaptation. Overall the message remains intact.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All sections of the original script are present, and no major information is omitted. The only loss is the nuance associated with the mistranslated term \"bachotage\", which slightly changes the meaning of that analogy. Apart from that, the content is complete.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transferring the technical content of the podcast into Spanish, preserving most terminology and the overall structure. Nevertheless, several literal renderings and a critical mistranslation of \"bachotage\" affect readability and fluency. With a few adjustments to idiomatic phrasing and correction of the problematic term, the translation would be much more natural and clear for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 13/20."
