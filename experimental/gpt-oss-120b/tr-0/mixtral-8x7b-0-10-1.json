  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are clear and the logical flow mirrors the original. Minor issues such as occasional long sentences and a few punctuation quirks do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural to a native speaker: the English word \"approach\" is left untranslated, gender errors appear with \"el IA\" instead of \"la IA\", and some phrasing is slightly literal (e.g., \"una antisèche\" kept as \"un 'preguntas y respuestas'\"). These reduce the naturalness despite overall intelligibility.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and the acronym \"ICL\" are correctly rendered. The occasional retention of English words like \"grounding\" is acceptable in a technical context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, adapting the explanation for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor cultural/language slips (gender agreement, untranslated English terms) slightly affect the adaptation, but the overall message remains intact.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant omissions or additions alter the content; the translation is complete and faithful.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical discussion accurately and is largely understandable. Fluency issues—mainly leftover English words and gender mismatches—prevent it from feeling completely natural. Terminology is precise, and no information is lost. With a few edits to correct the English insertions and gender agreement, the text would reach a near‑native level of quality.\nOverall score (out of 100): 85/100."
