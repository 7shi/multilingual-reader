  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the dialogue format is preserved, so a Spanish‑speaking listener can understand the concepts without difficulty. Minor long sentences exist but do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, with appropriate colloquial expressions for a podcast. A few terms (e.g., \"El afinado\" for fine‑tuning, \"preentrenamiento\" without hyphen) are slightly less common than the usual \"ajuste fino\" or \"pre‑entrenamiento\", but they do not break fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is handled correctly: \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\", etc. The terms are consistent throughout the translation and appropriate for the intended audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator kept the informal podcast tone, adapted greetings to Spanish culture, and retained the brand name \"Tech Éclair\" unchanged, which is appropriate. Slightly literal renderings (e.g., \"El preentrenamiento\") are acceptable, and no cultural misunderstandings appear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content clearly, uses mostly natural Spanish, and preserves the conversational style of the podcast. Minor lexical choices could be refined (e.g., using \"ajuste fino\" instead of \"afinado\"), but they do not detract from overall comprehension or accuracy. The work is faithful, fluent, and well‑adapted to Spanish‑speaking listeners.\nOverall score (out of 20): 18.4 ≈ 18."
