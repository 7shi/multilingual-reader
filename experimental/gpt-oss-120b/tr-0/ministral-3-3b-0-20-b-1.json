  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the structure of the original podcast script. However, there are several grammatical slips (e.g., \"las nuevas conocimientos\", missing accents) and a confusing placeholder sentence – \"Es decir, en otras palabras, esto es, o bien, o sea\" – that breaks the flow. These issues force the reader to pause, lowering overall readability.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural, but a handful are awkward or literal translations (e.g., \"una cantidad significativamente menor de texto en francés\", \"consultor brillante\"). The placeholder line is completely unnatural, and occasional missing punctuation/accents make the prose feel less polished.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly identified and mostly preserved: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje/grounding, etc. Minor inconsistencies appear, such as the gender agreement error in \"las nuevas conocimientos\" and varying use of bold/italics, but the terminology remains clear and appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and adapts the examples (e.g., \"consultor brillante\") well for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are minimal, so no major issues. The only drawback is the nonsensical placeholder sentence, which momentarily obscures the intended meaning.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent knowledge distinction, and the explanation of the new \"Memoria\" feature. No substantive information is omitted, though the placeholder line adds noise without adding content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content and overall narrative of the podcast. Terminology is mostly handled well, and the speaker’s conversational tone is retained. However, several grammatical errors, a glaring placeholder sentence, and occasional clunky phrasing detract from fluency and readability. With careful editing to remove the placeholder and fix the minor language mistakes, the translation would be strong.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 15/20."
