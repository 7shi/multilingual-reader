  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clearly expressed. Sentence structures are logical, and the complex concepts are explained in a way that most readers can understand. There are a few minor hiccups (e.g., “Vézlo:” instead of a more natural “Míralo” and occasional redundancy) that slightly hinder smooth reading, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several phrases that feel awkward to native speakers: “Le dimos solo una preparación justo antes de que ella empiece a hablar con ustedes,” “El afinamiento… es una forma astuciosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado,” and the use of “prompt” without adaptation. These issues make the text feel a bit stilted in places, though overall it flows well.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, memoria a corto plazo, etc., are correctly rendered. The occasional retention of English terms such as “prompt” is acceptable in a technical context, but a brief Spanish equivalent could improve consistency. Overall the term usage is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original intent and tone effectively for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are preserved, and the conversational style is maintained. Minor issues like the plural “ustedes” in a one‑to‑one podcast setting slightly break the natural register, but the overall adaptation is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and the translation does not introduce unnecessary redundancy. The content remains faithful to the source while being concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does an excellent job conveying the technical content of the podcast and maintains the original’s explanatory tone. Readability and terminology are strong, and the essential information is fully retained. Fluency suffers from a handful of awkward phrasings and occasional literal translations, which prevent a perfect naturalness score. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation that would be well understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience, requiring only minor stylistic polishing to reach native‑speaker fluency.\n"
