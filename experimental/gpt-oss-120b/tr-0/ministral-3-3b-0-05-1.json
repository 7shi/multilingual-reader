  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logical and the dialogue flows naturally. Minor typographical errors (e.g., \"las informaciónes\", \"los palabras\") slightly impede smooth reading but do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural to a native speaker, but there are occasional awkward constructions and mixed‑language insertions (e.g., keeping *pré‑entrenamiento* in French, using *crunchar* without explanation). These moments reduce the overall fluidity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered most of the time: \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\". However, a few terms remain in French (\"pré‑entrenamiento\", \"afinado\") and the handling of \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\" could be clarified. Consistency is good overall.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts the examples to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Cultural references are unchanged, which is appropriate. The use of the English slang *crunchar* may feel out of place for some Spanish audiences, but the tech‑savvy target audience will likely understand.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the dialogue structure is maintained. Minor wording tweaks do not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does an excellent job of transmitting the technical content and conversational tone of the original podcast. While a few lexical choices and minor typographical errors prevent a perfect score, the text is clear, accurate, and largely natural for the intended audience.\n\nStrengths: faithful rendering of concepts, good handling of technical terminology, preservation of dialogue dynamics.\nWeaknesses: occasional leftover French terms, small grammatical slips, and a couple of slightly forced expressions.\nOverall, it is a high‑quality translation that would be readily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners interested in AI topics.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 86/100."
