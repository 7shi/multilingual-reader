  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are easy to follow. Sentences are a bit long in places but do not impede comprehension. The analogy about “bachotaje” (studying for an exam) is clear for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor punctuation quirks (e.g., extra spaces before «olvidado») do not affect readability.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. A few expressions feel slightly stiff – for example “Es una excelente observación, y es crucial entender cómo funciona esto” could be smoother, and the use of guillemets « » mixed with Spanish quotation marks is a bit inconsistent. Nevertheless, a native reader would have no trouble.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *afinamiento* (fine‑tuning), *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto* (ICL), *anclaje* (grounding). English acronyms are retained in parentheses, which helps the reader. No major mistranslations of jargon.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast opening (“¡Hola y bienvenidos…”) and uses culturally appropriate phrasing (e.g., “empollarse”). It preserves the original tone—informative yet conversational—while respecting Spanish‑language norms. Minor inconsistencies in punctuation do not detract from the overall adaptation.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No substantive information is lost or added unnecessarily.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational style of the podcast, and uses appropriate Spanish terminology. A few minor stylistic tweaks could improve smoothness, but the text is fully understandable and faithful to the source.\nOverall score (out of 100): 89/100."
