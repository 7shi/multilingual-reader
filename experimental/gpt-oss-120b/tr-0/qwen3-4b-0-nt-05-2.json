    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original. Most sentences are easy to understand, but there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en…”, “Cuando usted afinan un modelo”) that can momentarily disrupt comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, yet several expressions are non‑idiomatic for native speakers (“Miren:”, “¡Hola y bienvenido en…”, “bachear para un examen”). Minor grammatical slips also affect the smoothness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and “grounding” are correctly rendered and consistently used. The only slight inconsistency is the verb form “afinan” instead of “afina”.",

    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The podcast tone and explanatory style are preserved. The translation adapts cultural references appropriately, but the preposition error in the opening greeting and a few literal translations (e.g., “prompt”) slightly reduce the adaptation quality.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present; no significant ideas are omitted or added. The content remains faithful while remaining concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original message accurately and keeps the technical depth required for a podcast about AI. Readability and terminology are strong points, while fluency suffers from a handful of non‑idiomatic phrases and minor grammatical errors. With a few stylistic tweaks (especially in the opening greeting and verb agreement), the text would read like a native‑crafted script.\n\nThe translation scores well on completeness and term handling, but it loses points on naturalness and occasional awkwardness. It is a solid, functional translation that would be easily understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI, though a final proofreading pass would improve its polish.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
