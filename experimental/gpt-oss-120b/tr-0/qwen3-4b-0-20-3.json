  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the logical flow of the original. Most sentences convey the ideas clearly, and complex concepts are explained. Minor issues such as the preposition error “bienvenido **en**” and occasional gender mismatches slightly impede smooth reading, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds somewhat literal. There are several awkward or unidiomatic constructions (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en…”, “Usted ha entendido todo”, “las conocimientos”). The mix of formal ‘Usted’ and informal ‘tú’ is inconsistent for a podcast dialogue. These flaws make the text feel less natural to native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely handled correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *ICL*, *anclaje*. The only slight lapse is the retention of the French word “antisèche” without translation, but the surrounding context makes its meaning clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and the educational tone of the podcast. However, it misses some cultural adaptation (e.g., using a more colloquial Spanish register, consistent pronouns). The literal style sometimes reduces the conversational feel expected in a podcast.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French source is present. No major ideas are omitted, and the explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, and memory features is intact. Minor nuances (e.g., the exact nuance of “grounding”) are slightly diluted but the overall content is complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full substance of the original podcast and uses appropriate technical vocabulary. Its main drawbacks are occasional unidiomatic phrasing, inconsistent formality, and a few minor grammatical slips. With a bit more polishing to improve naturalness and register consistency, it would reach a very high level of quality.\nOverall score: 16/20."
