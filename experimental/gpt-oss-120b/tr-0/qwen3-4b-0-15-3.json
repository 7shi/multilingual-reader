  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but several sentences are awkward or contain mistranslations (e.g., \"aplastamiento\" for \"cramming\", inconsistent use of formal \"Usted\" and informal \"tú\"). These issues slightly hinder smooth comprehension, though the main ideas remain clear.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are unnatural expressions and grammatical oddities (e.g., \"Usted ha entendido todo\", \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es aplastamiento\"). The flow is stilted in places, but a native speaker can still follow the conversation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, etc. \"Fine‑tuning\" is kept as \"fine‑tuning\" which is acceptable, and most jargon is preserved. Minor gaps (no explanation of \"prompt\") do not significantly affect understanding.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural adaptation is adequate, though the inconsistent register (formal vs. informal) and the mistranslation of \"cramming\" to \"aplastamiento\" reduce the natural fit for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present; no major ideas are omitted. The only drawback is the inaccurate rendering of a few concepts, which slightly alters nuance but does not delete content.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is faithful and contains all the necessary information, but it suffers from several fluency and readability problems, especially the incorrect translation of \"cramming\" as \"aplastamiento\" and inconsistent use of formal/informal address. Technical terminology is well‑handled, and the core message is preserved, making the text usable after a light editorial polish.\n\nStrengths: accurate conveyance of technical concepts, correct terminology, completeness.\nWeaknesses: occasional awkward phrasing, register inconsistency, a few mistranslations that affect clarity.\n\nA moderate revision would bring the score closer to a high‑quality translation.\n\nFinal total score (out of 100): 74/100."
