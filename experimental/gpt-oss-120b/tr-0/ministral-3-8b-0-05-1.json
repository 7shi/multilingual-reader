  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas without ambiguity, and complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia y aprendizaje en contexto are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can understand. A few sentences are long, but they remain comprehensible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native speaker overall. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. Minor awkwardness appears in places like “las informaciones” (normally singular “la información”) and the repeated use of asterisks for emphasis, but these do not break the flow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"grounding\" are all rendered accurately and consistently. The English words *prompt* and *fine‑tuning* are kept where appropriate, aiding readers familiar with the field.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style of the podcast script. Cultural references are minimal, and the few retained French terms (e.g., \"Tech Éclair\") are acceptable as proper nouns. Slight improvements could be made in idiomatic phrasing, but the adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No sections are omitted, and the explanatory details (e.g., the analogy of a consultant vs. a permanent expert) are fully retained. Redundancies are not introduced, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It faithfully reproduces the original content, uses appropriate technical vocabulary, and is generally readable and natural for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Minor stylistic tweaks could raise fluency a point or two, but the overall result is excellent and suitable for publication.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.4 → 18.5/20."
