  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally clear and the ideas are easy to follow. Sentence structures are mostly logical, but there are occasional gender mismatches (e.g., \"la preentrenamiento\", \"la afinamiento\") and a few awkward constructions that may slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds mostly natural, but several phrases are literal translations from French that feel odd to native speakers (e.g., \"dársela de cultura general\", \"Lee una cantidad masiva de datos\"). The use of French‑style guillemets and mixed English terms (prompt) is acceptable in a technical context but reduces fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are correctly rendered and consistent. The only notable lapse is keeping the French word \"ancrage\" instead of translating it to the Spanish equivalent (e.g., \"anclaje\" or \"enraizamiento\").",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the podcast format and uses a Spanish‑appropriate register. However, some French lexical items remain (\"ancrage\", guillemets) and a few expressions could be adapted more idiomatically for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Overall, the intent and tone are preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No relevant detail is omitted, and the flow of the dialogue is intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and retains the educational tone of the podcast. It handles most technical vocabulary well and keeps the structure of the dialogue. Minor grammatical slips, occasional literal phrasing, and the retention of a few French terms prevent it from being completely natural for Spanish readers, but the overall comprehension is not affected.\n\n**Strengths:** complete coverage of content, consistent use of technical terminology, clear exposition of complex ideas. **Areas for improvement:** adjust gender agreement, replace awkward literal translations with more idiomatic Spanish, fully translate all French terms (e.g., \"ancrage\").\n\nOverall, the translation is solid and functional, suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience with a modest polishing needed for native‑level fluency.\n\n**Overall score (average of criteria):** 17/20."
