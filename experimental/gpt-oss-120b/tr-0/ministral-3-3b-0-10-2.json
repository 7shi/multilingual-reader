  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand and follows the logical flow of the original dialogue. Most sentences are clear, and complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino y aprendizaje en contexto are explained in plain language. However, there is a confusing placeholder line (\"Es decir, en otras palabras, esto es, o bien, o sea\") and a few typographical errors (e.g., \"informaciónes\"). These issues slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several expressions feel awkward or literal. Phrases like \"Es decir, en otras palabras, esto es, o bien, o sea\" are unnatural, and the occasional typo (“informaciónes”) breaks the flow. Overall, a native speaker would understand it, but the rhythm is uneven.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: key terms are kept in Spanish with the original English in parentheses (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje). The only minor lapse is the use of the anglicism \"crunchar\", which is not common in Spanish technical discourse, but the surrounding explanation compensates for it.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the intent and tone of the podcast script and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., \"bachotaje\" for cramming). The strange placeholder line and a few literal renderings detract from full adaptation, but overall the message is conveyed effectively to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All substantive information from the original French is present: the distinction between pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto, the analogy of temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of \"memoria\" features. No major content is omitted, and the translation does not add irrelevant material.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content and conversational style of the original French podcast. It is understandable and mostly natural, with accurate handling of most technical terms. The main drawbacks are a few awkward phrases, typographical errors, and the inclusion of an untranslated placeholder that momentarily disrupts readability. With minor polishing, the text would be fluent and fully polished for Spanish‑language listeners.\n\n**Total score (out of 100): 75**"
