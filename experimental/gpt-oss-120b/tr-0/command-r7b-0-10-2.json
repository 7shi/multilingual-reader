  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the main ideas are clear. However, the over‑use of opening exclamation marks and occasional awkward constructions (e.g., “Cuando initiates una nueva conversación”, “starts con un contexto vacío”) slightly impede smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several Anglicisms (“prompt”, “memory”, “starts”) and mixed‑language fragments break the flow. The style is conversational, which fits a podcast, yet the literal translations of some phrases feel stiff.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinación”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto” and “ICL” are correctly rendered. Some terms are left in English (prompt, grounding) or inconsistently translated, which reduces consistency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent, informal tone and pedagogical approach are preserved. Minor cultural mismatches appear in punctuation style and the inclusion of English words that a Spanish‑speaking audience might expect to be localized. Overall, the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present; no major ideas are omitted. Minor phrasing glitches do not affect the conveyed content. The translation is complete and accurate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the podcast’s educational content and maintains the conversational spirit. Readability and completeness are strong points, while fluency and terminology would benefit from tighter localization—especially eliminating leftover English words and smoothing out the occasional clunky sentences. With a few refinements, the Spanish version would feel as natural as the original French.\nOverall score (sum of the five criteria): 75/100.\nOverall rating: 15/20 if averaged across criteria, indicating a good but improvable translation."
