  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. Sentence structures are logical, but there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., “La diferencia entre copiar para un examen y dominar realmente un tema ¿qué es?”) and the change of the podcast name to “Tech Luz” that can cause brief confusion.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but some phrasing feels forced or overly literal. Punctuations such as “¡Es el aprendizaje en contexto en acción!” and the misplaced question mark reduce the smoothness. Overall a native speaker would understand it without difficulty, yet the flow is not completely native‑like.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje, etc. The translations are consistent and appropriate for the target audience. No critical term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience, preserving the original intent and tone. The only notable deviation is the renaming of the podcast to “Tech Luz,” which is unnecessary and slightly alters the brand identity. Apart from that, cultural references are well‑adjusted.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original script is retained. The only minor omission is the exact original podcast name at the close, which is changed to “Tech Luz.” No substantive content is lost, and the translation remains comprehensive.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and is largely understandable. Technical terminology is well‑translated and consistent. Minor issues with fluency, a few awkward sentences, and the unnecessary change of the podcast name prevent it from being perfect, but the overall quality is high and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nScore: 85/100 (sum of the five criteria)."
