  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow, sentences are logically ordered and complex concepts are explained clearly. Minor hiccups such as occasional long sentences and a few less‑common phrasing do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic, though there are a few slightly awkward constructions (e.g., “Se puede tener una conversación larga y detallada”) and minor inconsistencies in hyphenation (pre‑entrenamiento vs preentrenamiento). Overall fluency is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, anclaje, etc. The choice of “ajuste fino” for fine‑tuning matches common usage. Spelling of “preentrenamiento” is uniform enough not to cause confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the informal podcast tone, uses Spanish greetings and connectors, and adapts cultural references (e.g., “hola y bienvenidos”). The intent and purpose of the original dialogue are preserved without loss of nuance.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present. No sentences or ideas were omitted, and the supplemental explanations (e.g., about memory functions) are kept intact. Redundancy is minimal and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical discussion clearly, uses appropriate terminology, and retains the conversational style of the podcast. Minor fluency glitches prevent a perfect score, but they do not affect overall understanding. The work is faithful and well‑adapted to Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 88/100."
