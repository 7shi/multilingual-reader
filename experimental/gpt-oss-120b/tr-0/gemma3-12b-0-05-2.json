  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear, step‑by‑step manner that mirrors the original French. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto are explained with simple analogies that are easy to grasp for a general audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, but a few spots feel slightly forced or retain English words (e.g., “cheat sheet”). Phrases like “una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado” are correct but a bit heavy. Overall, a native speaker would understand it without stumbling.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding, etc. The occasional English loan (“cheat sheet”) could be replaced by a Spanish equivalent, but the terminology otherwise matches the source and the target audience’s expectations.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast’s conversational tone and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., “consultor brillante”). The only minor issue is the retention of a few English expressions, which does not break comprehension but slightly reduces the cultural fit.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present. No ideas are omitted, and the logical progression of the discussion is maintained. The only small loss is the untranslated English term, which does not affect the factual content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the original message accurately, uses appropriate technical language, and remains comprehensible and engaging for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor improvements could be made by eliminating the few remaining English words and smoothing a couple of heavier phrases, but these do not significantly detract from the translation’s effectiveness.\n\nFinal aggregated score: 90/100."
