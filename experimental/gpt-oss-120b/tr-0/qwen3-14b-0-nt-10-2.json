  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and easy to follow. The main ideas and analogies are preserved, and sentences are logically ordered. Minor issues such as the uncommon use of “el afinado” instead of the more usual “ajuste fino” slightly affect smooth comprehension, but the overall message remains understandable.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds mostly natural, but there are a few inconsistencies (e.g., mixing \"abres\" and \"empezáis\") and some literal translations that feel slightly stiff (\"una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\"). Punctuation with inverted exclamation marks is correct, yet overall fluency is a little uneven.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", and \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\" are appropriate. The translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"el afinado\" is understandable but not the most common term in Spanish technical literature, where \"ajuste fino\" is preferred.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The informal podcast tone is preserved, and cultural references (e.g., using \"consultor brillante\") are apt. Minor phrasing quirks do not detract from the intended conversational style. Overall, the adaptation respects the target audience’s expectations.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French script is retained. No notable omissions or additions alter the meaning. Redundancies are minimal and do not impede clarity.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and maintains the podcast’s conversational tone. While the terminology is mostly appropriate and the information complete, a few lexical choices and inconsistencies prevent it from being perfectly natural. Overall, it is a solid translation that would be easily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners, with room for minor polishing, especially regarding the translation of \"fine‑tuning\" and consistency in verb forms.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 16.8 → rounded to 17 out of 20.\n\nScore: 17"
