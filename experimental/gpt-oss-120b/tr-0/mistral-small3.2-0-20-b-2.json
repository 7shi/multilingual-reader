  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained clearly. A few sentences are a bit long, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, but there are occasional literal renderings that feel slightly stiff (e.g., “el afinamiento” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”, “una memoria de un solo uso”). Overall the phrasing is smooth and idiomatic for a native speaker.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely correct: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding → anclaje, etc. The only notable deviation is the choice of “afinamiento” for fine‑tuning, which is understandable but less standard. Consistency is otherwise good.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast tone, adapts cultural references appropriately, and uses Spanish‑appropriate expressions (e.g., “consultor brillante”, “examen”). No French‑specific idioms are left untranslated, and the title “Tech Éclair” is kept as a brand name, which is appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, no added content is unnecessary, and the flow remains faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality, conveying the technical content and conversational style of the original podcast clearly and accurately. Minor lexical choices (especially for “fine‑tuning”) and occasional literal phrasing prevent it from being perfect, but overall it reads naturally and retains all essential information.\n\nStrengths: clear exposition of complex ideas, consistent terminology, good cultural adaptation.\nAreas for improvement: use more common Spanish technical terms (e.g., “ajuste fino”) and smooth out a few long, literal constructions.\n\nOverall, the work is very solid and would be readily understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI topics.\n\nScore: 17/20 (average of the five criteria)."
