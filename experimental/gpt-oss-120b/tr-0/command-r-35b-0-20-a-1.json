    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow. Sentences are generally short and the flow of the dialogue mirrors the original French. However, a few awkward phrasings (e.g., \"El aprendizaje en contexto es como el 'bachillerato'\") and a mix‑language slip (\"cuando begins\") slightly hinder comprehension for a native reader.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation sounds natural, but there are noticeable non‑native constructions and occasional literal translations that feel stilted. Phrases such as \"del 'bachillerato'\" and \"Da la impresión de que realmente empiezan a recordar\" are less idiomatic. Overall, a native speaker would understand, but the text lacks the smoothness expected in a podcast script.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, grounding, ICL) are correctly rendered and consistently used. The translator kept the English acronyms and provided Spanish equivalents where appropriate. Minor issues: \"memoria a corto plazo\" could be clarified as \"ventana de contexto\" but the meaning is preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator generally preserved the original intent and tone, adapting the script for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Some cultural nuances (e.g., the analogy of a \"consultant\") are kept, but the \"bachillerato\" analogy is misleading in Spanish and may confuse listeners. Overall, the adaptation is adequate but not optimal.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key ideas from the French version are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of the \"memory\" feature. No significant information is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and keeps the structure of the original podcast dialogue. It is understandable and mostly faithful, but a few literal translations and non‑idiomatic expressions prevent it from feeling completely natural to a native Spanish listener. Minor corrections (e.g., fixing \"cuando begins\", replacing \"bachillerato\" with a more appropriate metaphor like \"estudiar a última hora\") would raise the fluency and readability scores.\nOverall score: 16/20."
