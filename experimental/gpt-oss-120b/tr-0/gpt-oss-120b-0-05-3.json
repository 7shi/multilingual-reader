  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured, and complex ideas such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, y aprendizaje en contexto are explained with simple analogías that a non‑expert listener can understand.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for native Spanish speakers. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. A few minor awkwardnesses appear (e.g., “consultor brillante” feels slightly formal, “chuleta” is colloquial but acceptable), but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is consistently rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding, etc. The English acronym ICL is kept with an explanation, which is suitable for the target audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural references are adapted (e.g., using “chuleta” for cheat‑sheet) and the conversational style fits Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No essential details are omitted, and the flow of the discussion remains intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, reads smoothly, and adapts the conversational style appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but they do not affect comprehension or correctness.\n\nThe translation scores well across all evaluation criteria, indicating a strong, faithful, and natural rendering of the original French script.\n\n**Overall Score:** 18/20 (average of the five criteria)."
