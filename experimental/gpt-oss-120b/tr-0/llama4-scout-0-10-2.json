  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are clear. Sentences are short enough to be easily followed, and the podcast‑style dialogue is preserved. Minor punctuation quirks do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but a few expressions are slightly literal (“el ajuste” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”, “ventana de discusión” instead of “ventana de chat”). These oddities are isolated and do not break the flow, so fluency is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, grounding → anclaje. The only slight inconsistency is “ajuste” for fine‑tuning, which could be more precise, but the meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original’s informal, educational tone to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogy of a consultant is preserved. No idioms feel out of place, making the intent fully conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No sentences are omitted or truncated, and the logical progression of the discussion is intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate, clear, and conveys the original podcast’s educational purpose effectively. Minor lexical choices (e.g., “ajuste” vs. “ajuste fino”) and a few slightly stiff phrases prevent a perfect score, but the overall quality is high and would be easily understood by Spanish‑language listeners interested in AI concepts.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 17.8 ≈ 18/20."
