  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the sentences are easy to follow. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia and aprendizaje en contexto are explained with clear analogies (graduado universitario, consultor, bachoteo). The occasional long sentence is still understandable, and the informal podcast tone is preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary (e.g., “chuleta”, “ventana de contexto”). Minor awkwardness appears in a few places, such as “El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotage” (the article placement) and “competencia permanente” (a slightly odd collocation), but overall the prose is smooth.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding → anclaje. When needed, brief explanations are kept, matching the original. The term “bachoteo” is less common than “bachillerato”, but the meaning is clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references (e.g., using “chuleta” for cheat‑sheet) and maintains the conversational, educational tone of the podcast. It respects Spanish‑speaking listeners’ expectations and does not retain French idioms that would feel foreign.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All salient points from the French script are present: the distinction between pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, the temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memoria” features. No important detail is omitted, and redundancy is minimal.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the original content faithfully, keeps the pedagogical analogies, and reads naturally for Spanish‑language listeners. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but they do not affect comprehension. Overall, it is an excellent rendering of the French podcast script into Spanish.\n\nScore out of 20: 18.5 (rounded to 18)."
