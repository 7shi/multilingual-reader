  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. Sentence structures are logical, and the flow of the dialogue is preserved. Minor issues such as occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., “aprendizaje a la vuela”) and inconsistent use of formal / informal pronouns slightly affect smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several unnatural expressions that betray a literal translation: “Usted ha entendido todo”, “aprendizaje a la vuela”, “antisèche”. The register switches between formal \"Usted\" and informal \"tú\", which feels odd for a podcast. Apart from these points, most sentences are grammatical and sound natural to a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely well‑handled: preentrenamiento, afinamiento (fine‑tuning), transferencia de aprendizaje, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding → anclaje. The only questionable choice is “antisèche”, a French loan that is not common in Spanish; a more natural term would be “chuleta” or “resumen”. Overall terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent, tone, and explanatory style of the podcast. However, cultural adaptation is imperfect because of the formal‑informal mix and idioms that are not fully localized (e.g., “a la vuela”). The core message is still conveyed accurately.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant content has been omitted or added, and the logical sequence of the dialogue is preserved.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in transmitting the technical content and the conversational spirit of the original podcast. It is mostly complete and uses correct technical vocabulary, but it suffers from a few fluency problems, register inconsistencies, and a couple of non‑idiomatic expressions. With a bit of polishing, especially in the colloquial register, it would read as a natural Spanish podcast script.\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 81/100."
