    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in the same order as the original. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia e ICL are explained clearly with examples, making the content easy to follow for a non‑expert audience. Minor hiccups (e.g., occasional use of the plural “informaciones”) do not significantly hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are a few awkward phrasings. Phrases like “las informaciones que necesita” and “las informaciones específicas” sound less idiomatic than the singular “la información”. The term “afinamiento” is understandable but less common than “ajuste fino”. Apart from these spots, the language is smooth and appropriate for native speakers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje, memoria. The choice of “afinamiento” instead of the more standard “ajuste fino” is acceptable but slightly off‑track for a technical audience. Consistency is maintained throughout the dialogue, and no critical term is omitted.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast’s tone and style to Spanish well. The opening greeting and the analogy of a consultant are preserved. The only notable change is the final rendering of the podcast title as “Tecno Relámpago” instead of keeping the original French name, which may affect brand recognition but makes sense culturally. Overall the intent and purpose are faithfully conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are lost, and the examples (English‑French transfer, consultant analogy, memory tricks) are retained. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy and keeps the length comparable to the source.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. Readability and completeness are strong, and the overall message of the podcast is preserved. Minor issues with lexical choice (especially the plural “informaciones” and the less‑common term “afinamiento”) and a small cultural adaptation of the podcast title prevent it from being perfect, but these do not detract significantly from the quality. With a few refinements to make the terminology more idiomatic, the text would read as completely natural Spanish for a technical audience."
