  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the concepts are explained clearly. Sentences are generally short and easy to follow, making the content accessible to a non‑specialist audience. Minor hiccups such as “partes de un contexto vacío” slightly affect smoothness but do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic (e.g., “consultor brillante”, “memoria de un solo uso”). A few constructions are a bit literal (“El pre‑entrenamiento.” as a stand‑alone line, “cuando abres una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío”) which feel slightly awkward to a native speaker.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL. The occasional retention of English acronyms (ICL, grounding) is acceptable in a tech‑focused podcast and does not cause confusion.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are neutral, and the examples (e.g., “consultor brillante”) are well adapted to Spanish‑speaking listeners. No mis‑alignments with target‑culture expectations are observed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is retained. No ideas are omitted, and the structure mirrors the source. The only minor redundancy is the repetition of the “memoria” explanation, which is present in the original as well.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains readable and mostly fluent, and respects the podcast’s explanatory style. Minor phrasing tweaks could improve naturalness, but overall the work is strong and faithful to the source.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.4 / 20."
