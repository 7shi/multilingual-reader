  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are clearly expressed. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje y aprendizaje en contexto are explained in simple terms, making the content easy for a non‑expert listener. A few sentences are long, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker. Most idiomatic expressions are well chosen (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", \"memoria de un solo uso\"). There are a couple of literal renderings (\"entre bastidores\" for \"behind the scenes\" and the use of the English word \"prompt\" without adaptation) that feel slightly awkward, but they do not break fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently and appropriately. The translator kept key English terms such as \"prompt\" and \"ICL\" which is acceptable for the target audience. Spanish equivalents (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, transferencia de aprendizaje, ventana de contexto) are accurate and used uniformly.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The tone of a podcast discussion is preserved, and cultural references are neutral, making the content suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. The analogy of a consultant and the comparison with studying for an exam are well adapted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No essential details are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, reads naturally, and remains faithful to the original intent. Minor literal choices prevent a perfect score, but the text is fully understandable and suitable for the target audience.\n\nStrengths: consistent terminology, clear explanations, good adaptation of the podcast style.\nAreas for improvement: smooth some literal phrasing and consider fully localizing occasional English loanwords like \"prompt\" for maximum fluency.\n\nTotal score: 92/100."
