    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and conveys the main ideas of the podcast. However, there are several minor grammatical slips (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en”, “Las conocimientos”, “una antiespia”) that slightly impede smooth reading. Overall, a native reader would understand the content without major difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "A number of expressions sound awkward or unidiomatic: “el afinamiento” (acceptable but less common than “fine‑tuning”), “es del bachotaje”, “una antiespia”, and punctuation issues such as extra spaces before exclamation marks. These reduce the natural flow, though the meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely preserved and correctly translated: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding → anclaje, etc. The occasional odd choice (“antiespia”) does not affect core terminology. Consistency is good throughout.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the conversational podcast tone, but some phrasing could be better adapted to Spanish (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en” should be “¡Hola y bienvenidos a”). Cultural references are neutral, so no major mis‑adaptations, yet the style could be smoother.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French script is present. No sections are omitted, and the logical sequence of the dialogue is retained. Minor redundancies or wording issues do not cause loss of meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full content accurately and retains the technical depth of the original podcast. Nevertheless, it suffers from several grammatical and stylistic errors that make the Spanish sound less natural. With a careful proofread and replacement of awkward phrases (e.g., ‘una antiespia’ → ‘una chuleta’ or ‘una hoja de referencia’), the text would reach a higher level of fluency and readability.\nOverall, the translation is solid in terms of completeness and terminology but needs polishing for native‑speaker fluency and style.\n\nScore: 80/100"
