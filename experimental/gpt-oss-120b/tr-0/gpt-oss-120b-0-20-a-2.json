  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Sentences are generally short enough for a podcast script and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained clearly. Minor punctuation quirks (e.g., the use of guillemets « » and an occasional missing accent) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but a few grammatical slips betray the literal French source: \"Cuando abre una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío\" should be \"parte\"; \"Se puede tener una conversación larga y detallada\" is acceptable but slightly informal for a scripted podcast; and occasional redundant articles (\"el modelo en sí mismo\") feel a bit stiff. These issues are limited and do not break the flow, but they keep the text from being perfectly idiomatic.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently and appropriately: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje (grounding)\" and \"memoria a corto plazo\" are all rendered with the standard Spanish equivalents. The occasional English abbreviation is kept, as in the original, which is suitable for the intended audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French tone to Spanish without losing the educational and conversational intent. Cultural references are neutral, and the examples (consultant, examen) are understandable to Spanish‑speaking listeners. A couple of literal renderings (e.g., \"una chuleta\" for \"antisèche\") are colloquial but fit the informal podcast style. Overall, the adaptation preserves the original purpose effectively.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No key ideas, examples, or nuances have been omitted, and no extraneous material has been added. The translation maintains the same structure and length, ensuring complete conveyance of the original content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and faithfully conveys the original podcast script. It explains the technical concepts clearly, uses appropriate terminology, and generally reads smoothly for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor grammatical errors and occasional literal phrasing prevent a perfect fluency score, but they do not affect comprehension. With a quick proof‑read to correct the few slips, the text would be near‑perfect for a professional podcast transcript.\n\nOverall score (average): 18.2/20"
