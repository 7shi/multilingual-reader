  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the flow of the conversation is preserved. Minor hiccups such as occasional long sentences or the use of French quotation marks (« » ) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most of the script. A few expressions feel slightly forced (e.g., \"¡Lo has comprendido todo!\" instead of \"¡Lo has entendido todo!\", \"consultor brillante\" is acceptable but a bit literal). The overall register matches a podcast tone, but occasional punctuation quirks reduce smoothness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje (grounding), memoria. The terminology is consistent throughout and appropriate for a non‑expert audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French podcast style to Spanish effectively, using familiar phrasing for the target audience. Small issues remain, such as retaining French guillemets and a few literal translations that could be more idiomatic, but the intent and tone are well conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original script is present. No content is omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as in the source. Redundancy is unchanged, preserving the original length and clarity.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical concepts clearly, maintains the conversational podcast vibe, and preserves the full informational content. Minor stylistic and typographic issues prevent a perfect score, but the text is both readable and technically accurate for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\nStrengths: accurate terminology, completeness, clear exposition of complex ideas. Areas for improvement: smoother idiomatic phrasing in a few spots and removal of French typographic marks.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18/20."
