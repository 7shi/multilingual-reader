  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences are clear, and the podcast style is preserved. However, there is a noticeable truncation after “Camille: Es decir, ¿”, which leaves a sentence unfinished and can confuse readers. Minor punctuation issues (missing commas, occasional over‑use of quotation marks) also slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few expressions feel awkward for native speakers: “Miren:” after a statement, “Ustedes han entendido todo” (a plural form that feels out of place in a two‑person dialogue), and the use of “afinamiento” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”. These choices make the text sound slightly stilted, though overall comprehension is not affected.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly. “pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and “anclaje (grounding)” are all appropriate. The only minor issue is the translation of “fine‑tuning” as “afinamiento”, which, while understandable, is less standard than “ajuste fino”. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal, conversational tone of a podcast and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., “consultor brillante”). The intent and explanatory style of the original are retained, making the content relevant for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor phrasing choices could be smoother, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present, including the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning, and the explanation of “memoria” features. The only loss is the incomplete sentence after “Camille: Es decir, ¿”, which omits a small piece of dialogue. No substantive factual information is missing.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast’s content and tone quite well, with accurate technical terminology and a clear structure. The main weaknesses are a truncated sentence and a few slightly unnatural phrasings that prevent it from feeling completely native. With minor edits to fix the missing line and polish the wording, the translation would be excellent.\nOverall score: 16/20."
