  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable; the sentences follow the original structure and the technical ideas are clear. A few long sentences and literal translations make the flow slightly heavy, but a native reader can grasp the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural: \"a puerta cerrada\" for \"behind the scenes\", redundant wording in \"Aprendizaje en Contexto, o ALC (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\", and inconsistent use of abbreviations (ALC vs ICL). These issues break the smoothness expected in native speech.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"grounding\" are correctly rendered. The main drawback is the inconsistent abbreviation (ALC/ICL) and the addition of \"inteligente\" to ICL, which is not in the source, but the core terminology remains accurate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts the conversational tone to Spanish (e.g., \"hola y bienvenidos a\"). Minor cultural mismatches appear in literal phrases like \"a puerta cerrada\". Overall, the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present. No major ideas are omitted; only minor stylistic inconsistencies (abbreviation usage) occur, which do not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical discussion accurately and is mostly clear for Spanish‑speaking listeners. It would benefit from a polish to improve naturalness—especially the handling of abbreviations, some literal idioms, and overly long sentences—but it is functionally sound and complete.\nOverall score (out of 100): 80/100."
