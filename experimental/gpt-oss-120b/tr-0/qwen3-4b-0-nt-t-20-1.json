    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but there are several awkward phrasings and minor typographical errors (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en”, “Apena aprende”, missing accents). The register shifts between formal “Usted” and informal “tú”, which can confuse readers. Nonetheless, the logical flow of the podcast dialogue is preserved, so a reader can follow the content.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound like literal translations from French rather than natural Spanish. Examples include “Usted ha entendido todo”, “Es una analogía perfecta !”, “bachotage” (a French‑Spanish loan that is not used in Spanish), and inconsistent use of “Usted/tú”. These reduce the smoothness of the text even though the overall meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding → anclaje are correctly rendered and consistently used. The word “prompt” is left untranslated, which is acceptable in a tech context. The only notable issue is the use of “bachotage”, which is not a Spanish technical term.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original podcast tone but fails to fully adapt it to Spanish‑speaking audiences. The mix of formal and informal address, the literal “en” instead of “a”, and the inclusion of French‑style expressions make the adaptation feel forced. Nevertheless, the intent and purpose of the original are conveyed.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original script is present; no major ideas are omitted. Minor typographical errors do not affect the factual content. The translation therefore retains full informational completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation conveys the content accurately and retains the technical depth of the original podcast. However, readability and fluency are hampered by literal renderings, inconsistent register, and a few non‑native expressions. Technical terminology is well handled, and no important information is lost, but a native‑speaker edit would be needed to make the dialogue sound natural and cohesive in Spanish.\n\nConsidering the scores across the five criteria, the translation earns an average of about 15/20, indicating a competent but improvable rendition.\n\n**Overall Score:** 15/20"
