  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the podcast‑style dialogue flows naturally. Minor punctuation quirks (e.g., missing period after “La diferencia entre repasar para un examen y dominar realmente un tema”) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native speaker. Most idiomatic expressions are preserved (e.g., “¡Exactamente!”, “¡Una analogía perfecta!”). A few constructions are slightly literal (“la expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo”), but they remain understandable and do not break fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, grounding, etc. The English acronyms are kept with Spanish explanations, which is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the original’s informal, educational tone and adapts cultural references (e.g., using Spanish punctuation « » and exclamation marks). The content is well‑suited to Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas, examples, and nuances from the French original are present. No substantial information is omitted, and the supplemental explanations are faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical concepts accurately, reads smoothly, and preserves the podcast’s conversational style. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but they do not affect the clarity or correctness of the content.\n\nStrengths: consistent terminology, clear explanations, faithful to source. Areas for improvement: smooth out a few literal phrasings and polish punctuation.\n\nThe translation earns a solid overall rating of 18/20.\n\nScore out of 20 points (overall): 18"
