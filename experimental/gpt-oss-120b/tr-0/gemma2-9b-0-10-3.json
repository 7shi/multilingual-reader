  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas mirrors the original French script. Concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia e ICL are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can follow. Some sentences are long, but they remain comprehensible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly naturally, but there are a few awkward or unidiomatic choices: \"El preentrenamiento.\" as a standalone line, the use of \"afianzamiento\" for fine‑tuning (the usual term is \"ajuste fino\"), \"fundamentación\" for grounding (more common would be \"anclaje\"), and a clear typo \"los palabras\". These hiccups lower the overall smoothness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely preserved, but some terms are rendered with non‑standard equivalents (e.g., \"afianzamiento\" instead of \"afinamiento\"/\"ajuste fino\"). \"Ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are good. The acronym ICL is kept, which is appropriate. The occasional mismatch prevents a perfect score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and adapts the conversational tone to Spanish well. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogy of a consultant is kept. Minor literal translations (e.g., \"consultor brillante\") are acceptable, but the unnatural term choices noted in fluency slightly affect adaptation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the sequence of explanations is intact. The only loss is the small typo, which does not affect factual completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. Readability and completeness are strong, while fluency and terminology suffer from a few non‑standard word choices and a typo. With minor revisions—especially replacing \"afianzamiento\" with \"ajuste fino\" and correcting \"los palabras\"—the text would be near‑perfect for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\nFinal score (average of the five criteria, scaled to 20): 16/20."
