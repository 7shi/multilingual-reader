    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are short and the logical flow mirrors the original French script. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained clearly. A few minor hiccups (e.g., the isolated line \"El preentrenamiento.\" and occasional over‑long sentences) slightly affect smoothness, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a conversational podcast, using informal second‑person pronouns and colloquial expressions like \"consultor brillante\". Some literal renderings feel a bit stiff – for example \"AIC (Aprendizaje In‑Contexto)\" instead of keeping the original ICL, and the repeated use of \"anclaje\" for \"grounding\" which is understandable but less idiomatic. Overall the language flows well with only occasional awkward phrasing.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"memoria a corto plazo\" are appropriate. The abbreviation change from ICL to AIC introduces a minor inconsistency, and the translation of \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\" is acceptable but not the most common term in Spanish AI literature (\"anclaje\" is used, but \"contextualización\" or \"vinculación\" could be more frequent). Nonetheless, the terminology is coherent and understandable for the target audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the original intent, tone, and did‑it‑yourself style of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral, and the informal register matches the Spanish‑speaking podcast listener. The use of \"tú\" throughout respects the conversational setting. No cultural mismatches are observed, and the adaptation even improves clarity in a few spots (e.g., \"memoria de uso único\").",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key points from the French script are retained: the distinction between pre‑training and fine‑tuning, the concept of transfer learning, the emergence of in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent knowledge debate, and the explanation of the new \"Memoria\" feature. No substantive information is lost; the only difference is the abbreviation change (ICL → AIC), which does not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational podcast tone, and is easy for Spanish‑speaking listeners to understand. Minor issues such as a slightly literal abbreviation change and occasional awkward phrasing keep it from being perfect, but these do not detract significantly from the effectiveness of the translation.\n\nThe translation succeeds in delivering the original message with clarity and appropriate technical language, making it suitable for the intended audience.\n\nScore: 17/20 (average of the five criteria)."
