  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original script. Most sentences are understandable, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can follow. However, there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., \"una nueva approach\", \"ancraje\" instead of \"anclaje\") and occasional missing accents that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds fairly natural for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate for a tech‑focused podcast, and the conversational tone is preserved. The main fluency issues are the occasional Anglicism left untranslated (\"approach\"), the slightly forced phrasing in some sentences, and a few minor grammatical slips. Overall the translation reads well but is not completely idiomatic.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje de transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"memoria\" are accurate. The only notable misstep is the translation of \"grounding\" as \"ancraje\", which is not the standard term (\"anclaje\" or \"fundamentación\" would be preferred). Consistency is otherwise good.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent, tone and educational purpose. Cultural references are neutral and appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor issues remain with leftover English words (\"approach\") and a few literal renderings that could be smoother, but the overall message is conveyed effectively.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present. No major ideas are omitted, and the explanations retain the same level of detail. The translation does not add unnecessary material, keeping the content concise while preserving completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and faithfully reproduces the content of the original podcast script. It succeeds in making the technical discussion accessible to Spanish listeners, and most terminology is correctly rendered. The main areas for improvement are eliminating residual Anglicisms, fixing the mistranslation of \"grounding\", and polishing a few clumsy phrasing choices. With those tweaks, the translation would reach a near‑native level of fluency and precision."
