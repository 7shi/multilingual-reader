  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are not overly long and the flow of ideas mirrors the original French script. The concepts are explained clearly, and the structure of the dialogue remains logical. Minor issues such as the repetitive parenthetical “ALC (Aprendizaje en Contexto)” slightly hinder smooth reading, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most of the text, using appropriate colloquial language for a podcast format. A few literal renderings feel slightly awkward (e.g., “Aprendizaje Contextual Inteligente (ICL)”, “el preentrenamiento” instead of a more common “pre‑entrenamiento”). The choice of “afinamiento” for fine‑tuning is understandable but less idiomatic than “ajuste fino”. Overall, the text sounds fluent with only occasional hiccups.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly translated: pre‑training → preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning → afinamiento, transfer learning → aprendizaje por transferencia, context window → ventana de contexto, grounding → anclaje. However, the translation of “fine‑tuning” as “afinamiento” is not the most common term in Spanish AI literature, and the handling of the acronym ICL (In‑Context Learning) is inconsistent – it is rendered both as “Aprendizaje en Contexto” and “Aprendizaje Contextual Inteligente (ICL)”. These inconsistencies lower the score slightly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator has adapted the dialogue to a Spanish‑speaking audience effectively. The informal, conversational tone is retained, and cultural references are neutral, making the content accessible. Minor redundancies (e.g., repeating “Aprendizaje en Contexto”) do not affect the overall intent. The adaptation successfully conveys the original purpose of explaining AI learning mechanisms.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No key points are omitted, and the examples (e.g., English‑to‑French transfer, memory feature) are fully retained. The translation is concise yet complete, with only negligible repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the original podcast script clearly to Spanish‑language listeners. Readability and completeness are strong, and the overall tone matches the informal, educational style of the original. Fluency and terminology are the main areas for improvement: using more idiomatic terms such as “ajuste fino” for fine‑tuning and keeping acronym usage consistent would make the text feel more natural to native speakers. Nevertheless, the translation effectively communicates the concepts without loss of meaning.\n\nOverall Score: 85/100"
