  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the sentences are easy to follow. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto are explained clearly, and the dialogue format is preserved. Minor hiccups (e.g., occasional redundancy) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural to native speakers. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. A few expressions feel slightly forced—\"AIC (Aprendizaje In‑Contexto)\" is an uncommon abbreviation, and some phrasing is a literal translation of the French (e.g., \"consultor temporal\"). Nevertheless, the text reads smoothly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\", etc. The only notable inconsistency is the use of the acronym \"AIC\" for \"Aprendizaje In‑Contexto\", whereas the standard abbreviation is ICL. This could cause confusion for a technically savvy audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original intent well to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogies (consultant, studying for an exam, learning to ride a bike) are preserved and sound natural. No cultural mis‑steps are evident.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is retained: the stages of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the explanation of the “Memory” feature. No major ideas are omitted, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content clearly, maintains the conversational tone of the podcast, and is largely fluent and natural. The main drawback is the unconventional abbreviation \"AIC\" for in‑context learning, which slightly harms technical precision. Apart from that, the work is accurate, readable, and well‑adapted to the target audience.\n\nOverall score (sum of the five criteria): 88/100.\n\nRecommendations: replace \"AIC (Aprendizaje In‑Contexto)\" with the more common \"ICL (aprendizaje en contexto)\" or simply \"aprendizaje en contexto\"; review a few literal translations for smoother phrasing.\n\nOverall rating: 88/100."
