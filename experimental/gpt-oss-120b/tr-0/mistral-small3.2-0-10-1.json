  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are mostly short and logical, and complex ideas are explained with simple analogies (e.g., consultant vs permanent expert). Minor fragmentary utterances like “El preentrenamiento.” are acceptable in dialogue and do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. A few expressions feel slightly literal (e.g., “competencia permanente” instead of a more common “habilidad duradera”, “memoria de un solo uso”), but they do not sound awkward.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding, etc. The translator kept the original English acronyms and provided Spanish equivalents where needed. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original podcast are preserved. Cultural references are neutral, and the examples (consultant, student, exam cramming) translate well. Slightly more Spanish‑style phrasing could be used in a few spots, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No notable omissions or added irrelevant content. The translation also keeps the structure of the dialogue, ensuring the same flow of ideas.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational style of the podcast, and is largely fluent and readable. Minor lexical choices could be refined for a more idiomatic feel, but they do not detract from the overall understanding. The work demonstrates solid competence in both languages and in handling technical terminology.\nOverall score (out of 20): 17.5 → rounded to 17."
