    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are generally short and the flow mirrors the original podcast dialogue. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto are explained clearly. A few minor hiccups (e.g., \"Lo olvida todo.\" is abrupt, but still understandable) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a conversational podcast. Most expressions are idiomatic (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", \"bachelor\" -> \"bachatear\"). There are a couple of slightly literal choices: the English loan‑word \"cheat sheet\" is left untranslated and \"ventana de contexto\" is acceptable but not the most common term (\"ventana de contexto\" is fine). Overall the language flows well for native speakers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled consistently. Key terms (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, transferencia, ICL, grounding, ventana de contexto, memoria a corto plazo) are correctly rendered and kept consistent throughout. The only small lapse is the untranslated \"cheat sheet\", which could have been rendered as \"chuleta\" or \"resumen\".",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the informal, educational tone of the original French podcast and adapted cultural references appropriately. The use of colloquial Spanish (“bachatear”, “consultor brillante”) fits the target audience. The only cultural adaptation missing is the English loan‑word \"cheat sheet\".",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and the logical order is maintained. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy and keeps the content concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the podcast’s conversational style, and is largely readable and fluent for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor issues such as an untranslated English term and a few slightly abrupt phrasings keep it from being perfect, but they do not significantly affect understanding.\n\nThe translator succeeded in preserving both the educational depth and the informal tone, making the material accessible to listeners who may not be experts in AI. With a small polish—especially translating the few remaining English loan‑words—the text would be fully natural.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 90/100."
