  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the dialogue flows naturally, making complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning understandable for a general audience. Minor hiccups (e.g., the retained English term “cheat sheet”) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for native speakers. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, and the conversational tone of a podcast is preserved. A few expressions are slightly literal (e.g., “es como bachatear”) and the English word “cheat sheet” is left untranslated, but overall the language is smooth and idiomatic.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled consistently and accurately: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (In‑Context Learning)”, “anclaje (grounding)”. The translator provides Spanish equivalents while keeping the original acronyms, which is suitable for the target audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French context to Spanish‑speaking listeners effectively. Cultural references are neutral, and the explanatory style matches a podcast format. The only slight lapse is the use of the English “cheat sheet” instead of a Spanish equivalent like “chuleta” or “hoja de referencia”.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original script is retained. No important points are omitted, and the logical progression of ideas (pre‑training → fine‑tuning → in‑context learning → memory tricks) is preserved. Redundancies are minimal and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the podcast’s engaging tone, and is largely natural for Spanish readers. Minor issues such as occasional anglicisms and a few literal renderings prevent a perfect score, but they do not affect the listener’s understanding.\n\nOverall score (out of 20): 19"
