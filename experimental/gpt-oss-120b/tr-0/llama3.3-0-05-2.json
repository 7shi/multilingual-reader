    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the explanations of complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are clear. The only hiccup is the truncated line \"Camille: Es decir, ¿\" which leaves the reader hanging, slightly breaking the flow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", \"ventana de contexto\"). Minor issues include the unusual hyphen in \"pre‑entrenamiento\", the inconsistent abbreviation \"AIC\" instead of \"ICL\", and a few slightly formal constructions (\"Usted lo ha entendido todo\"). These do not severely affect fluency but prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\". The only notable mistake is the change of the abbreviation ICL to AIC, which could confuse readers familiar with the original term. Overall terminology is consistent and appropriate.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural references are neutral and the analogy of a consultant is well rendered. The incomplete line slightly weakens the adaptation, but the rest of the script conveys the same message effectively.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, diferencia entre memoria temporal y permanente, y la función de \"Memoria\". The only omissions are the unfinished question from Camille and the incorrect abbreviation, which constitute minor loss of information.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is solid and faithfully conveys the technical content of the podcast. It reads smoothly, uses appropriate terminology, and keeps the original pedagogical tone. The main issues are a truncated utterance and an inaccurate abbreviation (AIC vs ICL). Fixing these two points would bring the translation to near‑perfect quality.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
