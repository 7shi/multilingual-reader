    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to follow. Sentences are mostly short enough and the ideas are conveyed clearly. There are a few typographical errors (e.g., “conocencias” instead of “conocimientos”) and occasional awkward phrasing that may force a reader to reread, but the overall comprehension is not hindered.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds fairly natural but contains several non‑idiomatic expressions: “afinado” for fine‑tuning, “bachear” for “cramming”, “bachear para un examen” and “es del bachotaje” are odd in Spanish. The misuse of “conocencias” is a clear grammatical slip. These issues lower the fluency, though most of the text reads smoothly.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is generally well handled – preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding → anclaje – are appropriate. The term “fine‑tuning” is rendered as “afinado”, which is understandable but not the most common translation (“ajuste fino”). Minor inconsistencies (e.g., “conocencias”) slightly affect precision.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the podcast tone and examples to Spanish‑speaking listeners effectively (e.g., “consultor brillante”). Cultural references are preserved and the overall intent is maintained. Minor lexical choices (e.g., “bachear”) feel a bit forced, but they do not distort the message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the ideas from the original French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory tricks, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. No significant information is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the content accurately and keeps the educational tone of the podcast. While the meaning is intact and the technical concepts are explained, the text suffers from a few non‑idiomatic word choices and typographical errors that affect fluency and readability. A careful proofread and a few adjustments (e.g., using \"ajuste fino\" instead of \"afinado\", \"conocimientos\" instead of \"conocencias\", and more natural verbs for \"cramming\") would raise the quality to a near‑native level.\nOverall score (average): 16/20."
