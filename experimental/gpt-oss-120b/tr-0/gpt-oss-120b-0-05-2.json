  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version presents the concepts in a clear, logical order. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the dialogue format is preserved, making it easy for a Spanish‑speaking audience to follow. A few sentences are long, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for native speakers. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic (e.g., \"chuleta\" for \"antisèche\"). Minor issues such as the hyphenated \"pre‑entrenamiento\" (more common as \"preentrenamiento\") and occasional overly literal renderings of French quotes are the only blemishes.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". English acronyms are kept, which matches usual practice. No key term is lost or mistranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references effectively (e.g., \"chuleta\" for cheat‑sheet). The tone of a podcast dialogue is maintained, and the explanations are tailored for a Spanish‑speaking audience without losing the original intent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original script is retained. No substantive content is omitted, and the added clarifications (like the meaning of \"chuleta\") actually aid understanding. Redundancy is minimal.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It faithfully conveys the original message, uses appropriate technical language, and reads naturally in Spanish. Minor typographic choices (hyphenation) and a couple of long sentences prevent a perfect score, but the work is excellent for both lay and technically‑savvy listeners.\n\nScore (average of the five criteria): 18/20.\n\nStrengths: clarity, consistent terminology, good cultural adaptation.\nWeaknesses: slight hyphenation inconsistency, occasional sentence length.\n\nRecommendation: a quick proofread to harmonize hyphenation would bring the fluency to a full 20/20.\n\nScore: 18"
