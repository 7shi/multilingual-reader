  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow. Sentences are mostly logical and the explanations of concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto are clear. A few long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but the overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward constructions: mixing English acronyms (AIC, prompt) with Spanish, literal renderings like \"ventana de contexto\" (acceptable but less common than \"ventana de contexto”) and \"sube en la silla\" (should be \"sube a la bicicleta\"). These hiccups prevent a fully native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, memoria a corto plazo, etc., are correctly translated and used consistently. The only minor issue is the introduction of the acronym AIC, which is not standard in Spanish literature (normally ICL or \"aprendizaje en contexto\"). Overall the terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural references are neutral, which is suitable. However, a few phrases feel literal and slightly off for a Spanish‑speaking audience (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", \"sube en la silla\"). Minor improvements could make the text feel more localized.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present. No key ideas are omitted, and the explanations remain intact. The only change is the acronym adaptation (ICL → AIC) which does not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency and cultural adaptation could be refined slightly. The text would be easily understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI, though a native speaker might notice a few literal turns of phrase and the occasional English borrowing.\n\nOverall quality: good, with room for minor polishing to achieve a fully natural podcast script in Spanish.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 80/100."
