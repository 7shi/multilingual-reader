    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained clearly. Minor punctuation issues (missing period after a sentence) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural for the most part, but a few constructions feel slightly awkward or overly literal (e.g., \"el aprendizaje en contexto es un estudio de memoria\", \"cuando abres una nueva ventana\" mixed with formal tone elsewhere). Vocabulary is appropriate, but the register fluctuates between informal \"tú\" and a more formal podcast style.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally well‑handled: preentrenamiento, ventana de contexto, grounding, ICL, etc. The translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"afinado\" is understandable but not the most common Spanish term (\"ajuste fino\" would be preferred). Otherwise consistency is good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts cultural references nicely (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", \"chuleta\" for \"antisèche\"). The intent and tone of the original podcast are preserved, and the Spanish wording respects the target audience’s expectations.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original script is present. No salient points are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is strong. It conveys the original content accurately, keeps the educational tone, and is mostly fluent and readable. Minor lexical choices (\"afinado\") and occasional stylistic inconsistencies prevent a perfect score, but the work is highly usable for Spanish‑speaking listeners of the podcast.\nScore out of 20 (average of the five criteria): 18/20.\nThe translation would benefit from a final stylistic edit to harmonise register and adopt the more common term \"ajuste fino\" for fine‑tuning, but it already meets a professional standard.\n\nOverall score (average): 18"
