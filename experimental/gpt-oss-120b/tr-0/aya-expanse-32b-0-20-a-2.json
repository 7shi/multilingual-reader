  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original ideas clearly and the sentence structures are logical. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in a way that Spanish‑speaking listeners can follow without difficulty. Minor issues arise from long sentences that could be split for easier reading, but overall comprehension is excellent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text mostly reads naturally, but there are a few awkward constructions and grammatical slips (e.g., \"Esta función de memorización son una forma…\" should be \"es una forma\", \"partes de un contexto vacío\" instead of \"empiezas\" or \"comienzas\"). Vocabulary choice is appropriate and contemporary, yet these small errors prevent a perfect fluency rating.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled consistently and accurately: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\" and \"anclaje\" are all appropriate. The translation also keeps the abbreviation ICL and explains it, which aids understanding. No major terminology mismatches were found.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts expressions to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the conversational tone of a podcast is preserved. Minor phrasing choices could be smoother, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant details are omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as in the original. Redundancy is minimal and does not affect clarity.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, accurately transmitting the technical content and the podcast’s conversational style. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency suffers from a few grammatical hiccups. Minor stylistic tweaks would bring it to near‑perfect level.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
