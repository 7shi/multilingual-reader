  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are short and the logical flow mirrors the original. Minor punctuation issues (missing opening ¿) and a few slightly clunky constructions (e.g., “partes de un contexto vacío”) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, but there are literal renderings and occasional awkward phrasing (“Mire, no enseñaría…”, “anclaje (anclaje)”). Vocabulary is appropriate, yet some expressions could be smoother.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL” are correctly kept. The word “prompt” is left untranslated, which is acceptable for a technical audience, but the parenthetical translation of “grounding” is missing (it appears as “anclaje (anclaje)”). Overall consistent but not perfect.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts it well to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are minimal, and the use of “Tech Éclair” is retained, which is appropriate for branding. Minor stylistic issues remain, but the overall message is preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the notion of temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No significant information is omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. Readability and completeness are strong, while fluency and terminology could be refined with smoother phrasing and more consistent handling of borrowed terms. Minor punctuation and stylistic tweaks would bring it closer to native‑speaker quality.\nOverall rating: 16/20."
