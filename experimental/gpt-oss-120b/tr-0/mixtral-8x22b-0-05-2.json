    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can grasp. A few minor clunkiness (e.g., \"aprendizaje automatizado contextual\") does not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Word choice is appropriate and the dialogue flow mimics spoken Spanish. Small issues appear, such as mixing English acronyms with Spanish explanations (\"AIC (Aprendizaje In‑Context)\") and a slightly awkward phrase \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje automatizado contextual\". These quirks keep the fluency from being perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled consistently: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, anclaje, memoria, etc. The translator sometimes chose a less common Spanish equivalent (\"afinamiento\" instead of the more frequent \"ajuste fino\"), but the meaning remains clear and the terms stay consistent throughout.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent, tone, and purpose of the original French podcast are well preserved. The translator adapts the style to Spanish‑speaking audiences, using idiomatic expressions like \"una analogía perfecta\" and maintaining the conversational feel. No cultural mismatches are evident.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original script are present: pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of the \"memoria\" feature. No significant content is omitted or altered.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains readable and mostly fluent, and respects the original tone. Minor stylistic refinements could improve fluency, but the translation serves its purpose well for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 18, Fluency 16, Terminology 17, Contextual Adaptation 18, Information Completeness 19. The average yields an overall rating of 18/20.\n\nOverall score (out of 20): 18"
