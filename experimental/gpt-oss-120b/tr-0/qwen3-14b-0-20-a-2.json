    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and follows the original logical flow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can follow. Minor typographical issues (e.g., missing accent in «¿Porque», missing space after the opening question mark) slightly impede smooth reading, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward or non‑idiomatic choices: «el afinamiento» instead of the more common «ajuste fino», «bacotaje» (a literal calque of «bachotage») which is not used in Spanish, and the colloquial «chuleta» that may feel out of place in a formal podcast script. Overall the language is understandable, yet the flow is occasionally stilted.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: «preentrenamiento», «aprendizaje por transferencia», «ventana de contexto», «aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)». The translation of «grounding» as «ancoraje» is acceptable though «anclaje» would be more usual. The term «fine‑tuning» is rendered as «afinamiento», which is understandable but not the standard term. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The informal, conversational tone of the podcast is preserved, and cultural markers such as Spanish punctuation (¡ ?) are correctly used. Small errors (missing accent, occasional literal calques) reduce the naturalness for native speakers, but the overall intent and style of the original are conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The content remains faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content and the lively podcast atmosphere into Spanish. While readability and completeness are strong, fluency and terminology could be refined by using more idiomatic expressions (e.g., ‘ajuste fino’, ‘memorización intensiva’ instead of ‘bacotaje’) and correcting minor typographical errors. Overall, it is a good translation that would be easily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners, but it would benefit from a final polish to sound completely natural to native ears."
