  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear order. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained with everyday analogies that are easy to follow for a non‑technical audience. Minor punctuation quirks (missing opening quotation marks, occasional missing accent) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are a few awkward constructions and terminology inconsistencies (e.g., \"Aprendizaje en Contexto, o ALC (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\" and later \"Aprendizaje Contextual Inteligente (ICL)\", as well as the missing space in \"¿Porque\" instead of \"¿Por qué?\"). These issues create brief moments of non‑native phrasing, lowering the fluency slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, etc. However, the abbreviation for In‑Context Learning is mishandled (ALC vs ICL) and the translation of ICL as \"Aprendizaje Contextual Inteligente\" is not standard. This inconsistency detracts from perfect terminology handling.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content well to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using appropriate cultural references and maintaining the podcast tone. The analogies (consultant, étudiant qui bachote, apprendre à faire du vélo) are kept and remain effective. No major cultural mismatches were found.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original script is retained. No significant ideas or examples are omitted, and the logical progression of the discussion is preserved. Minor redundancies are absent, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality, conveying the technical discussion in an accessible and engaging way. Minor issues with abbreviation consistency, a couple of small typographic errors, and a few slightly stiff phrasings keep it from being flawless, but the overall message and nuance are fully preserved.\nScore out of 20: 17"
