  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the explanations of complex AI concepts are clear. Sentences are generally easy to follow, though a few are long, which slightly hampers instant comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, using idiomatic Spanish. Minor issues such as the unexpected brand rename \"Tech Claridad\" and occasional literal phrasing (e.g., keeping \"prompt\") make it feel slightly less native.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, anclaje) are correctly rendered and consistent. Only the term \"prompt\" is left untranslated, which is acceptable for a technical audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The podcast tone and cultural references are well adapted for Spanish listeners. The only drawback is the change of the podcast name, which could confuse listeners familiar with the original title.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No relevant content is omitted, and the translation maintains the same structure and length.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the original content accurately, uses appropriate technical language, and maintains the conversational podcast style. Minor fluency issues and the renaming of the podcast title prevent a perfect score, but the translation is fully understandable and complete.\n\nTotal score (out of 100): 90/100.\n\nSuggested improvements: keep the original podcast name \"Tech Éclair\" or provide a clear explanation for any rename, and consider simplifying a few long sentences for better readability. Also, decide whether to translate or keep \"prompt\" consistently throughout the text."
