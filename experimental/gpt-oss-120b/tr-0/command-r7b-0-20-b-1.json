  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the main ideas and the logical flow of the conversation is mostly preserved. Most sentences are understandable, but occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., “¡Usted lo ha entendido todo.”) and mixed registers can momentarily disrupt comprehension for a native Spanish reader.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several non‑native constructions and lexical choices that feel forced: “afinar” instead of “afinación/ajuste fino”, “ancoraje” instead of the usual “anclaje”, the literal insertion of English words such as “starts”, and inconsistent use of “tú”/“usted”. These issues lower the naturalness of the text.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely correct (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, memoria a corto plazo). However, some terms are mistranslated or unconventional: “aprendizaje en contexto interno” deviates from the standard “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and “afinar” is not the usual verb for fine‑tuning. The inconsistency slightly hampers precision.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue, and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., keeping the informal conversational style). The change of the podcast name from “Tech Éclair” to “Tech Flash” is acceptable because it preserves the meaning. Minor register mismatches slightly affect the adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the substantive information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the examples (English‑French transfer, memory tricks) are kept intact. Only negligible redundancies appear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transferring the technical content and the conversational feel of the original podcast. It is fairly complete and accurate, but suffers from several fluency and terminology issues that make it feel less natural to native speakers. A revision focusing on consistent register, correct technical terms, and smoother phrasing would raise the quality considerably.\nOverall score (average): 14/20.\nScore: 14"
