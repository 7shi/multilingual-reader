  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are clearly expressed. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, y aprendizaje en contexto are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can follow. Minor hiccups (e.g., occasional very long sentences) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic, but a few spots feel slightly foreign‑derived, such as keeping the French word *ancrage* instead of using *anclaje* and the use of *afinado* for fine‑tuning. These do not break fluency but prevent it from being perfectly native.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)*, and *transfer learning* are rendered correctly. The only minor inconsistency is the retention of the French term *ancrage* and the choice of *afinado* for fine‑tuning, which could be more precise, but overall terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast tone and intent, adapting cultural references (e.g., renaming the show «Tecnología Flash»). It respects Spanish‑speaking listeners while keeping the technical depth. A small lapse is the untranslated French term *ancrage*, which could have been fully adapted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, no added or redundant content appears, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue closely.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, conveying the technical content clearly and maintaining the conversational podcast style. Minor lexical choices (e.g., keeping some French words and the translation of fine‑tuning) prevent it from being flawless, but they do not significantly affect understanding. Overall, the work is accurate, readable, and well‑adapted for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\nStrengths: faithful rendering of concepts, logical flow, appropriate technical vocabulary. Areas for improvement: replace lingering French terms with their Spanish equivalents and consider a more idiomatic term for fine‑tuning (e.g., *ajuste fino*).\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 92."
