  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow for a native speaker. Sentences are mostly short and the logical flow mirrors the original. Minor hiccups such as “Mira esto:” or the occasional long clause do not impede comprehension, so the text remains highly readable.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are a few literal renderings that feel slightly awkward (“el afinamiento”, “Mira esto:”, “ella lo olvida todo”). The gender agreement for \"IA\" switches between feminine and masculine, which is a small inconsistency. Nevertheless, the language is smooth enough for a native audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento (fine‑tuning)”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “ventana de contexto”, “anclaje (grounding)”. The translator kept the original jargon while providing appropriate Spanish equivalents, and terminology is consistent throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts idioms appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience (e.g., “consultor brillante”). Cultural references are neutral, and the speaker tone (podcast style) is preserved. A few literal French‑style constructions remain, but they do not hinder the message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is omitted, and the examples (English→French, consultant analogy, memory feature) are retained. Redundancies are minimal and the content stays concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does an excellent job of conveying the technical content of the original podcast while staying largely clear and natural for Spanish listeners. Minor stylistic and grammatical tweaks would raise fluency, but the terminology and completeness are strong. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for publication.\n\nStrengths: accurate technical vocabulary, faithful conveyance of concepts, good readability.\nWeaknesses: occasional literal phrasing, minor gender inconsistencies, a few spots where a more idiomatic Spanish expression could be used.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 17/20.\n\nRecommended action: a light proofread by a native Spanish speaker to smooth out the few awkward phrases and ensure consistent gender agreement for \"IA\"."
