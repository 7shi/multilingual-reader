  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are generally short and the logical flow mirrors the original French script. The concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained clearly, making the content comprehensible for a non‑expert audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, but a few word choices feel slightly off for native speakers (e.g., \"afinado\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\", \"Miren esto\" instead of \"Vean esto\", \"es del bachotaje\" which is a literal calque). These minor awkwardnesses prevent a perfect fluency rating.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\". The only inconsistency is the translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"afinado\"; \"ajuste fino\" would be more standard, but the meaning is still clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The podcast tone is well preserved in Spanish, with appropriate colloquial interjections and a conversational style that matches the target audience. Cultural references are minimal, so no major adaptation issues arise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is retained. No sentences are omitted or substantially altered, and the explanatory examples (e.g., the consultant analogy) are fully present.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is very good. It conveys the technical content accurately and keeps the lively podcast atmosphere. Minor lexical choices (especially \"afinado\" and a few slightly literal phrasing) prevent it from being completely natural, but the readability and completeness are excellent. The translation would benefit from a quick native‑speaker edit to smooth out the few awkward spots, after which it would be near‑perfect for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 89/100."
