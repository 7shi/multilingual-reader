  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow; sentences are logically ordered and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are clear. Minor issues like a few long sentences slightly reduce flow, but overall a Spanish‑speaking listener can understand without effort.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic, but there are a few awkward choices (e.g., \"el ajuste\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\", \"consultor temporal\" which sounds a bit literal, and occasional literal renderings of French expressions). These do not break comprehension but slightly affect native‑speaker smoothness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled expertly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje\" are all accurate and consistently used. The occasional retention of English acronyms (ICL) is appropriate for the audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast tone and intent, adapting the content for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Cultural references are minimal, so no major adaptation was needed. A few phrases remain overly literal (e.g., \"memoria de un solo uso\"), but the overall message is conveyed correctly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are retained: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and the simulated \"memory\" feature. No significant information is omitted or added unnecessarily.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality, conveying the technical content clearly and accurately while maintaining the conversational style of the podcast. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but the work is solid overall.\n\nStrengths: precise terminology, complete information transfer, clear explanations.\nAreas for improvement: smoother phrasing for some technical nouns and a slightly more idiomatic rendering of a few longer sentences.\n\nOverall score: 88/100."
