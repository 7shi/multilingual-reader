  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the main ideas are conveyed without heavy jargon. Minor punctuation quirks (excessive opening exclamation marks) and a few long sentences slightly hinder smooth reading, but overall a native reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part and captures the lively podcast tone. There are occasional awkward phrases (e.g., “ancoraje” instead of the more common “anclaje”, “el ajuste” instead of “ajuste fino”, and some inconsistent use of punctuation) that a native speaker would likely re‑phrase. Nevertheless, the language flows well and sounds conversational.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well‑handled: “preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)” are accurate. The translation of “fine‑tuning” as “el ajuste” is understandable but less precise than “ajuste fino”. The rendering of “grounding” as “ancoraje” is uncommon; “anclaje” would be preferred. Consistency is maintained across the script.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the original intent, tone, and podcast format, adapting the enthusiastic style to Spanish conventions (use of exclamation marks, informal address). Cultural references are neutral, so no mis‑alignment occurs. Minor stylistic choices (over‑use of exclamation marks) could be toned down, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No key points are omitted, and the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and the “memory” feature are fully retained. The translation is faithful and complete.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and faithfully reproduces the original podcast script. It is readable and mostly fluent, with only a few terminology and stylistic hiccups (e.g., \"ancoraje\", \"el ajuste\"). Technical concepts are correctly rendered, and the overall message and tone are preserved. Minor polishing would bring it to near‑native perfection, but as it stands the work is of high quality and fully informative.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 17/20."
