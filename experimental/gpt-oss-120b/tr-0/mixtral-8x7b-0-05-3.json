  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are clear. Minor issues such as occasional missing hyphens (\"pre‑entrenamiento\" vs \"preentrenamiento\") and a few long sentences slightly affect flow, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward constructions that betray a literal French‑to‑Spanish rendering. Examples include \"El IA\" (gender mismatch), \"no está constantemente afinando\" (should be \"no se está afinando\"), and the redundant phrasing \"Aprendizaje en Contexto In‑Context\". These hiccups make the text feel a bit stilted for native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. \"Fine‑tuning\" is rendered as \"ajuste fino\", \"in‑context learning\" as \"aprendizaje en contexto\", and \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\", which are appropriate Spanish equivalents. Acronym ICL is preserved and explained. Consistency is maintained throughout, and the level of explanation matches the intended audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original intent to a Spanish‑speaking audience effectively. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogy of a \"consultor brillante\" works well. A few literal translations (e.g., \"el IA\" instead of \"la IA\") slightly reduce cultural naturalness, but overall the message and tone are preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the logical flow of the dialogue is retained. Minor redundancies (such as the double definition of ICL) do not constitute loss of content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and retains the educational tone. While the technical terminology and completeness are strong, fluency suffers from a few literal renderings and gender errors. Improving those small language‑specific details would raise the overall naturalness of the text.\nOverall, the translation is solid but could benefit from a native‑speaker revision to smooth out the awkward phrasing and grammatical mismatches.\nOverall Score: 16/20."
