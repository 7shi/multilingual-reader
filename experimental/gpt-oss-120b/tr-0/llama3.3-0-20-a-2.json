  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. However, there is a noticeable truncation in Camille’s line (\"Es decir, ¿\") which leaves the sentence hanging, forcing the reader to guess the continuation. Minor punctuation issues (missing commas, periods) and occasional awkward phrasing slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few expressions are unidiomatic for native speakers (e.g., \"Ustedes han entendido todo\", \"consultor brillante\" instead of \"consultor destacado\", and occasional literal translations). There are also missing accents and some sentence constructions that feel stiff, reducing overall fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is well‑handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are all correctly rendered and used consistently throughout. The only minor point is that \"afinamiento\" could also be rendered as \"ajuste fino\", but the chosen term is still understandable for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of the podcast dialogue. Cultural references are neutral and appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The main drawback is the missing fragment mentioned above, which slightly weakens the adaptation of that specific turn.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas and explanations from the French source are present. The only loss of information is the incomplete sentence after \"Es decir, ¿\", which omits a brief clarification present in the original. No other substantive content is omitted, and no unnecessary redundancy is introduced.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is solid and conveys the technical content effectively. It demonstrates good grasp of the subject matter and uses appropriate terminology. The main issues are a missing fragment of dialogue, occasional unidiomatic phrasing, and minor punctuation/grammar slips. With a quick edit to fix the incomplete line and smooth out a few expressions, the translation would reach a higher level of polish.\n\nFinal average score: 16.4/20."
