    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but several sentences are awkward or contain mismatched registers (e.g., “¡Usted lo ha entendido todo.” vs informal tone of the rest of the podcast). Some literal translations such as “ventana de contexto” are fine, but others like “Aprendizaje en Contexto Interno” sound odd. Minor typographical errors (e.g., “starts”) also disturb flow.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are noticeable unnatural expressions and grammatical slips: mixing formal ‘Usted’ with informal ‘¡Lo has!’, use of English words inside Spanish sentences, and the uncommon term “ancoraje”. Overall the text reads as a word‑for‑word translation rather than a naturally spoken Spanish podcast.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly preserved (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, ventana de contexto, ICL). However, some terms are mistranslated or inconsistently rendered: “grounding” becomes “ancoraje” (the usual term is *anclaje*), and ICL is expanded as “Aprendizaje en Contexto Interno”, which is not standard. Consistency between “afinar” and “afinamiento” could be improved.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original French‑style phrasing and does not fully adapt to a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience. The mix of formal and informal pronouns, occasional English insertions, and the literal retention of the original brand name “Tech Éclair” (changed to “Tech Flash”) affect cultural resonance.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the original ideas, examples, and analogies are present. No major facts are omitted, and the structure mirrors the source script closely, preserving the educational intent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the essential content but feels like a literal, semi‑automated rendering. It is readable enough for a bilingual audience, yet several linguistic inaccuracies and unnatural phrasing prevent it from sounding like a polished, native‑level podcast script. Improving consistency of register, correcting mixed‑language slips, and using standard technical vocabulary would raise the quality substantially.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 14/20."
