    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear order. Most sentences are easy to follow and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are understandable for a general audience. A few minor punctuation issues (missing opening ¡ in some exclamations) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are occasional awkward turns that a native speaker would not use: \"el afinamiento\" (less common than \"ajuste fino\"), \"Se puede decir eso\" (more idiomatic would be \"Podríamos decir eso\"), and the word \"antiespia\" which is not a Spanish term at all. These hiccups reduce fluency slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL), \"anclaje\" for grounding, etc. The choice of \"afinamiento\" for fine‑tuning is acceptable though not the most common. No major mistranslations of technical concepts are present.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original podcast tone and adapts cultural references appropriately for Spanish‑speaking listeners. The analogy of a consultant and the use of informal conversational style are preserved. Minor issues such as the incorrect word \"antiespia\" (should be \"una chuleta\" or \"una hoja de trucos\") slightly weaken the adaptation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No important content is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and is generally clear and coherent. While the majority of the text reads naturally, a few lexical choices (especially \"antiespia\" and the handling of \"afinamiento\") feel off to native speakers, preventing a perfect score. Minor punctuation and style tweaks would bring the translation to a higher level of polish.\nOverall rating: 17/20.\n\nStrengths: faithful rendering of concepts, good readability, correct technical terminology. \nWeaknesses: occasional unnatural phrasing and a noticeable mistranslation of one word.\n\nRecommendations: replace \"antiespia\" with a proper term like \"una chuleta\"; consider using \"ajuste fino\" instead of \"afinamiento\"; smooth out a few idiomatic expressions for better fluency.\n\nScore: 17"
