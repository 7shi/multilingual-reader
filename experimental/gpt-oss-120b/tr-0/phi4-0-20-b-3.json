  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑expert can follow. Some sentences are rather long, but they remain comprehensible.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly sounds natural, but there are a few awkward or ungrammatical passages (e.g., \"Los nuevas conocimientos\" instead of \"Los nuevos conocimientos\", occasional redundant use of \"el\" before nouns, and a few literal renderings like \"el afinamiento\" that feel a bit stiff). These hiccups prevent it from being completely fluid.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑training → preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning → afinamiento, transfer learning → aprendizaje por transferencia, in‑context learning → aprendizaje en contexto, grounding → anclaje, etc. The acronym ALC is introduced consistently. The only notable mistake is the gender/number error in \"Los nuevas conocimientos\".",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the dialogue to a Spanish‑speaking audience well, preserving the informal podcast tone and the explanatory style. Cultural references are neutral, and the examples (e.g., consulting analogy) work in Spanish. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve flow, but the intent and purpose are fully conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No key idea is omitted, and the structure mirrors the source. The translation even adds a small clarification in a few places (e.g., \"en segundo plano\"), which does not distort the content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and faithful to the original content, delivering the technical explanation in a way that Spanish listeners can understand. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency suffers from a few grammatical slips and slightly stiff phrasing. With minor proofreading, the text would reach a higher level of naturalness.\n\nThe translation scores well on completeness and contextual adaptation, indicating a solid understanding of the source material and its target audience.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20.\n\nRecommendations: correct the gender/number error, consider using more idiomatic expressions for \"fine‑tuning\" (e.g., \"ajuste fino\"), and break up some overly long sentences to improve flow.\n\nScore: 17"
