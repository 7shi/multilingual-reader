  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained with clear analogies. A few sentences are long, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a spoken‑podcast style. Most expressions are idiomatic, but there are slight awkward spots such as “Mira esto” and the occasional literal carry‑over of English words like “prompt”. Overall the flow is smooth and appropriate for native speakers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL”, “anclaje (grounding)”. The few English borrowings (prompt, ICL) are kept unchanged, which is standard in the field. No major mistranslations are present.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original’s conversational tone and intent. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogies (consultor brillante, estudiante universitario) are adapted naturally to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve impact, but the core message is fully retained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the content from the French script is present. The only slight nuance loss is the translation of “bachoter” as “repasar”, which softens the original sense of cramming, but the overall meaning remains intact. No important information is omitted.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical concepts clearly, uses appropriate terminology, and maintains the informal, educational tone of the podcast. Minor stylistic and lexical adjustments (e.g., smoother connectors, consistent handling of English loanwords) would push the text from very good to excellent, but the current version is fully functional and understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20.\n\nScore: 18"
