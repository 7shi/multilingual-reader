    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the concepts logically and the explanations are understandable for a non‑expert audience. Minor issues such as the repeated use of *informaciones* (instead of the more natural uncountable *información*) and a few missing punctuation marks slightly affect flow, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places and uses appropriate vocabulary. There are a few slightly awkward constructions (e.g., \"Exactamente. Y este aprendizaje…\" could be smoother) and some informal slang like *chivatazo* that may feel out of place in a podcast script aimed at a broad audience. Overall, the fluency is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *ventana de contexto*, *grounding*, etc. Consistency is maintained throughout. The only minor drawback is the use of *informaciones* instead of *información*, which is a less common technical wording.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the content well for Spanish‑speaking listeners, including a culturally appropriate podcast title (*Tecno Relámpago*) and colloquial expressions like *empollarse*. The use of very informal slang (*chivatazo*) could be toned down, but overall the adaptation respects the original intent and tone.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key ideas from the original French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent knowledge distinction, and the explanation of “memory” features. No essential information is omitted, and the translation remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It faithfully conveys the technical content and the conversational tone of the original podcast, with only minor stylistic hiccups and occasional overly informal language. Terminology is accurate and consistent, and the adaptation to Spanish culture is thoughtful. A few lexical tweaks (e.g., using *información* instead of *informaciones* and moderating slang) would bring it to near‑perfect fluency.\nOverall score: 88/100."
