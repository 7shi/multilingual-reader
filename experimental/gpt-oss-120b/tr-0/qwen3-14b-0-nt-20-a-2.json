    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the dialogue clearly and the logical flow of the podcast script is preserved. Most sentences are easy to understand, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can follow. Minor typographical issues (missing opening exclamation marks) and a few awkward literal translations slightly hinder smooth reading, but they do not obscure meaning.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several expressions that sound unnatural to native speakers: “Usted entiende todo”, “El afinado”, “estos herramientas”, and the inconsistent use of formal / informal pronouns. Some punctuation typical of Spanish (¡ ! ) is missing. These issues make the text feel like a literal French‑to‑Spanish conversion rather than a natural Spanish narrative, though the overall meaning remains intact.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely handled correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *ICL*, *grounding* → *anclaje*. Where the original kept the French/English term (e.g., “afinado” for fine‑tuning) the meaning is still clear, and no crucial term is omitted or mistranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original French‑style register. While the intent and purpose are preserved, the adaptation to Spanish‑speaking audience could be improved (e.g., using more idiomatic phrasing, consistent pronouns, proper Spanish punctuation). Cultural references are neutral, so no major mis‑alignment, but the text feels slightly foreign‑lingual.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information present in the French script appears in the Spanish version. No sentences or key ideas are omitted, and the structure mirrors the source. Redundancies are minimal and do not affect clarity.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation accurately transmits the content and technical details of the original podcast, making it understandable for Spanish readers. However, it suffers from several fluency and stylistic issues that make it sound like a literal translation rather than a natural, polished Spanish script. Improving pronoun consistency, punctuation, and idiomatic phrasing would raise the overall quality considerably.\n\nScore distribution reflects strong completeness and terminology handling, moderate readability, but weaker fluency and cultural adaptation.\n\nOverall rating (average of the five criteria): 16.6 → 17/20.\n\nRecommendation: a light post‑editing pass focusing on natural Spanish expression would bring the translation to a professional level.\n\nOverall score: 17/20"
