  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clearly expressed. However, there are a few awkward phrasings (e.g., “simplemente aprende los palabras”, “afianzamiento” for fine‑tuning) and occasional mix‑language terms that can slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but some constructions are literal translations from French and contain minor grammatical slips. The use of uncommon words such as “afianzamiento” and the retention of French terms like “ancrage” break the flow for native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved (preentrenamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL). The translation of “fine‑tuning” as “afianzamiento” is not the standard term in Spanish (normally “ajuste fino”). The word “grounding” is left as a French term in parentheses, which is inconsistent. Overall the terminology is understandable but not optimal.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent, tone, and educational purpose are well conveyed. Examples and analogies (consultor brillante, aprender a andar en bicicleta) translate effectively. Minor cultural mismatches arise from the occasional untranslated French or English words, but they do not significantly affect comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the logical sequence is maintained. Minor redundancies are present, but they do not detract from completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the content and educational style of the original podcast. The main drawbacks are the non‑standard translation of some technical terms and a few grammatical slips that affect fluency. With a few adjustments (e.g., using \"ajuste fino\" instead of \"afianzamiento\" and fixing agreement errors), the text would read much more naturally for Spanish‑speaking audiences.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 75/100."
