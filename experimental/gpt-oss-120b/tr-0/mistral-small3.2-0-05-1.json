  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are clear and the dialogue flow is preserved. A few constructions (e.g., \"Vea:\" instead of a more natural \"Mire\", \"empollar\" for \"cram\") are slightly odd but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part and uses appropriate colloquial interjections (¡Exactamente!, ¡Una analogía perfecta!). Small awkward spots remain, such as \"es una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\" and the inconsistent hyphenation of \"pre‑entrenamiento\". These prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\". The only minor point is the occasional use of \"pre‑entrenamiento\" instead of the more common \"preentrenamiento\" and the choice of \"afinamiento\" over the more precise \"ajuste fino\". Otherwise, terminology is consistent and appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the original intent, tone, and conversational style. Cultural references are neutral and the language feels adapted to Spanish‑speaking listeners. The use of \"empollar\" may be less familiar in some regions, but overall the adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and no unnecessary repetitions are added. The translation faithfully conveys the full content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the original podcast script accurately, keeps the educational tone, and uses appropriate technical vocabulary. Minor stylistic and lexical tweaks (e.g., smoother connectors, consistent hyphenation, and possibly replacing less universal words like \"empollar\") would raise fluency and readability to near‑perfect levels, but the current version is already very effective for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.4/20."
