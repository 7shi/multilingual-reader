  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in a straightforward way. Minor punctuation quirks do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, and the dialogue flows smoothly. A few colloquial choices (e.g., “chuleta”) are informal but fit the podcast tone; overall there are no awkward constructions.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL”. The term “grounding” is left in English, which is acceptable because it is a niche term without a widely‑used Spanish equivalent. No important term is mis‑translated.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French context to Spanish‑speaking listeners, using idiomatic expressions (e.g., “da la impresión”, “consultor brillante”) and respecting cultural expectations. The overall intent and tone of the podcast are preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All relevant information from the original script is present. No sentences or ideas are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The technical explanations remain intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality. It conveys the original content accurately, maintains the conversational podcast style, and uses appropriate technical vocabulary. Minor stylistic tweaks could raise fluency a point or two, but overall it is a very solid rendering suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.4 / 20."
