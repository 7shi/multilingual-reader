  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the logical flow of the original. However, there are several awkward phrasing issues (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en”, “Las conocimientos”, “antiespuma”) that can momentarily confuse the reader. The overall comprehension is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound natural, but several stand out as unidiomatic: “bienvenido en”, “Simply utiliza”, “antiespuma”, and occasional missing accents or article mismatches. These reduce the smoothness expected from a native‑speaker translation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well handled: “preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL”, “anclaje”. The translation of “fine‑tuning” as “el afinado” is acceptable. The biggest lapse is the mistranslation of “cheat‑sheet” as “antiespuma”, which is not a recognized term.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast discussion. Cultural adaptation is adequate, but the odd terms mentioned above (e.g., “antiespuma”, “bienvenido en”) slightly break the naturalness for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the structure mirrors the source. Minor typographic leftovers (English word “Simply”) do not affect content completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core ideas of the podcast accurately and retains most of the technical depth. Readability and terminology are solid, but occasional unidiomatic phrasing and a few mistranslations (notably ‘antiespuma’) prevent it from being fully fluent. With some proofreading and correction of the few erroneous terms, the text would reach a native‑level quality.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
