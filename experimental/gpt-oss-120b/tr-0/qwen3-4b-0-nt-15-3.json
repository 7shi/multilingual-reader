  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure, but there are several typographical and grammatical slips (e.g., \"Apena aprende\", \"antiespesa\", missing accents, inconsistent spacing before punctuation). These hiccups force the reader to pause, slightly lowering fluency and comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the translation conveys the ideas, the language sometimes sounds unnatural to native speakers. Phrases like \"Apena aprende\", \"antiespesa\", and \"Se puede decir así\" are awkward. There are also occasional missing commas and odd capitalisation. The overall flow is acceptable but not fully native.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely well‑handled. Key concepts such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje\" are correctly rendered. The occasional retention of English words (e.g., \"fine‑tuning\" in parentheses) does not impede understanding, and the translation stays consistent throughout.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast tone and the explanatory style of the original. Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is needed. Minor issues (extra spaces before punctuation, slightly literal renderings) prevent a perfect score, but the intent and purpose are clearly conveyed.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the substantive points of the French script are present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the examples remain intact. Small lexical errors (e.g., \"Apena\" instead of \"Apenas\") do not remove information, though they slightly affect clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is solid and retains the educational intent of the original podcast. Technical concepts are accurately transferred, and the narrative flow is mostly preserved. However, a number of typographical and stylistic errors (such as \"Apena aprende\" and \"antiespesa\") reduce readability and naturalness. A careful proofread and minor re‑phrasing would bring the translation to a higher professional level.\n\nStrengths: correct handling of terminology, complete coverage of content, maintenance of tone.\nWeaknesses: occasional awkward phrasing, typographical mistakes, minor punctuation issues.\nRecommendation: revise the highlighted errors and smooth out the phrasing for a more native feel.\n\nFinal rating (average of criteria): 15/20.\n\n---\n**Scoring Summary**\n- Readability: 14/20\n- Fluency: 13/20\n- Terminology: 17/20\n- Contextual Adaptation: 15/20\n- Information Completeness: 18/20\n- **Overall Score:** 15/20**\n---\n**Reasoning**: Detailed reasoning for each criterion is provided within each sub‑object above."
