    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the logical flow of the original. Most sentences convey the intended meaning, and the technical concepts are explained clearly. However, there are several typographical and grammatical errors (e.g., \"conocencias\" instead of \"conocimientos\", agreement mistakes like \"las nuevas conocimientos\") that slightly disrupt the reading experience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds somewhat stilted in places. The switch between formal \"Usted\" and informal \"tú\" is inconsistent, and some expressions are literal translations that feel unnatural (e.g., \"Usted ha entendido todo\", \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es el bachotage\"). The presence of the French word \"bachotage\" and the awkward phrasing \"se le ha proporcionado una preparación justo antes de que ella comience a hablar con ustedes\" lower the naturalness for native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\", etc. The consistency is good. The main drawback is the retention of the French term \"bachotage\" without explanation, and occasional misuse of words like \"conocencias\". Overall, terminology is appropriate but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and purpose, and the examples remain relevant for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Nevertheless, the register is uneven (mix of formal and informal) and some cultural nuances (e.g., the informal podcast tone) are not fully captured. Minor adjustments would improve alignment with the target readership.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the flow of the dialogue is intact. Small grammatical slips do not cause loss of meaning, so completeness is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the content and technical concepts accurately, but it suffers from several linguistic inaccuracies, inconsistent register, and a few untranslated French terms. While a Spanish‑speaking reader would grasp the discussion, the text would benefit from a careful proofreading and stylistic polishing to achieve a more natural and cohesive podcast script."
