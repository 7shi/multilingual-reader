  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are conveyed clearly. Minor phrasing issues (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en…”, “Entrenamiento previo”) cause brief hiccups, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several awkward or non‑native constructions: inconsistent use of “preentrenamiento”/“Entrenamiento previo”, the literal borrowing “antisèche”, and expressions like “es del bachotaje”. The overall flow is acceptable but not completely natural.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly (ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto). Some inconsistency (pré‑entraînement) and the grounding translation (“anclaje (fundamento)”) could be refined, but terminology is understandable.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone. A few cultural‑linguistic mismatches appear (e.g., “hola y bienvenido en”, “antisèche”) that could be better adapted for Spanish‑speaking audiences, yet the message remains intact.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue content from the French source is present, with no omitted sections or loss of meaning. Redundancies are minimal.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full content and technical concepts accurately, but it suffers from occasional non‑native phrasing, inconsistent terminology, and a few literal borrowings that reduce naturalness. A careful edit to harmonize terminology and replace awkward calques would bring the text to a higher level of fluency and readability.\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 80/100."
