    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas are easy to follow. Minor grammatical slips such as “bienvenidos **en**” instead of “bienvenidos **a**”, occasional missing accents, and a few clumsy phrasing choices (e.g., “Ustedes han entendido todo”) slightly hinder smooth comprehension, but they do not prevent understanding of the concepts.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward constructions: “La integralidad del historial de su discusión” is unnatural, “Ustedes han entendido todo” feels formal and mismatched with the rest of the dialogue, and some verb forms are inconsistent. Despite these issues, a native speaker would understand the conversation without major difficulty.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled. “Pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (In‑Context Learning)”, and “anclaje (grounding)” are correctly rendered and used consistently throughout. No crucial term is mistranslated or omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Minor cultural‑linguistic mismatches (e.g., “Hola y bienvenidos en” and the shift between formal “Ustedes” and informal “tú”) reduce the naturalness slightly, but the overall message and register remain appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is lost or added, and the explanations remain faithful to the original. The translation is concise and does not introduce redundancy.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the technical content accurately and maintains the conversational style of the podcast. While the meaning is fully retained, the text suffers from a handful of grammatical and stylistic errors that affect fluency and readability. Improving those minor issues would raise the quality to a near‑native level.\n\nStrengths: correct handling of terminology, complete transfer of information, faithful preservation of intent.\nWeaknesses: occasional awkward phrasing, minor grammatical slips, inconsistent formality.\n\nThe translation is solid and functional, suitable for an informed Spanish‑speaking audience, but it would benefit from a final proofreading pass to smooth out the remaining rough edges.\n\nScore (out of 100): 84/100"
