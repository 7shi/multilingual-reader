  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is interspersed with bracketed editorial notes, justification paragraphs and unfinished sentences (e.g., “starts with”, “I see.”). These interruptions break the flow and make it hard for a Spanish‑speaking reader to follow the dialogue. Core ideas are still present, but the clutter severely hampers comprehension.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences are literal translations or awkwardly phrased (“la IA los utiliza para esta única conversación”, “Se olvida de todo”). There are English fragments, leftover French words, and inconsistent use of punctuation. The result sounds stilted rather than natural Spanish.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, ventana de contexto) are mostly rendered correctly, but some are inconsistently translated (e.g., “afinamiento” vs. “afinado”) and occasionally left in French. No systematic glossary is provided, yet the core jargon is understandable.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adds extensive meta‑commentary that would never appear in a podcast script, which distracts from the original intent. Cultural adaptation is minimal; the conversational tone is lost amid the explanatory notes.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "While most of the original dialogue is present, several portions are omitted or truncated, and the added justifications introduce information that was not in the source. Important nuances are sometimes missing (e.g., the exact comparison between “consultant temporary” and “expert permanent”).",
      "score": 6
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation attempts to be exhaustive by inserting justification notes, but this strategy backfires: the resulting Spanish version is cluttered, difficult to read, and far from the smooth, conversational style of the original French podcast. Technical terminology is generally correct, yet the overall presentation feels more like a draft translation commentary than a finished, listener‑ready script. Significant editing is required to remove the meta‑text, repair broken sentences, and restore a natural, fluid dialogue for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 6/20."
