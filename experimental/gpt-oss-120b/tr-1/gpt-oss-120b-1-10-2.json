  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow; sentences are logically ordered and the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are clear. Minor hiccups such as a slightly long sentence about the “espacio de trabajo temporal” do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. A few expressions are a little stiff (“Usted lo ha entendido todo”, “El aprendizaje en contexto es de empollar”), but they do not break the flow. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding, etc. When needed, the original English term is kept in parentheses, which helps the reader. No mistranslations of jargon.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original podcast script are preserved. Cultural references are neutral, and the translation adapts the style to a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience without losing humor or emphasis.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French version are present: the analogy of a graduate, the distinction between temporary in‑context knowledge and permanent fine‑tuned knowledge, the explanation of “memoria” features, etc. No important detail is omitted.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains readable and mostly fluent, and respects the original tone. The few slightly awkward phrases are minor and do not detract from the effectiveness of the translation."
