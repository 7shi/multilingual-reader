  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. However, the dialogue breaks at the point where Luc should explain the memorization feature – the line \"funciones de memorización\" appears alone, making the flow confusing. Additionally, pronoun usage switches between \"tu\" and \"vos/vuestras\" which can slightly hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural, but there are several awkward constructions (e.g., \"funciones de memorización\" as a standalone line, \"El modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de vuestras conversaciones\"). The mixture of informal and formal registers and the abrupt break reduce overall smoothness.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are correctly translated and consistently used. The English acronyms are kept, which is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts examples (e.g., \"consultor brillante\") well to Spanish. Minor cultural mismatches (use of \"vuestras\" versus \"tus\") and the missing explanatory segment after the memorization comment lessen the adaptation quality.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present, but the crucial explanation by Luc about how the memorization feature works is omitted after the broken line. This results in a slight loss of information, though the overall message remains understandable.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job conveying the technical discussion and uses appropriate terminology. Readability and fluency are generally good, but a significant glitch in the dialogue (the isolated \"funciones de memorización\" line) interrupts the flow and leads to a minor loss of information. With that correction and a bit more consistency in register, the translation would be near‑perfect for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience."
