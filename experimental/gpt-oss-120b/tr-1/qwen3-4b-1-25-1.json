  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable. Sentences follow a logical order and the main ideas are clear. Minor issues such as occasional overly long sentences and a few literal translations do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural to a native speaker (e.g., \"aplastar para un examen\" instead of \"empollar\", \"el afinamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\", \"anticipe\" for \"antisèche\"). These errors break the flow, although the surrounding text remains readable.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well‑handled: \"pré‑entraînement\" → \"preentrenamiento\", \"transfer learning\" → \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"In‑Context Learning\" → \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\". The choice of \"afinamiento\" for fine‑tuning is acceptable, though a note about alternatives would be ideal.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural adaptation is adequate, but the odd phrases mentioned above (\"aplastar\", \"anticipe\") feel out of place for Spanish‑speaking listeners, slightly weakening the adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present; no major ideas are omitted. The only loss is minor nuance caused by the awkward phrasing, but the factual content remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast content accurately and keeps the technical discussion intact. Readability is good, and the terminology is appropriate, but fluency suffers from several non‑idiomatic expressions that make the text feel stilted. With minor lexical revisions (e.g., using \"empollar\" instead of \"aplastar\", \"ajuste fino\" instead of \"afinamiento\", and correcting \"anticipe\" to a proper term like \"chuleta\" or \"apunte\"), the translation would feel natural to native Spanish speakers while preserving all technical details.\nOverall score: 79/100.\n\nThe main strengths are completeness and correct handling of technical terms; the main weakness is lack of native‑speaker fluency in a few key phrases.\n\nScore breakdown: 16 (readability) + 13 (fluency) + 17 (terminology) + 15 (contextual adaptation) + 18 (information completeness) = **79** out of 100."
