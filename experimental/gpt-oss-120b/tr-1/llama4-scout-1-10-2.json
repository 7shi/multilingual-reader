  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is difficult to follow. Several sentences are left in French or English, and placeholder marks such as “Spanish translation result” interrupt the flow. The mix of languages forces the reader to guess the missing content, breaking comprehension. Consequently, a Spanish‑speaking reader would struggle to understand large portions of the dialogue.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural constructions (e.g., “¿Porque ya entiende…?” without accent, “El pre‑entrenamiento” left in French, and the abrupt switch to English). Vocabulary choices are inconsistent, and the presence of untranslated French phrases makes the text sound fragmented rather than smooth.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto” and “aprendizaje en contexto” are rendered correctly, which is a strength. However, many terms are omitted when the original French line is not translated, and some French technical words (e.g., “fine‑tuning”) remain untranslated, reducing overall consistency.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent of the original podcast – explaining AI learning concepts in a conversational style – is largely lost because large sections are missing or left in the source language. Cultural references are fine, but the failure to provide a continuous Spanish narrative prevents the adaptation from resonating with the target audience.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Important explanatory passages are absent (e.g., the full explanation of “grounding”, the analogy about consulting, and the final concluding remarks). Placeholders and English insertions indicate that whole chunks of information were not translated, leading to a severely incomplete rendering.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is severely incomplete and inconsistent. While the technical vocabulary that was translated is generally appropriate, the frequent presence of untranslated French and English fragments, placeholder text, and missing sentences make the Spanish version hard to read, unnatural, and lacking key information. A thorough re‑translation, ensuring every line is fully rendered into fluent Spanish, is required to reach an acceptable quality level.\n\nOverall score (sum of the five criteria): 26/100."
