    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the original flow, but there are several awkward phrasings and grammatical slips (e.g., “las nuevas conocimientos”, mixed use of “tus” and “vuestras”, and the unnecessary insertion of an English meta‑commentary about sentence structure). These issues slightly hinder smooth comprehension for the reader.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural, but inconsistencies such as switching between «afinado» and «afinamiento», occasional literal translations (“el aprendizage en contexto es como hacer repaso para un examen”) and the mismatched pronouns make the text feel a bit stilted. Overall it is readable but not fully idiomatic.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning (afinado/afinamiento), transferencia de aprendizaje, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding (anclaje), etc. The main drawback is the inconsistency in the translation of «fine‑tuning» and a minor typo (“las nuevas conocimientos”). Otherwise the terminology is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts cultural references suitably. However, the inclusion of an English explanatory paragraph that does not belong to the dialogue breaks the immersion and reflects a lapse in contextual adaptation. Pronoun usage also fluctuates, which can be jarring for Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the substantive information from the French script is present; no major ideas are omitted. The only notable deviation is the extraneous English meta‑commentary, which adds noise rather than missing content. Minor typographical errors do not affect the conveyed facts.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning accurately and retains the podcast’s explanatory tone. Nevertheless, grammatical inconsistencies, term‑inconsistency, and the accidental inclusion of an English explanatory note reduce its overall polish. With some editing for consistency, gender agreement, and removal of the irrelevant paragraph, the text would reach a much higher level of quality.\nOverall score: 69/100."
