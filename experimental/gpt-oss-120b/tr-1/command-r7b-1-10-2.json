  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the main ideas and most sentences are understandable, but several constructions are awkward or contain leftover French fragments (e.g., “Exactement.”) and typographical errors (“conoscencias”). Phrases like “¿Qué es decir?” are unnatural in Spanish, which slightly hampers smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are numerous moments where the language feels non‑native: mixing French words, literal translations, duplicated parenthetical notes, and odd word choices such as “enracinamiento” for grounding. These issues break the natural flow for a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely preserved and correctly rendered (preentrenamiento, afinación, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, etc.). The only notable weakness is the use of “enracinamiento” instead of a more common Spanish term like “anclaje” or “acoplamiento”. Overall, the terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone of a technical podcast, but it fails to fully adapt culturally: French interjections remain, and some expressions are literal translations that feel out of place in Spanish. A better adaptation would replace these with idiomatic Spanish equivalents.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the core information from the French script is present; no major ideas are omitted. Minor issues such as duplicated parenthetical comments and a few typographical errors do not affect the factual completeness. The content remains comprehensive.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in transmitting the technical content of the original French podcast, but it suffers from several fluency and readability problems caused by literal translations, leftover French words, and occasional typos. Technical terminology is well‑handled, and no significant information is lost, yet a more careful edit to smooth the language and fully localize expressions would raise the overall quality considerably.\n\n**Strengths**: correct handling of technical terms, complete coverage of the source material.\n**Weaknesses**: non‑native phrasing, occasional French remnants, typographical errors, sub‑optimal choice for “grounding”.\n**Recommendation**: a thorough copy‑editing pass by a native Spanish speaker familiar with AI terminology would bring the score up to a professional level.\n\n**Total score (out of 100)**: 70"
