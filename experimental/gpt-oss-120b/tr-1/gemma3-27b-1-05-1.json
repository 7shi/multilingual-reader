    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can grasp. Minor issues such as the uncommon use of “afinamiento” instead of “ajuste fino” and a few slightly redundant phrases prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most of the dialogue, using colloquial expressions like “chuleta”. However, there are occasional awkward constructions (e.g., “atiborrarse de estudio”, “una cantidad masiva de datos en Internet”, retention of the English term “grounding”) that a native speaker would likely phrase differently. These quirks lower the fluency slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, ventana de contexto) are correctly rendered. The translation keeps “grounding” in English instead of using the Spanish “anclaje”, and uses “afinamiento” rather than the more standard “ajuste fino”, which may cause confusion for some readers. Overall terminology is adequate but not optimal.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and conversational style. Cultural adaptation is appropriate (e.g., “consultor brillante”, “chuleta”). The only slight drawback is the retention of a few English terms, but the overall message is conveyed effectively for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present. No relevant content is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary material. The dialogue remains faithful to the original script.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. Readability and completeness are strong, while fluency and terminology could be polished a bit (especially by using more idiomatic Spanish for certain phrases and by translating all technical loanwords). The overall quality is high, making the text suitable for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience, though a final proofreading pass would improve naturalness.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20.\n\nScore: 17"
