  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but sentence structures are often clunky and some fragments remain in French or English (e.g., \"Quand vous ouvrez une nouvelle fenêtre...\"). The mix of voseo and tuteo, and occasional abrupt inserts, disrupts the flow, making it harder for readers to follow the argument smoothly.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are numerous unnatural expressions: \"El afinamiento\" (instead of \"afinación\"), \"cuando afinás un modelo, modificás\" (inconsistent voseo), and literal translations like \"una chuleta\" for \"cheat‑sheet\" that sound colloquial in the wrong register. Some sentences are overly literal (“la IA no ha «olvidado» en el sentido humano del término”) and the translation includes meta‑commentary that does not belong to the podcast script, breaking fluency.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are mostly rendered correctly. However, the handling of some terms is inconsistent (e.g., \"el afinamiento\" vs \"afinación\", and the occasional retention of French words). Overall, the terminology is adequate but not uniformly applied.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to adapt the tone for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but cultural and linguistic adaptation is uneven. French fragments are left untranslated, and the switch between formal \"usted\" and informal \"tú\" creates inconsistency. The inclusion of explanatory notes about the translation process itself is out of place and detracts from the original podcast intent.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is present, yet several portions are either omitted or corrupted: French sentences left untouched, a meta‑explanatory paragraph about translation choices that does not belong to the source, and occasional missing connectors. The essential concepts are conveyed, but the extra noise and omissions lower completeness.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the core ideas of the podcast but suffers from significant linguistic and editorial flaws. Untranslated French fragments, inconsistent register, and the accidental insertion of meta‑commentary disrupt readability and fluency. Technical terminology is mostly correct, yet the overall adaptation feels unfinished. A thorough revision is needed to produce a clean, native‑sounding Spanish version that fully respects the original tone and structure.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 11/20."
