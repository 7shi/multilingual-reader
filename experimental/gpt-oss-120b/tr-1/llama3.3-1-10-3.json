  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable; the dialogue flow is preserved and the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are clear. Some sentences are long but still follow a logical order, so a reader can follow the argument without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several awkward or unidiomatic phrases: \"Hola y bienvenidos en\" should be \"Hola y bienvenidos a\", \"Ustedes han entendido todo\" is unnatural, and \"en la llamada\" is a mistranslation of \"en el prompt\". Minor punctuation errors (missing opening/closing quotes) also break the natural flow. These issues prevent the text from sounding fully native.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding, etc. Consistency is good, but the key term \"prompt\" is rendered as \"llamada\", which is inaccurate and could confuse readers familiar with the concept. Otherwise the terminology is appropriate for the intended audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone of a podcast conversation. Cultural references are neutral, and the explanatory style is maintained. Minor phrasing issues (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenidos en\") slightly reduce the naturalness for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present; no major ideas are omitted. The only loss is the precise term \"prompt\", which is replaced by a less accurate word, but the surrounding meaning remains intact. Redundancies are not introduced.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation conveys the content well and is largely faithful to the original. However, it suffers from several unidiomatic expressions and a critical mistranslation of the term \"prompt\". Improving these points would raise the fluency and technical precision considerably.\n\nScore out of 20 points (overall): 16"
