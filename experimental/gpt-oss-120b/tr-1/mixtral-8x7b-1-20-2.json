  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the dialogue clearly and the technical concepts are explained in a way that most Spanish‑speaking listeners can follow. Sentence structures are generally logical, but a few minor grammatical slips (e.g., “las nuevas conocimientos”) slightly disrupt the flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, but there are occasional awkward expressions such as “Mire:” instead of a more idiomatic “Vea:” and the mix‑up of gender in “las nuevas conocimientos”. The use of “el AI” instead of “la IA” is another small slip that would be noticed by native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”. The choice of “anclamiento (enlace)” for “grounding” is acceptable, though “anclaje” might be more common. Overall the terminology is consistent and appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using familiar expressions and even localising the podcast name to “Tech Flash”. Cultural references are preserved and the intent of the original is kept intact. Minor French‑style phrasing remains, but it does not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and nuances from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary repetition. The only minor deviation is the change of the podcast title, which is a reasonable localisation choice.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and communicates the technical discussion effectively. It is readable and mostly fluent, with only a handful of grammatical and stylistic errors that prevent it from being perfect. Technical terms are accurately rendered, and the adaptation respects the original intent while making the content accessible to Spanish listeners.\nOverall, the work is of high quality and would be well understood by the target audience, though a light proofreading pass could raise the fluency score.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16.6 ≈ 17/20."
