  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are clear and the flow mirrors the original dialogue. Minor issues appear, such as occasional overly long sentences and a few added explanatory remarks that are not present in the source, which can slightly distract the reader.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most of the text, but there are several awkward phrasings (e.g., “subes al caballo” instead of “subes en bicicleta”, “optimización” for fine‑tuning). Some grammatical choices feel forced, and a few expressions sound literal rather than idiomatic.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL), \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\". The biggest deviation is the use of \"optimización\" for fine‑tuning, where the standard Spanish term is \"ajuste fino\" or \"fine‑tuning\". This reduces precision.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the podcast‑like tone, but it introduces new content (extra explanatory sentences) and alters the original name of the show at the end (\"Tech Éclair\" → \"Tech Rápido\"). Some analogies are changed in ways that may confuse the original intent. Cultural adaptation is otherwise fine.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. However, the added sentences and the name change constitute minor deviations, and a few nuances are slightly altered, preventing a perfect score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core ideas of the original podcast and is mostly understandable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Nevertheless, it suffers from several inaccuracies in terminology, occasional unnatural phrasing, and some unwarranted additions or changes that affect fidelity to the source. Improving the choice of technical terms, eliminating superfluous explanatory insertions, and preserving proper nouns (e.g., the podcast name) would raise the quality substantially.\nOverall score: 70/100."
