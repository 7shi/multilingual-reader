  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the dialogue flows logically. Most sentences are easy to follow, and the technical concepts are explained similarly to the original. Minor issues such as the typo \"cramar\" and the uncommon word \"conocencias\" slightly hinder smooth comprehension, but they do not prevent understanding.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several unnatural expressions and grammatical slips (e.g., \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es cramar\", \"las conocencias\", \"copia para un examen\"). These make the translation sound slightly robotic and occasionally awkward for native speakers, though the overall meaning remains intact.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\", etc. The terms are consistent and appropriate for a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is required. However, a few idiomatic shortcomings (e.g., \"cramar\") reduce the natural fit for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is retained. No significant content is omitted, and the explanations remain complete. Minor lexical errors do not cause loss of meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full substance of the original podcast and uses appropriate technical language, but it suffers from several awkward phrasings and typographical errors that affect fluency. Improving those spots would raise the overall quality to near‑native level.\nOverall score (out of 100): 83/100.\nThe translation is solid in content and terminology, but needs polishing for natural Spanish expression.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 17, Fluency 14, Terminology 18, Contextual Adaptation 15, Information Completeness 19 = 83 total."
