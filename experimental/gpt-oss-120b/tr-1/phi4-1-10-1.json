  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is interrupted by a long, irrelevant explanatory paragraph about French grammar that does not belong in a podcast script. This breaks the flow and forces the reader to re‑orient. Moreover, a line from Luc is truncated to just \"Olvidado\", leaving the sentence unfinished. These gaps make the text harder to follow, especially for readers unfamiliar with the original. The overall comprehension suffers.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish sounds uneven. There are abrupt shifts in register (e.g., \"precisamente\" vs \"¡Una analogía perfecta!\"), mixed second‑person pronouns (\"tus\" and later \"vuestras\"), and some awkward constructions (\"Cuando refinás un modelo\" – regional and informal). The inserted French‑grammar note is completely out of place and reads like a technical comment rather than dialogue. These issues reduce naturalness.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\" (fine‑tuning), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are mostly rendered correctly. However, the term \"grounding\" is translated as \"ancoramiento\", which is acceptable but less common than \"anclaje\". Inconsistencies like \"refinás\" and occasional missing explanations lower the score.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent—to explain AI training concepts in a conversational podcast—is largely preserved, but the misplaced French‑grammar commentary and the abrupt truncation of a speaker’s line betray a failure to adapt the text to the target audience. Cultural nuance and consistent tone are also uneven.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original information is present, but crucial parts are omitted or cut off (e.g., Luc’s full explanation after \"Elle oublie tout\" is missing). The extraneous paragraph adds information that was not in the source, while some original nuances (e.g., the distinction between \"temporary\" and \"permanent\" knowledge) are less clearly expressed.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures many of the core ideas and technical vocabulary, but its quality is marred by a large, unrelated insertion of grammatical commentary, missing dialogue, inconsistent pronoun use, and occasional awkward phrasing. These problems impair readability, fluency, and faithful conveyance of the original podcast’s conversational tone. A thorough revision is needed: remove the extraneous note, restore the omitted sentences, harmonize pronouns and register, and fine‑tune terminology for natural Spanish usage."
