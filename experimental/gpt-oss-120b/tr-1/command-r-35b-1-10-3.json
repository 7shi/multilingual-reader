  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto) are understandable for a non‑expert audience. A few minor punctuation quirks (e.g., mixed use of quotation marks) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are occasional literal renderings that feel slightly awkward to native speakers: \"Imaginad\" (regional), \"Lee una cantidad ingente de datos\" (a bit stiff), and the inconsistent handling of English terms in parentheses. Overall the flow is smooth, but a few phrases could be re‑phrased for greater fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly appropriate: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (Aprendizaje In‑Context)\" are correctly rendered. The translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"especialización\" is understandable but less common than the standard \"ajuste fino\"; similarly, \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\" works but could be clarified. Consistency is decent, though the occasional retention of English words in parentheses is redundant.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is needed. The use of \"Imaginad\" reflects a European Spanish register, which is acceptable for the target audience. Overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No substantial ideas are omitted, and the logical progression of the discussion is retained. Minor typographic issues (missing hyphen in \"preentrenamiento\") do not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content clearly. Readability and completeness are strong points. Fluency and terminology could be refined by using more idiomatic expressions and the standard Spanish equivalents for some technical terms (e.g., \"ajuste fino\" instead of \"especialización\"). With these small adjustments, the text would read as a natural, polished Spanish podcast script.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 15.8 ≈ 16/20."
