  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and follows the original logical flow. Complex ideas such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto are explained in a way that a Spanish‑speaking audience can follow. A few sentences are slightly long, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward constructions (e.g., \"Lo habéis entendido todo\", \"El afino\" instead of \"el afinamiento\" or \"el ajuste fino\", and minor grammatical slips like \"una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje automatizado\"). These issues prevent the text from feeling completely fluid for native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely well‑handled: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, etc. The main flaw is the use of \"El afino\" which is not a recognized Spanish term for fine‑tuning, creating a momentary confusion. Otherwise, the jargon is consistent and appropriate for a lay‑person audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the informal podcast tone and adapts cultural references (e.g., \"estudiar a la carrera\" for \"bachoter\"). Minor idiomatic improvements could be made (e.g., using \"bachotaje\"), but overall the adaptation conveys the original intent and humor effectively.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the ideas and examples from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted, and the supplemental explanations (e.g., how the \"memoria\" feature works) are retained. The content remains concise without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the spirit and technical content of the original podcast very well. It is readable and faithful, though a few terminology slips (notably \"El afino\") and some slightly stilted phrasing keep it from being perfectly natural. With minor revisions to the problematic terms, it would be an excellent rendition for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20.\n\nScore: 16"
