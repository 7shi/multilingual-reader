  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is overall easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the dialogue format is preserved, making the content accessible. A few long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but comprehension is not hindered.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural in most places, using appropriate Spanish idioms (e.g., \"dar la impresión\", \"cramarse\"). Minor awkwardness appears in some word choices such as \"preentrenamiento\" (acceptable but less common than \"pre‑entrenamiento\") and the occasional literal translation of \"consultant temporary\" as \"consultor temporal\", which feels slightly forced.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\" for fine‑tuning, \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje\" for grounding. Consistency is maintained throughout. The decision to keep \"Tech Éclair\" unchanged is appropriate for a proper name.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French tone and analogies to a Spanish‑speaking audience effectively. Cultural references are neutral, and the examples (e.g., \"consultor brillante\") are understandable. Minor phrasing could be refined, but the intent and purpose are fully conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of the new \"Memoria\" feature. No significant information is omitted, and redundancy is kept minimal.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and communicates the technical concepts clearly to a Spanish‑speaking audience. While a few phrasing choices could be polished for greater naturalness, the terminology is accurate, the context is well adapted, and the content is complete. It serves the purpose of a podcast script effectively.\n\nOverall score: 85/100 (out of 100). The translation is high‑quality with room for minor stylistic improvements.\n\nScore Breakdown:\n- Readability: 16/20\n- Fluency: 15/20\n- Terminology: 17/20\n- Contextual Adaptation: 18/20\n- Information Completeness: 19/20\n- Total: 85/100"
