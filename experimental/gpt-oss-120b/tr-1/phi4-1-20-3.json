  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are clear. Minor issues such as occasional overly literal phrasing (“el pre‑entrenamiento” in lower case) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native Spanish speaker. Most idiomatic expressions are appropriate (e.g., “como el repaso para un examen”, “consultor brillante”). A few constructions feel a little stiff – “El afinamiento, por otro lado, busca crear una competencia permanente” could be smoother – but overall the flow is very good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento” (instead of the more common “ajuste fino”), “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (In‑Context Learning)”. Consistency is maintained throughout. The only slight drawback is the choice of “afinamiento”, which, while understandable, is less standard in Spanish technical literature.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator kept the original intent and tone, adapting cultural references (e.g., “consultor brillante”) appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. No expressions feel out of place, and the content is suitable for the target listeners of a tech podcast.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No key ideas are omitted, and the supplemental clarifications (such as the explanation of “ICL”) are retained. Redundancies are minimal, making the text concise yet complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content clearly, sounds natural, and respects the original podcast’s explanatory style. Minor lexical choices (e.g., ‘afinamiento’) and occasional slightly rigid phrasing prevent it from being perfect, but they do not detract from overall comprehension or usefulness.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 17, Fluency 18, Terminology 16, Contextual Adaptation 17, Information Completeness 19. Total: 87/100.\n\nOverall, the work is strong and would serve Spanish‑speaking listeners well, needing only small refinements for maximal polish.\n\nScore: 87/100"
