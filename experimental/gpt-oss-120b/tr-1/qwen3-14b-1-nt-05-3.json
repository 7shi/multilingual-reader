  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. However, there are a few hiccups that hurt smooth comprehension: the typo “crammar” (intended to be “bachotear”) is confusing, the standalone line “El preentrenamiento.” interrupts flow, and occasional French‑style quotation marks (« ») look out of place for Spanish readers. These issues prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several expressions are awkward: “Vean ustedes” is not a common Spanish phrase, “Por tanto,” is less idiomatic than “Por lo tanto,” and punctuation such as “¡Exactamente !” and the lingering French guillemets break the native feel. The overall register is appropriate for a podcast, yet the accumulated oddities lower fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Core terms like \"preentrenamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"grounding\" (rendered as \"anclaje\") are accurately translated and used consistently. The only minor point is the mixture of the English loan \"fine‑tuning\" with the Spanish \"afinamiento\", but this does not cause confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast tone and intent, adapting it to Spanish conventions (e.g., using «¡» and «¿» for questions and exclamations). Some French typographic elements remain, and a few English words are left untranslated, but overall the content feels appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key ideas from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant pieces of information are omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as the source. Minor stylistic redundancies are kept, but they do not affect completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical discussion clearly and keeps the conversational podcast style, making the material accessible to Spanish listeners. Strengths include accurate handling of technical terms and overall completeness. Weaknesses are mainly stylistic: a noticeable typo, occasional unnatural phrasing, and residual French typographic conventions that slightly disrupt fluency and readability. With minor edits, the translation would be excellent.\nOverall score (out of 100): 84/100."
