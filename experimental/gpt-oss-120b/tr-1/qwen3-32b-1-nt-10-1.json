  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but numerous typographical and formatting errors (e.g., duplicated speaker tags, a stray “Camille: we”, the fragment “Luc: - de l'ICL”, gender mistakes like *las conocimientos*) interrupt the flow. Some sentences are awkward (“Imaginen que se envía a una IA…”) and require the reader to re‑parse the meaning. These issues lower the overall ease of reading.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most sentences use correct Spanish vocabulary, the translation contains several unnatural constructions and clear copy‑and‑paste mistakes that a native speaker would never produce. The duplicated “Luc: Luc:” line, the abrupt “we”, and the inconsistent use of article gender make the text feel clunky and unpolished.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto* and *aprendizaje en contexto* are rendered correctly. However, the French word *préentraînement* appears once, and the term *fine‑tuning* is rendered both as *afinamiento* and *ajuste fino* without a clear choice, which introduces inconsistency.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast’s explanatory tone and overall intent. Nevertheless, the occasional mistranslations (e.g., keeping French words) and broken sentences dilute the cultural and pragmatic adaptation for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The bulk of the original content is present, but several fragments are missing or corrupted (e.g., the line where Camille says “we”, the garbled “Luc: - de l'ICL”, and some missing explanatory clauses). These gaps mean the reader does not receive the full set of arguments as in the source.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the main ideas of the French podcast and uses appropriate technical vocabulary for the most part. However, it suffers from serious editorial oversights—duplicated speaker tags, truncated sentences, inconsistent terminology, and occasional French remnants—that affect readability, fluency, and completeness. A thorough proofread and consistency check would be needed before this could be considered a high‑quality Spanish version of the script."
