  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is hard to follow because it contains many out‑of‑place markers such as “Traducción al español:”, unfinished sentences, and English fragments (e.g., “Such is the reality of ICL”). The opening line “Camille: where” makes no sense, and several turns of dialogue are reduced to placeholder notes like “Camille: Spanish translation result: ‘De acuerdo.’”. These interruptions break the flow and make comprehension difficult for a reader.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Even when the meaning is clear, the wording often sounds unnatural. Phrases like “Y yo soy Luc.”, “Camille: where”, and “Luc: it is” are awkward. The insertion of meta‑text (e.g., “Traducción al español:”) is not something a native speaker would produce in a podcast script. Verb tenses and article usage are sometimes incorrect, leading to a stilted style.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms (preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje/grounding) are mostly rendered correctly and consistently. However, occasional English words remain (e.g., “prompt”, “ICL”) and some terms are explained in a clumsy way, reducing the overall precision.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to fully adapt the original conversational tone. The presence of literal tags and English fragments betrays a lack of cultural adaptation. The script sounds more like a rough draft than a polished Spanish podcast, so the intended impact is weakened.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Important content from the French original is omitted or replaced by placeholder notes. For example, the explanation of “affinage” as a specialization, the analogy about consulting, and the concluding thank‑you are all present, but many lines are missing or garbled. Consequently, the Spanish version does not convey the full information.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of low quality. While the core technical vocabulary is largely preserved, the text is riddled with untranslated fragments, meta‑annotations, and placeholders that disrupt readability and fluency. Significant portions of the original dialogue are either missing or incompletely rendered, making the Spanish version unsuitable for a podcast audience without extensive editing and cleanup.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 7/20."
