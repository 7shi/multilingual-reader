  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and follows a logical flow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are easy to follow for the target audience. Minor issues with occasional long sentences do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places and uses appropriate vocabulary. A few expressions are slightly awkward (e.g., \"tiene como objetivo crear una competencia permanente\" could be \"una habilidad permanente\", and the comma after \"aprendizaje en contexto\"), but overall it reads smoothly to a native speaker.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally well handled: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, memoria a corto plazo, etc. The only notable lapse is the retention of the English word \"grounding\" instead of translating it to \"anclaje\" or a Spanish equivalent, which creates slight inconsistency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are appropriately adapted (e.g., \"consultor brillante\") and the examples remain relevant for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve resonance, but overall the adaptation is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as the source. Redundancies are minimal, and the translation stays concise while keeping the nuance of the original.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and remains accessible to the target audience. Minor issues—mainly a few unnatural phrasing choices and the untranslated term \"grounding\"—prevent a perfect score, but they do not detract significantly from comprehension or effectiveness.\n\n**Overall score (average)**: 17.6 ≈ 18/20."
