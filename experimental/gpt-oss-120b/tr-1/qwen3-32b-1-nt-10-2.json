  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but there are several distracting errors: duplicated speaker tags (\"Luc: Luc:\"), an orphan \"Camille: we\", an incomplete line (\"Luc: - de l'ICL\"), and agreement mistakes such as \"las conocimientos\". These break the flow and force the reader to pause, reducing overall comprehensibility.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains awkward phrasing and literal renderings that sound unnatural to native speakers (e.g., \"Imaginen que se envía a una IA…\", \"Es una analogía perfecta!\", and the literal inclusion of quotes around \"olvidado\"). The presence of copy‑and‑paste artefacts further harms smoothness.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". The consistency is good and the terms are appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and explains the concepts for a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, missing fragments and the occasional literal translation (e.g., \"consultor brillante\" instead of a more idiomatic \"consultor destacado\") limit the adaptation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original information is present, but the truncated line about ICL and the stray \"Camille: we\" cause minor loss of content. No major ideas are omitted, but the gaps reduce completeness.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core ideas of the podcast and uses appropriate technical vocabulary, but it is marred by several typographical and structural errors that affect readability, fluency, and completeness. A careful proofreading and correction of the missing/duplicated lines would raise the quality substantially.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 13/20."
