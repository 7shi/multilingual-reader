  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and the ideas are conveyed in a logical order. Sentences are a bit long but remain understandable. Minor punctuation issues do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text mostly sounds natural, but there are several non‑idiomatic choices (e.g., *el afinamiento* instead of the more common *ajuste fino*, mixed use of *aprendizaje en contexto* vs *aprendizaje contextual*, occasional stiff phrasing). These hiccups prevent a fully native‑like flow.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered (preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje). However, some translations are sub‑optimal or inconsistent – *afinamiento* for *fine‑tuning* and occasional switches between *aprendizaje en contexto* and *aprendizaje contextual* could confuse readers familiar with the standard jargon.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the podcast’s conversational tone and adapted cultural references appropriately. The examples and analogies (consultant vs expert, cramming for an exam) work well for a Spanish‑speaking audience. No cultural mis‑steps were detected.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present. No important detail was omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The core concepts are fully retained.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original content accurately and is easy to follow, but it suffers from a few non‑idiomatic expressions and inconsistent terminology that slightly reduce its naturalness. Improving the choice of technical vocabulary (e.g., using *ajuste fino* for fine‑tuning) and keeping terminology consistent would raise the fluency and terminology scores. The adaptation to the target audience is solid, and the information is complete.\n\n**Final rating:** 17/20 (average of the five criteria)."
