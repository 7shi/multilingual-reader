  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto) are well‑structured. Minor punctuation omissions (missing opening ¿) and a couple of small typographical errors do not significantly impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are several awkward or incorrect lexical choices: “cramer” instead of “aprender de memoria”, the Anglicism “cramming”, the less‑common use of “afinamiento” for “fine‑tuning”, and occasional missing accent marks. These issues make the text feel slightly stilted for a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely handled correctly. Key terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\" (although rendered as \"afinamiento\"), \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are appropriate. The word \"prompt\" is left untranslated, which is acceptable in a tech‑savvy context. Overall consistency is good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal podcast tone, using appropriate interjections (¡Exactamente!, ¡Hola!) and adapting cultural references for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The intent and purpose of the original dialogue are conveyed effectively, with only minor stylistic slips.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the flow of the conversation remains intact. The only drawback is the typo \"cramer\", which could cause momentary confusion but does not remove any substantive content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the original podcast discussion accurately. It is readable and technically sound, though a few lexical inaccuracies and punctuation errors prevent it from being fully natural. Minor revisions—correcting \"cramer\" to a proper Spanish expression, polishing the use of \"afinamiento\" to \"ajuste fino\", and fixing punctuation—would raise the fluency to a near‑native level.\n\n**Final score (average)**: 17.2 / 20"
