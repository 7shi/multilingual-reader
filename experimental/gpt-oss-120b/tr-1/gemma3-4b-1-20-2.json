  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original dialogue structure, but there are several hiccups that hurt smooth reading: duplicated speaker tags (e.g., “Camille: Camille:”), an incomplete sentence “Luc: enviar una nueva IA a la escuela”, and occasional missing articles or commas. These issues force the reader to pause and infer meaning, lowering the score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many natural‑sounding passages, yet several expressions feel awkward or literal (“La IA no ha ‘olvidado’ al sentido humano del término”, “se ha vaciado” instead of “se ha vaciado el espacio”). French terms like “ancrage” are left untranslated, and the verb tense in “Luc: enviar una nueva IA a la escuela” is incorrect. Overall it reads okay but not as fluid as a native‑written script.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary (pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL) is correctly rendered and consistent. The main drawback is the retention of the French word “ancrage” instead of a Spanish equivalent (anclaje/encuadre), which could confuse readers unfamiliar with the term. Otherwise terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast tone and the educational intent, adapting greetings (“Buenos días”) and maintaining the dialogue flow. Minor cultural mismatches appear when French terms are left in, and duplicated speaker labels break immersion. Still, the core message is conveyed suitably for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the “memory” feature. No significant content is omitted, and the examples remain intact. Minor typographical redundancies do not affect completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job transmitting the technical content and the conversational style of the podcast, but it suffers from several editorial oversights (duplicate speaker tags, incomplete sentences, and a few untranslated French terms) that reduce readability and naturalness. Technical terminology is largely well‑handled, and the information is complete, making the text useful, though it would benefit from a thorough proofread and slight localization of a few terms to reach native‑speaker fluency.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
