    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is fragmented and interspersed with English and French fragments, meta‑labels (e.g., “**Traducción al español:**”), and placeholder sentences such as “Camille: where”. This makes it difficult for a Spanish‑speaking reader to follow the dialogue smoothly. Sentence order is sometimes logical, but the interruptions break the flow.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many expressions sound unnatural (“It is therefore a trick?”, “memory”, “Such is the reality of ICL”). The mix of languages, abrupt switches, and literal translations of French idioms reduce naturalness. Vocabulary is generally adequate for technical content, but overall the text does not read like native Spanish.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje) are correctly rendered. However, some terms remain in English (e.g., “prompt”, “ICL”) and there are inconsistent annotations (e.g., “**Traducción al español:**”). The handling is acceptable but not consistent.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to keep the podcast tone, but cultural adaptation is weak. The inclusion of English tags, French fragments, and literal translations of jokes (“memoria de uso único”) hinder the intended conversational style for a Spanish audience. Some parts are over‑explained with meta‑comments that would not appear in a natural script.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The bulk of the original information is present: the concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and memory tricks are all mentioned. Nevertheless, several lines are garbled or omitted (e.g., “Camille: where”, incomplete sentences, placeholders like “it is”). The meaning is largely retained but with noticeable gaps.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core technical ideas but suffers from severe consistency and readability problems. Mixed language fragments, meta‑annotations, and unfinished sentences make the text feel more like a draft with editorial notes than a polished Spanish podcast script. While technical terminology is mostly accurate, the overall flow, naturalness, and cultural adaptation need substantial improvement to be suitable for a native‑speaking audience.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 7/20."
