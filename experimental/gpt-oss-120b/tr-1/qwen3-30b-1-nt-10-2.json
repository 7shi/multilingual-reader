  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is clear and easy to follow. The dialogue format is preserved, sentences are well‑structured, and the explanations of complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are presented in a comprehensible way. Minor issues such as the mixture of “partís” and “abres” do not hinder understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and the style matches a podcast script. A few spots feel slightly odd – e.g., keeping English terms like *fine‑tuning* unchanged, and the phrase “es del bachotaje” – but these do not break the flow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly. Core concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding → anclaje) are rendered consistently. Retaining English terms such as *fine‑tuning* is acceptable in a technical context, though a Spanish equivalent could improve uniformity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the original intent, tone, and purpose. Cultural references are unchanged, which is appropriate. The adaptation to Spanish‑speaking audiences is smooth, with idiomatic expressions like “consultor brillante” that fit the context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the logical progression of ideas is preserved. The only minor deviation is a slightly awkward verb choice (“afinada”) that still conveys the original meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It faithfully conveys the technical discussion while remaining accessible to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Readability and completeness are excellent; fluency and terminology are very good, with only minor stylistic quirks. The translation would serve well in a podcast setting without requiring major revisions.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
