  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas, and complex concepts are explained with appropriate examples. Minor issues such as an extra parenthesis after “preentrenamiento” and a few long sentences slightly affect flow, but overall a reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are occasional awkward phrasings (e.g., “Más bien vea:” instead of “Más bien, vea”, the typo “Luco” instead of “Luc”, and redundant expressions like “Aprendizaje en Contexto” repeated). Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, yet the few hiccups prevent it from being completely fluid.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding (anclaje) are correctly rendered and used consistently. The translator kept the meaning of each term and provided Spanish equivalents where needed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural references are adapted (e.g., “consultor brillante”), and the title is appropriately localized to “Tecnología Relámpago”. Minor phrasing issues do not change the message, so the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the explanations remain intact. The only loss is a tiny typographic error, which does not affect content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, keeps the conversational tone, and is largely readable and natural. Small punctuation errors, a typo, and occasional awkward phrasing keep it from being perfect, but these do not impede comprehension. The translator demonstrated solid command of both languages and the subject matter.\n\nScore: 87/100 (average of the five criteria)."
