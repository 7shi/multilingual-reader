  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but several passages hinder smooth reading. There are untranslated English fragments (e.g., “Thus, after pre‑training…”), a raw JSON snippet that appears in the middle of a sentence, and some clunky phrasing such as “simplemente le proporcionaron un truco”. These issues break the flow and force the reader to pause, lowering overall readability.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation feels overly literal in many places. Phrases like “el afinado” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”, and constructions such as “da la impresión de que la IA recuerda… simplemente le proporcionaron un truco” sound unnatural to native speakers. The presence of the JSON object and occasional English words further disrupt naturalness.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely correctly rendered: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “grounding” → “anclaje”. Some terms could be refined (e.g., “afinado” → “ajuste fino”), and consistency could be improved, but overall the terminology is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original podcast’s style and cultural references, which is good. However, the literal translation of several sentences and the insertion of a JSON snippet ignore Spanish‑speaking audience expectations. A few idiomatic adjustments would make the text feel more natural in the target culture.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All main ideas from the French original are present; no major concepts are omitted. Minor losses occur with the untranslated English clause and the noisy JSON insertion, but the factual content remains intact.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning accurately, but it suffers from literalness, occasional untranslated fragments, and a stray JSON object that disrupts both readability and fluency. Terminology is mostly solid, though some word choices could be more idiomatic. With careful editing to remove artifacts and smooth out phrasing, the translation would reach a higher quality level.\n\n**Overall score:** 72/100"
