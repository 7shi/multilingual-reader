    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and conveys the main ideas, but several sentences are awkward or contain errors that hinder smooth reading. Examples include the truncated line \"Voy\" (should be \"Veo\"), the mixed English word \"Simply\" and the phrase \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es aprovechamiento\" which is unclear. These issues lower the overall readability for a native audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While many sentences flow naturally, there are noticeable non‑native constructions and literal translations. Phrases such as \"Usted ha entendido todo\" and the abrupt \"Simply utiliza\" break the natural rhythm. The incomplete sentence and occasional misuse of vocabulary (e.g., \"aprovechamiento\" for \"bachotage\") further reduce fluency.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (Aprendizaje en contexto)\" and \"anclaje\" are appropriate. The translation keeps some English terms like \"prompt\" unchanged, which is acceptable in a technical context. The main shortfall is the mistranslation of \"bachotage\" as \"aprovechamiento\" instead of a more accurate \"bachotaje\" or \"estudio intensivo\".",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent of the podcast is preserved and the formal register matches the French \"vous\". However, several awkward phrasings and the presence of English fragments make the adaptation feel less polished for Spanish‑speaking listeners. The missing part of Camille's line also reflects a minor lapse in adapting the discourse.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original dialogue are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of \"memory\" features. The only notable omission is the incomplete translation of Camille’s \"Je vois\" (rendered as a solitary \"Voy\"), which does not affect the technical content significantly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully conveys the technical content and overall structure of the original French podcast, and most specialized terminology is correctly rendered. Nevertheless, the text suffers from several linguistic inaccuracies, untranslated English words, and a truncated sentence that affect readability and naturalness. With editorial polishing to fix these issues, the translation could reach a much higher quality level."
