  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and the flow of ideas mirrors the original. However, a stray English meta‑comment (\"In this structure…\") appears in the middle of the dialogue, breaking the narrative. Some sentences are a bit wordy or use uncommon phrasing (e.g., \"el afinado\"), which can slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural, but there are several awkward spots: inconsistent use of \"tus\" vs. \"vuestras\", the literal translation \"el afinado\" instead of the more idiomatic \"ajuste fino\", and the intrusive English note. These issues make the text feel less polished for a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\" and \"grounding\" are retained or explained. The only weakness is the inconsistent rendering of \"fine‑tuning\" as both \"afinado\" and \"afinamiento\". Overall, terminology is appropriate and consistent enough.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and analogies, adapting them well for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral and the explanations remain clear. The out‑of‑place English annotation detracts slightly from adaptation, but the rest of the content is suitably localized.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All substantive information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the technical details are retained. The only extra material is the English meta‑comment, which adds noise but does not remove any original content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and keeps the technical explanations clear. It suffers from a few consistency issues (pronouns, fine‑tuning terminology) and an accidental insertion of English explanatory text, which affect readability and fluency. Apart from these flaws, the terminology and contextual adaptation are strong, and the content is complete.\n\nOverall score (sum of the five criteria): 82/100."
