  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but several sentences are truncated or lack necessary connectors, making the flow choppy. For example, “Camille: pre-entraînement” is left untranslated and the sentence “Luc: enviar una nueva IA a la escuela” misses the introductory clause, forcing the reader to infer the missing context. Repetitions such as “Luc: Luc:” also disrupt comprehension. Overall, a native Spanish reader can follow the main ideas, but the occasional gaps reduce ease of reading.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains numerous awkward constructions and typographical errors. Phrases like “Mire, por ejemplo” should be “Mira, por ejemplo”, and duplicated speaker tags (“Luc: Luc:”) break the natural rhythm. Some French words remain (e.g., “pre‑entraînement”, “ancrage”) and the use of English “grounding” is not fully adapted. While the vocabulary is mostly appropriate, the overall smoothness expected from a native speaker is lacking.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely preserved and correctly rendered: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL”. However, a few terms are left in French (“ancrage”) or not explained (“grounding”). Consistency is good for most terms, but the few oversights prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and the podcast‑style dialogue, but cultural and linguistic adaptation is imperfect. The untranslated French snippets and the literal rendering of some expressions make the text feel partially foreign to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Nevertheless, the core message about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning is retained.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major concepts from the French script are present, but certain details are lost or abbreviated. The introductory example about sending an AI to school is cut, and the duplicate speaker tags create minor confusion. No major factual information is omitted, yet the missing connective phrasing reduces completeness.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the overall structure and most of the technical content of the original French podcast, but it suffers from several linguistic oversights: untranslated French terms, truncated sentences, duplicated speaker labels, and occasional awkward phrasing. These issues affect readability, fluency, and cultural adaptation, though the technical terminology is mostly well‑handled. A careful edit to remove French remnants, correct duplication, and smooth out sentence constructions would raise the quality substantially.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 13/20."
