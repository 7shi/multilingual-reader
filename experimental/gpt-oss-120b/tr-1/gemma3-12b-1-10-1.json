  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is fragmented and contains many unfinished sentences, English fragments, and editorial notes (e.g., “; verb phrase:”, “* **issues du pré‑entraînement:**”). These interruptions make it difficult for a reader to follow the conversation. The logical flow of the dialogue is broken, and several lines are incomprehensible without reference to the original French.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mixes Spanish, French, and English, uses literal constructions (“la IA no tiene « olvidado » en el sentido humano del término”), and leaves placeholder text. Vocabulary choices are often inappropriate or awkward (e.g., “trabajo de última hora” for “last‑minute work”). The overall style does not sound natural to a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are present, which is good. However, they are inconsistently rendered, sometimes left in French or English, and no explanations are provided for a non‑expert audience. The term \"ICL\" is introduced without clarification, and the translation of \"grounding\" is missing.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains meta‑comments about the translation process, which are irrelevant to the podcast script and distract the reader. Cultural adaptation is minimal; the conversational tone of the original is lost, and the Spanish version includes unnatural interrogative tags and filler text that do not match the target audience’s expectations.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several portions of the original dialogue are omitted or severely truncated (e.g., Luc’s final explanation about the \"Memoria\" feature is missing). Editorial placeholders replace actual content, resulting in loss of important information and breaking the continuity of the episode.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is far from publishable. It mixes languages, contains numerous editorial notes, and lacks a coherent, fluent narrative. While some technical terminology is correctly identified, the overall execution fails to convey the original podcast’s content in a clear, natural, and complete manner. A thorough rewrite, removing all meta‑comments and ensuring consistent Spanish phrasing, is required.\n\nOverall score: 4/20"
