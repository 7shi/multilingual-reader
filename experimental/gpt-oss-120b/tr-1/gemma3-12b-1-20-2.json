  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is riddled with incomplete sentences, placeholders (e.g., \"totally new/o\", \"\"), English fragments, and meta‑comments about translation choices. This makes it very hard for a Spanish‑speaking reader to follow the dialogue. The logical flow of the podcast script is broken in many places, so comprehension is severely impaired.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Even when a Spanish sentence is present, the phrasing is often literal, awkward, or unidiomatic (e.g., \"estudiar a última hora\", \"aprendizaje a corto plazo\" used out of context). The mixture of English, French, and explanatory notes further disrupts naturalness. The text does not read as a smooth, native‑speaker podcast script.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are correctly rendered, but many other terms are missing, mistranslated, or left in the original language. The inconsistent handling of terminology reduces clarity for the target audience.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to adapt cultural references or podcast‑style language to Spanish. It includes meta‑commentary that would never appear in a spoken episode, and some explanations are truncated or omitted, weakening the intended persuasive and educational tone.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are omitted or replaced by editorial notes (e.g., \"( ) to emphasize...\", \"**2. Contextual Interpretation:**\"). Important arguments about fine‑tuning vs. in‑context learning, the analogy of a consultant, and the concluding rhetorical question are either missing or incompletely rendered.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is far from usable. It contains numerous gaps, untranslated fragments, and editorial interjections that disrupt readability and fluency. While some core technical vocabulary is correctly translated, the bulk of the content is either lost or presented in a confusing hybrid of languages and notes. A thorough rewrite is needed to produce a coherent, natural‑sounding Spanish podcast script that faithfully conveys the original French content.\n\nScore summary: readability 4/20, fluency 3/20, terminology 5/20, contextual adaptation 4/20, information completeness 5/20. The total reflects a very low-quality translation that requires extensive revision."
