  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is a patchwork of incomplete sentences, stray English notes and placeholders (e.g., “exponer,” “Luc: …”, “window of discussion”). Many turns of dialogue are truncated or missing, making it hard for a reader to follow the flow of the conversation. The logical progression of ideas is broken, so comprehension requires a lot of guesswork.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains numerous unnatural constructions (\"brindarle una base de conocimientos\", \"no necesita volver a aprender lo esencial\", \"good observation\" left in English) and abrupt switches between Spanish, English and French. Vocabulary choices are sometimes appropriate but the overall sentence rhythm is disjointed, giving the impression of a literal draft rather than a polished translation.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)” are mostly rendered, but inconsistently (e.g., “window of discussion” is left untranslated, “oublie” appears in French). Some key concepts are omitted or replaced by meta‑comments, which reduces terminological coherence.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original French podcast aims to explain AI learning stages to a general audience. The Spanish translation fails to preserve this explanatory tone because large portions are missing and meta‑instructions are kept in the output. Cultural or audience‑appropriate adjustments are absent; instead the reader is left with a fragmented script.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A substantial amount of content from the source is omitted or replaced by editorial notes (e.g., “Luc: …”, “The entire phrase means translation to French”). Important explanations about pre‑training, fine‑tuning vs. in‑context learning, and memory features are either incomplete or absent, resulting in loss of key information.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is far from usable. It reads like a draft interleaved with translator notes rather than a finished Spanish version of the podcast. Many sentences are cut off, technical terms are handled inconsistently, and crucial explanatory content is missing. A complete, clean rewrite is required to make the text understandable and faithful to the original French dialogue.\n\nOverall quality is very low; the translation would need a thorough revision from scratch to be acceptable for native Spanish listeners.\n\nScore: 4/20"
