  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the structure of the original dialogue. Most sentences convey the intended meaning, but several phrasing choices are awkward (e.g., \"¡Hola y bienvenido en…\", \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es aprendizaje en última hora\"). Minor punctuation and accent errors (\"¿Porque\" instead of \"¿Por qué\") slightly hinder smooth reading. Overall a native reader can follow the content, but would need to reread a few passages.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are multiple non‑native constructions: preposition misuse (\"bienvenido en\"), literal translations that sound stiff (\"Más bien, vea:\"), agreement errors (\"La conocimientos\"), and occasional missing accents. Vocabulary is appropriate, but the flow is disrupted by these errors, making the text feel translated rather than originally written in Spanish.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"grounding\" (anclaje). The choice of \"afinamiento\" for \"fine‑tuning\" is acceptable, though \"ajuste fino\" is more common. Consistency is good and the reader can grasp the concepts.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the original intent and the podcast‑style conversational tone. Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is required. However, some literal renderings (e.g., \"aprendizaje en última hora\") lose the idiomatic nuance of \"cramming\" and sound odd in Spanish. The overall message is preserved but could be smoother.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of \"memory\" features. No substantive information is omitted, only minor typographic errors.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full technical content and retains the dialogue format, but it suffers from several fluency and readability issues typical of a literal translation. Terminology is handled well, and no information is lost, yet the text would benefit from a native‑speaker edit to smooth awkward phrasing, fix grammatical errors, and choose more idiomatic expressions for concepts like \"cramming\". With these refinements the translation would reach a much higher quality level.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 76"
