    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original script. Most sentences are easy to understand, and technical concepts are explained in plain language. Minor issues affect readability: the English interjection \"I see.\" is left untranslated, and a few punctuation choices feel abrupt. Overall, a reader would grasp the discussion without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, using idiomatic Spanish and appropriate register for a podcast. However, there are occasional awkward phrasings (e.g., \"una memoria de uso único\" instead of \"una memoria de un solo uso\"), the retained English term \"prompt\" without any contextual cue, and the untranslated \"I see.\" These hiccups prevent a perfect native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is well‑handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinado\" (fine‑tuning), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"grounding\", etc. English acronyms are kept with their Spanish expansions, which is appropriate for the target audience. Consistency is maintained throughout the translation.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish and respects cultural expectations. The introductory greeting and the closing remark are suitably localized. Nonetheless, the final line offers three alternative Spanish titles for the podcast, which introduces unnecessary ambiguity. The leftover English phrase \"I see.\" also shows a missed adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the substantive information from the original script is retained. No major ideas are omitted, and the technical explanations remain intact. The only loss is the untranslated \"I see.\" and the added optional podcast names, which are extra rather than missing content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is strong and conveys the original message accurately. It excels in terminology and maintains the educational tone of the podcast. Minor fluency issues, a few untranslated English fragments, and the inclusion of multiple optional podcast titles prevent it from being flawless. With a few polishing passes these could be resolved, bringing the translation to a near‑native level.\n\nFinal score (out of 100): 84/100."
