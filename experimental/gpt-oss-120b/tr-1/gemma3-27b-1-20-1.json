  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and follows a logical flow. Sentences are slightly long but understandable, and the main ideas are explained in simple terms. Minor issues like the hyphenated “pre‑entrenamiento” do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation reads naturally, but there are a few awkward or inaccurate expressions (e.g., “memorizando de carril”, “vinculación” for grounding, and occasional literal French‑style constructions). These moments break the smoothness for a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL”. The choice of “vinculación” for grounding is acceptable, though “anclaje” might be more common. Consistency is good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish well (“Hola y bienvenidos”, “te escuchamos”). Cultural references are preserved and the informal conversational style feels appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present. No significant ideas are omitted, and the explanation of memory‑like features is intact. Only minor wording quirks affect precision, not content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency suffers from a few unnatural phrases. The adaptation respects the podcast’s informal style and retains the full informational load. With minor polishing of awkward expressions, it would be near‑perfect for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\nScore breakdown: Readability 17/20, Fluency 15/20, Terminology 18/20, Contextual Adaptation 18/20, Information Completeness 19/20. The average yields an overall rating of 17/20."
