    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are clear. A few long sentences and minor punctuation quirks (extra spaces before guillemets, missing commas) slightly hinder flow, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most parts, but there are several spots that feel slightly off for a native speaker: “Miren:” is a bit informal for a podcast script, “el afinado” is less common than “ajuste fino”, and “una forma astuta de aprendizaje automático en contexto” mixes terminology oddly. The use of “chuleta” is colloquial and region‑specific, which may feel out of place for a broader audience. Overall, the language is smooth but not completely idiomatic.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, and the acronym ICL are correctly rendered. The choice of “anclaje” for “grounding” is acceptable, though some translators might prefer “referenciación”. Consistency is maintained throughout the text.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal, conversational tone of a podcast and adapts greetings (“Hola y bienvenidos”) appropriately. Cultural references are neutral, and the occasional colloquialism (e.g., “chuleta”) adds a local flavor without breaking the overall intent. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve alignment with a wider Spanish‑speaking audience, but the core message and purpose are fully conveyed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and analogies from the original French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is lost or altered, and the logical progression of the discussion is intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and faithfully transmits the original content. It excels in completeness and technical accuracy, while readability is good. Fluency and a few stylistic choices prevent it from reaching a perfect score, but overall it would be easily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners of a tech podcast. Minor adjustments—especially smoothing informal interjections and opting for more standard technical phrasing—would raise the naturalness to native‑level quality."
