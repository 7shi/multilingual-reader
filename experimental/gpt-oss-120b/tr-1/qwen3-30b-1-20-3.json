  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the sentences are easy to follow. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained clearly and with appropriate examples. A few sentences are slightly long (e.g., the one about the temporary memory), but overall the reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker in most places. Vocabulary such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are appropriate. Minor awkwardness appears in phrases like \"La IA no está constantemente afinada por sus conversaciones\" (a more idiomatic phrasing would be \"La IA no se está afinando continuamente con sus conversaciones\") and \"el afinamiento\" (many would prefer \"ajuste fino\"). These do not break comprehension but slightly reduce fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\" → \"afinamiento\", \"transfer learning\" → \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"in‑context learning\" → \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\". The translations keep the original meaning and are suitable for a non‑specialist audience. Only the term \"afinamiento\" is a bit unconventional, but it is still understandable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and tone of a podcast conversation. Cultural references are neutral, and the Spanish version uses expressions familiar to the target audience (e.g., \"una IA totalmente nueva\" instead of a literal \"una IA nueva de la nada\"). The adaptation keeps the informal, explanatory style appropriate for a tech‑focused podcast.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No major information is omitted, and no unnecessary repetitions are added. The translation also preserves the structure of the dialogue, ensuring that the flow of ideas matches the original.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation from French to Spanish is of high quality. It faithfully conveys the technical content and the conversational tone of the podcast, with clear explanations and consistent terminology. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve naturalness, but they do not affect the overall comprehension. The work demonstrates a strong command of both languages and the subject matter.\n\nScore Summary:\n- Readability: 18/20\n- Fluency: 17/20\n- Terminology: 18/20\n- Contextual Adaptation: 18/20\n- Information Completeness: 19/20\nOverall, the translation deserves a solid 90/100 rating."
