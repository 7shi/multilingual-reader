  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand. The main ideas and technical explanations are clear, and sentence structures are mostly logical. Minor issues such as duplicated speaker labels (e.g., “Camille: Camille:” and “Luc: Luc:”) and occasional punctuation glitches slightly disrupt the flow, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, using appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic expressions (“consultor brillante”, “chuleta”). However, there are a few awkward moments (repeated speaker tags, the phrase “Imagina que enviamos una IA recién creada a la escuela para darle una cultura general” feels a bit clunky, and occasional literal translations like “ventana de contexto” without additional contextualization). Overall the language sounds native but not perfectly polished.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “anclaje” are all correctly rendered. The only slight drawback is the lack of a brief parenthetical clarification for “grounding”, which could be unfamiliar to some readers. Consistency across the script is maintained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience (e.g., using “chuleta” as a colloquial “cheat‑sheet” is understandable). Small issues such as occasional overly literal phrasing do not significantly affect the message. Overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No concepts are omitted, and the explanations remain intact. The only minor flaw is the duplicated speaker tags, which are redundant but do not result in loss of content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. It is largely readable and natural, with good handling of terminology and faithful preservation of the original’s educational tone. Minor typographical repetitions and a few slightly stiff sentences prevent a perfect score, but the overall quality is high and suitable for a podcast audience.\nOverall score (out of 100): 85/100."
