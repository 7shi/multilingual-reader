  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas with logical structure. Minor punctuation issues (e.g., an extra parenthesis) do not hinder comprehension, but a few small wording choices could be smoother.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native speaker overall. There are occasional awkward constructions (e.g., “el aprendizaje en contexto, es memorización.”) and a slight over‑use of commas, but the flow is generally smooth and the conversational podcast tone is well preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL”, etc. The choice of “anclaje” for “grounding” is acceptable, and the word “prompt” is kept, which is common in the field. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original’s informal, podcast style to Spanish, using appropriate greetings and exclamation marks. Cultural references are kept neutral, and the title is adapted to “Tech Relámpago”. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve the fit, but the intent and tone are well conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary content. The only issues are typographical rather than informational.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate, fluent, and retains the educational yet conversational tone of the original podcast. Minor punctuation errors and a few slightly stiff phrasings keep it from being perfect, but overall it delivers the full technical content clearly and naturally to a Spanish‑speaking audience.\nOverall rating (average of criteria): 18/20.\n\nScore out of 20 points: 18"
