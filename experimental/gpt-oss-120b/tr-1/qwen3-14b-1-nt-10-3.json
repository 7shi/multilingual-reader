  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the original flow, but there are noticeable hiccups that disrupt smooth reading. The most serious is the mistranslation “crammar” (instead of a phrase meaning “studying for an exam”), which can confuse readers. Minor punctuation issues and occasional overly literal constructions also affect clarity.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places; vocabulary and sentence structures are appropriate for a podcast script. Nevertheless, a few awkward phrases (e.g., “por lo tanto, transfiere sus inmensos conocimientos…”, “es una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”) and the typo mentioned above make it sound slightly stilted.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: preentrenamiento, afinado/fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, etc. The translator kept English loanwords like “prompt” when appropriate and provided Spanish equivalents consistently.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The tone of a conversational podcast is preserved, and cultural references are suitable for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The only drawback is the erroneous “crammar” which betrays a lack of careful adaptation for that specific idiom.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the ideas from the French original are present; no major sections are omitted. The translation faithfully conveys the distinctions between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning, as well as the discussion about “memory” features.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. Readability and fluency are slightly marred by a few mistranslations and awkward phrasings, the most glaring being the non‑existent verb “crammar”. Terminology and completeness are strong points. With a quick proofread to fix the typo and smooth out a couple of sentences, the text would be near‑native quality.\n\nFinal averaged score (rounded): 16/20.\n\nScore: 16"
