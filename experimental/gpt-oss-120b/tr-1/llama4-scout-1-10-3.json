  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is hard to follow. Several sentences are left in French or English, placeholders such as “Spanish translation result” appear, and some lines are abruptly cut. The reader must constantly switch languages to understand the dialogue, which severely impairs comprehension.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Even the Spanish portions that exist are often literal translations that sound unnatural (“el ajuste fino”, “ventana de contexto”). There are grammatical mismatches (e.g., gender agreement, missing accents) and awkward phrasing that a native speaker would not use.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL) are rendered correctly, but many remain in French (“affinage”) or English, and some are inconsistently translated. The handling is therefore only partially appropriate.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to adapt culturally or stylistically. It retains French idioms, mixes languages, and does not adjust examples for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The original intent is partially lost.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Important content is omitted or replaced by placeholder text. Several explanatory sentences are missing, and the dialogue is fragmented, resulting in loss of information compared to the original script.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is far from acceptable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. It contains numerous untranslated fragments, placeholders, and abrupt interruptions, making it difficult to read and understand. While some technical vocabulary is correctly translated, the overall coherence, fluency, and completeness are severely compromised. A thorough rewrite is needed, ensuring that every line is fully rendered into natural Spanish and that no content is omitted or left in the source language.\n\nGiven the scores on the five criteria, the average performance is very low, reflecting a translation that would require major revision before publication.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 5/20.\n\nRecommendations: rewrite the whole script in Spanish, keep consistent terminology, eliminate mixed‑language fragments, and verify that all original information is preserved.\n\n---\n**Scoring summary**: Readability 5, Fluency 4, Terminology 6, Contextual Adaptation 5, Information Completeness 4. The final aggregated score is 5 out of 20."
