  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas are easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured, and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are understandable. Minor clunkiness (e.g., \"¿Esto es decir?\") does not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the translation is comprehensible, several expressions sound unnatural to a native speaker: \"¿Esto es decir?\", \"maestrar\" instead of \"dominar\", \"competencia permanente\" instead of \"habilidad permanente\", and occasional awkward word order. These issues lower the overall fluidity.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly and consistently. Key terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"anclaje\" (grounding) are preserved and appropriately rendered.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts the discourse to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogy of a consultant is kept. Some literal renderings (e.g., \"consultor temporal\") feel a bit stiff, but the overall message is conveyed effectively.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No relevant details are omitted, and the flow of the conversation remains intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content of the podcast. Terminology is accurate and the full meaning is retained. Readability is good, but fluency suffers from a handful of unnatural phrasing choices that a native editor would smooth out. Overall, it is a competent translation that could be polished further for native‑speaker naturalness.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
