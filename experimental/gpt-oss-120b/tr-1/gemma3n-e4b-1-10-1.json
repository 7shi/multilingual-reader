    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas are easy to follow. The flow of the conversation is preserved, and complex concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. Minor issues reduce readability: the opening mixes French « Bonjour » with Spanish, the gendered “bienvenido/a” feels clunky, and there is an occasional shift between “tus” and “vuestras”. These do not block comprehension but do create slight hiccups.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but a few phrases are awkward or overly literal. Examples: “¡Bonjour y bienvenido/a a…” mixes languages; “presentárselo una cantidad mucho menor de texto en francés” is a literal construction; the alternation of “tus” and “vuestras” is inconsistent. The use of English technical terms such as “prompt” is acceptable in a tech podcast, but the surrounding Spanish could be smoother. The majority of sentences are fluent and would be understood by native speakers without effort.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms like “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and “grounding” are translated correctly or kept in their standard form. Consistency is maintained throughout the script. The only minor point is the retention of the English word “prompt”, which is common in the field, so it does not detract from the translation.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone (informal, inquisitive) and the podcast’s educational purpose. Cultural adaptation is mostly appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience, though the opening “¡Bonjour” remains French, which slightly reduces the sense of full adaptation. The rest of the dialogue uses idiomatic Spanish and reflects the conversational style of the original.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the technical explanations are retained. Small stylistic inconsistencies (e.g., “tus” vs. “vuestras”) do not affect the conveyed content. Therefore the translation is complete and faithful.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately while maintaining an engaging, podcast‑like tone. Minor linguistic slips—mixing languages in the greeting, occasional pronoun inconsistency, and a few literal phrasings—prevent it from being perfect, but they do not hinder understanding. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking tech audience.\n\n**Total score:** 84 / 100 (average 16.8 per criterion)."
