  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Most sentences convey the original ideas without excessive complexity, and the logical flow of the podcast dialogue is preserved. Minor issues such as leaving “I see.” in English and occasional punctuation quirks slightly affect smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are several awkward choices: \"afinado\" for fine‑tuning (the usual term is \"ajuste fino\"), \"Le hace lectura\" (better as \"Lee\"), the inclusion of multiple translation options for the podcast name at the end, and the mixed English phrase “I see.” These reduce the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly well handled: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, ventana de contexto, grounding, etc. The only notable inconsistency is the use of \"afinado\" instead of the standard \"ajuste fino\". The term *prompt* is left in English, which is acceptable for a technical audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the informal podcast tone well, using appropriate Spanish greetings and exclamations. Cultural adaptation is adequate, though the final line offering three possible Spanish titles creates slight confusion. Overall the intent and purpose of the original are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French source is retained. No major ideas are omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is kept intact. Minor cosmetic issues (e.g., the untranslated \"I see.\") do not affect the conveyed content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. It would benefit from polishing a few lexical choices (e.g., using \"ajuste fino\"), eliminating leftover English fragments, and selecting a single consistent Spanish title for the podcast. With these tweaks, the text would read as a fully natural Spanish podcast script.\n\nFinal average score: 16.8 → 17/20.\n\nScore: 17/20"
