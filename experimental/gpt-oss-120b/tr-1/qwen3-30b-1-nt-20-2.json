  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented clearly. Sentences are well‑structured and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are easy to follow for a general audience. Minor hiccups such as a missing pronoun in “Ella olvida todo” do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, using idiomatic Spanish and appropriate register. A few phrases are slightly literal (“consultor brillante”, “ventana de contexto”) but they remain understandable and do not feel awkward. Vocabulary is contemporary and fits a podcast style.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently handled: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje/grounding, etc. Where necessary, the translator kept the English acronyms (ICL) and provided Spanish equivalents, preserving precision for a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French content to a Spanish‑speaking listener without losing the intent. Cultural references are neutral, which is appropriate. Some sentences retain a very literal tone (“consultor brillante”) that could be slightly more colloquial, but the overall message and tone are preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original script is present. No sections are omitted, and the technical explanations remain intact. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy and keeps the length comparable to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality: it conveys the technical content accurately, reads smoothly for Spanish speakers, and retains the pedagogical tone of the podcast. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve naturalness, but they do not detract from the overall effectiveness.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
