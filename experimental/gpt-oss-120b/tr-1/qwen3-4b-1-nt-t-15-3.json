  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable. The main ideas and technical explanations are clear, and the dialogue flow mirrors the original. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., “bienvenido en” instead of “bienvenido a”, occasional misuse of articles) do not prevent comprehension, but they slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several unnatural constructions: inconsistent use of formal ‘Usted’ vs. informal ‘tú’, wrong gender agreement in “las información”, and awkward phrasing such as “bienvenido en”. These issues make the translation feel less native‑like, though the overall meaning remains intact.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered – preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, fine‑tuning (aunque “ajuste fino” sería más habitual). The terminology is consistent and appropriate for a general‑audience podcast.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor cultural/formality mismatches (mix of ‘tú’ and ‘Usted’) and a few article errors slightly reduce the adaptation quality.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All relevant information from the French script is preserved. No substantive ideas are omitted, and the examples (consultant, mémoire, etc.) are retained. The translation is therefore complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the podcast’s content accurately and keeps the technical discussion intact. However, it suffers from several grammatical and stylistic inaccuracies that affect fluency and readability. Terminology is well handled, and no major information is lost, but a native‑speaker edit would be needed to polish the language, resolve article/genus errors, and maintain a consistent level of formality throughout the dialogue.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
