    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version flows logically and the sentences are generally clear. Complex ideas such as pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje y aprendizaje en contexto are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can follow. A few sentences are long, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, using appropriate colloquial expressions (\"Tiene sentido\", \"Una analogía perfecta\"). There are a couple of slightly awkward phrasings – e.g., \"El propio modelo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus discusiones\" (\"conversaciones\" would be more idiomatic) and the use of \"entre bastidores\" is acceptable but a bit formal for a podcast. Overall, fluency is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, anclaje, memoria. \"Fine‑tuning\" as \"afinamiento\" is acceptable, though some translators prefer \"ajuste fino\"; the choice does not cause confusion. Acronym ICL is kept, which matches common practice. Terminology handling is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the podcast tone—conversational yet informative—and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., \"consultor brillante\" instead of \"consultant\"). Idiomatic French expressions are rendered into natural Spanish equivalents. No cultural mismatch is observed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original script is present. No ideas are omitted, and no extraneous content is added. The structure mirrors the source, preserving the logical progression of concepts.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is very good. It conveys the technical content accurately while remaining accessible to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but the translation succeeds in preserving the original intent, tone, and detail.\n\nStrengths: clear exposition of complex ideas, consistent terminology, faithful content transfer. Areas for improvement: smooth out a few slightly stilted sentences and consider more colloquial alternatives for \"discusión\" vs \"conversación\" in some places.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17.6 ≈ 18/20."
