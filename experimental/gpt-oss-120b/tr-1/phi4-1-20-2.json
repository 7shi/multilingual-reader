  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can understand. There are a few slightly clunky constructions (e.g., \"Imagínate que a una nueva inteligencia artificial la enviamos a la escuela\"), but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but some expressions are literal translations from French that feel odd to native speakers (e.g., \"el afinamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\", \"ventana de contexto\" is acceptable but less idiomatic than \"ventana de contexto ampliada\"). Overall the flow is smooth and the dialogue style is preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". Where a direct Spanish equivalent is uncommon, the original term is kept and clarified, which is appropriate for a tech‑savvy audience. No major terminology errors were found.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original podcast tone and purpose, adapting cultural references (e.g., using \"consultor\" instead of \"consultant\"). The dialogue feels appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking tech audience. Minor opportunities to use more colloquial Spanish were missed, but the overall intent is well conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No significant information was omitted or altered.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and faithful to the source, delivering the technical content clearly while preserving the conversational podcast style. Minor stylistic and lexical choices make it feel slightly less natural than a native‑written script, but these do not impede understanding. The translation would be well received by Spanish‑speaking listeners interested in AI concepts.\n\n**Overall score:** 16/20 (average of the five criteria)."
