  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version presents the dialogue in a clear, logical order. Sentences are generally short and the ideas are easy to follow. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained with adequate examples. A few minor hiccups (e.g., “se le proporciona los documentos” instead of “se le vuelven a proporcionar”) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the text sounds natural, but there are several grammatical slips and slightly awkward phrasing: \n- \"Las nuevas conocimientos\" (gender agreement error). \n- \"entrenamiento previo\" is acceptable but less idiomatic than \"pre‑entrenamiento\". \n- Retaining the English word \"cheat sheet\" feels out of place in a Spanish podcast. \n- Some sentences could be smoother (e.g., \"se le proporciona los documentos una vez más\"). These issues prevent a fully native‑like flow.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly handled correctly: \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"afinamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are appropriate. The translation keeps the original abbreviations, which is standard practice. The only notable error is the gender mismatch in \"las nuevas conocimientos\". Overall the terminology is consistent and appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original intent, tone and pedagogical style of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral, and the examples (consultant, exam cramming) translate well to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor lexical choices (e.g., keeping \"cheat sheet\") could be improved, but they do not distort the message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No relevant segment is omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is maintained. Redundancies are minimal, and the translation stays faithful to the source content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content of the podcast accurately and is largely easy to understand. It succeeds in preserving the educational tone and the step‑by‑step explanation of AI learning methods. The main drawbacks are a few grammatical errors, occasional awkward phrasing, and the retention of an English loanword (\"cheat sheet\"). With a light proofreading pass to fix gender agreement and polish a few sentences, the text would reach a native‑like fluency level.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17.4/20."
