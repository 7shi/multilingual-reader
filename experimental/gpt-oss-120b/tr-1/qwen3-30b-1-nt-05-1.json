  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are easy to follow. Sentences are mostly clear and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are understandable. Minor hiccups such as missing articles (“un modelo experto en inglés, luego presentarle…”) slightly reduce smoothness, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, but a few word choices feel a bit forced. \"El afinamiento\" is not the most idiomatic term for \"fine‑tuning\" (\"ajuste fino\" would be preferred). There are occasional grammatical slips (e.g., \"luego presentarle\" without an article) and redundant phrasing (\"Aprendizaje en Contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\"). These issues keep the text from being fully native‑like.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Core terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" and \"anclaje\" are correctly rendered and used consistently. The only slight weakness is the translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"afinamiento\", which, while understandable, is less common in Spanish technical literature.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are irrelevant, and the language adapts appropriately to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic improvements could be made, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is retained. No substantive content is omitted, and the examples (English‑to‑French transfer, memory feature) are fully reproduced. Redundancies are minimal, and the translation remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency suffers from a few non‑idiomatic expressions and minor grammatical slips. Terminology is mostly accurate, and the content is complete. With a few refinements—especially using more common terms like \"ajuste fino\" and smoothing out article usage—the text would read as a native‑level technical podcast script.\nFinal overall score (average of criteria): 17/20."
