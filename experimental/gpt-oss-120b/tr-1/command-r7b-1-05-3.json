  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original flow, but there are typographical errors (e.g., “Ved” instead of a proper verb), occasional awkward phrasing, and some duplicated sentences that disrupt smooth reading.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but occasional literal renderings and the repeated “Exacto. El aprendizaje por transferencia es la clave…” make the prose feel less fluid. Minor grammar slips (e.g., missing prepositions) also affect naturalness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste (fine‑tuning), aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, y anclaje are correctly rendered and consistently used. The Spanish equivalents are appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and purpose of the original dialogue are preserved, and the cultural context does not require major changes. Minor oddities (e.g., literal translations of some idioms) slightly reduce the adaptation quality.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present; no substantive information is omitted. The only issue is a duplicated paragraph, which adds redundancy but does not remove content.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the technical content accurately and maintains the podcast’s conversational tone. However, typographical errors, duplicated sentences, and occasional unnatural phrasing prevent it from achieving a higher fluency score. A light editorial pass would raise readability and fluency substantially.\n\nScore (out of 100): 80/100."
