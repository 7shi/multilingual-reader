  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to follow. Sentences are mostly short enough for a podcast script and the concepts are explained with clear analogies (e.g., “una analogía perfecta”). A few long sentences and occasional punctuation quirks slightly hamper flow, but the overall comprehension is good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally, but there are several spots that feel awkward to a native speaker: mixed use of “afinado” / “ajuste fino”, the literal inclusion of English acronyms (ICL) without explanation, and occasional literal translations (“una IA completamente nueva” is acceptable but sounds stiff). Overall the language is understandable but not completely idiomatic.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally handled well (preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto). However, consistency suffers: *fine‑tuning* appears as “afinado” and later as “ajuste fino”; “grounding” is rendered as “anclaje”, which is acceptable but not the most common translation. The acronym ICL is left unexplained in Spanish, which could confuse some readers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone of a conversational podcast. Cultural references are appropriate, and the Spanish analogies (e.g., “una analogía perfecta”) fit the target audience. The inserted editorial note about “Sujeto implícito” is unnecessary and slightly breaks the flow, indicating a minor lapse in adaptation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is lost; the only addition is a parenthetical note about the term “afinage”, which does not distort the meaning. The content remains comprehensive and faithful.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical discussion in a podcast‑style format. It is readable and mostly fluent, with accurate terminology, though consistency could be improved. Minor editorial intrusions and occasional stiff phrasing keep it from reaching a higher level of naturalness. Overall, it is a good, functional translation suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners interested in AI concepts, but it would benefit from a final polish for idiomatic flow and term consistency.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 76/100."
