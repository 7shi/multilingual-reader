  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas flow logically. Most sentences are understandable, and complex concepts are explained in a straightforward way. A few constructions (e.g., “levantar el velo”, long chained sentences) are slightly less natural, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward choices: “levantar el velo” is a literal translation that sounds odd in Spanish, “afinamiento” is less common than “ajuste fino”, and the English term “cheat sheet” is left untranslated. Overall, the language is smooth, but these hiccups prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and “ventana de contexto” are correctly rendered. The only minor issue is the use of “afinamiento” instead of the more standard “ajuste fino”, and the retention of the English “cheat sheet”. Consistency and accuracy are otherwise solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone well, adapting the content for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogy of a “consultor brillante” works nicely. Minor literal phrasing (“levantar el velo”) could be smoother, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No relevant detail is omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue faithfully.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, preserving the educational tone and technical depth of the original podcast script. It is clear, largely natural, and technically accurate. Minor lexical choices (e.g., ‘levantar el velo’, ‘afinamiento’, and the untranslated ‘cheat sheet’) keep it from being flawless, but they do not affect the overall understanding. The translation would be very usable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20"
