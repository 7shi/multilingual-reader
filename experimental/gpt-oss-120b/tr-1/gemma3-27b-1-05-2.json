  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the concepts are explained clearly, making the podcast dialogue accessible to a general audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places. A few expressions are slightly awkward or overly colloquial (e.g., “chuleta”, “atiborrarse de estudio”), but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"ICL\" are correctly rendered. The word \"grounding\" is left in English, which is acceptable but breaks consistency; otherwise terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the content to Spanish‑speaking listeners, using suitable equivalents and preserving the original intent. Minor regionalisms (e.g., “chuleta”) could feel out of place for some audiences, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present. No ideas are omitted, and the flow of the dialogue is maintained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is generally high‑quality: it conveys the technical discussion clearly and retains the conversational tone of the podcast. Minor issues are limited to a few colloquial choices and the untranslated term \"grounding\", which slightly affect consistency but do not detract from overall understanding.\n\nStrengths: clear exposition of complex ideas, faithful rendering of technical content, good readability. Areas for improvement: ensure uniform translation of all technical jargon and avoid overly regional slang unless the target audience is specifically defined.\n\nOverall, the work demonstrates solid competence in translating technical material for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
