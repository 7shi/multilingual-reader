  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly understandable, but several sentences are awkward (e.g., “Eso es decir?”, “El aprendizaje en contexto es bachore”, “Así es la persistencia de las cuales, para siempre?”). The missing paragraph about what the model does during pre‑training also forces the reader to fill gaps. Consequently, while the main ideas can be followed, comprehension is hindered in places.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are noticeable fluency problems: English fragments remain (“That’s exactly right…”), literal translations that sound odd, and grammatical slips (missing accents, incorrect verb forms). The style is not smooth enough for a native speaker, making the dialogue feel stilted.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto” and “ICL” are correctly rendered. However, the translation introduces inaccurate jargon (“bachore” for “bachotage”) and occasional inconsistency, which can confuse readers familiar with the field.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely keeps the original intent, but cultural and linguistic adaptation is uneven. Some expressions are literal translations that do not fit Spanish idiom, and the omission of the detailed pre‑training description reduces the conveyed nuance.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A whole explanatory paragraph about the pre‑training process is omitted, and an English sentence is left untranslated. These omissions mean that key information from the original is lost, lowering completeness.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the overall structure of the podcast script but suffers from several serious shortcomings: missing content, untranslated English fragments, awkward phrasing, and a few inaccurate technical renderings. While a reader could grasp the general message, the text would need substantial editing before being suitable for a native‑speaker audience or publication.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 10/20."
