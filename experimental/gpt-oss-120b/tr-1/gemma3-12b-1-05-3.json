  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is riddled with incomplete sentences, stray English fragments, and placeholder notes (e.g., “exponer,” “The entire phrase means translation to French.”). These interruptions break the flow, making it hard for a reader to follow the dialogue. The logical progression of ideas is lost, so comprehension is low.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many expressions are unidiomatic (“exponer,” “fine‑tuning” left in English, “window of discussion,” “olvidé” without context). Word order and verb conjugations are often wrong, and the text jumps between languages. It does not sound natural to a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as «pre‑entrenamiento», «ajuste fino», «aprendizaje por transferencia», and «aprendizaje en contexto» are present, which is good. However, several terms are left untranslated or explained in English, and some concepts are omitted or mis‑explained, leading to inconsistency.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original podcast tone (friendly, explanatory) is largely lost. Cultural references are unchanged, but the translation adds irrelevant meta‑comments and fails to adapt jokes or analogies for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The intent of the original conversation is therefore poorly conveyed.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are missing (e.g., Luc’s longer explanations, the closing remarks). Some sentences are truncated, and the translation includes editorial notes instead of content. Important information about pre‑training, fine‑tuning vs. in‑context learning is incomplete.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is far from usable. It mixes Spanish, French, English, and editorial commentary, resulting in a fragmented and confusing text. While some technical vocabulary is correctly rendered, the overall readability, fluency, and completeness are severely compromised. A thorough re‑translation by a bilingual subject‑matter expert is required to produce a coherent and accurate Spanish version of the podcast script.\n\nScore out of 20 for each criterion is low, reflecting the numerous omissions, unnatural language, and loss of the original’s explanatory tone.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 4.0/20.)\n\nOverall rating: 4/20 (very poor)."
