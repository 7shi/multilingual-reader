  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is riddled with unfinished sentences, abrupt topic switches and leftover editorial notes (e.g., “; verb phrase:”, “* **issues du pré‑entraînement:**”). These disrupt the flow and make it hard for a reader to follow the conversation. Many utterances are fragmented or missing the speaker tag, so the dialogue is confusing.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation frequently sounds like a literal, word‑by‑word conversion rather than natural Spanish. It mixes English fragments, French remnants and meta‑comments, uses awkward constructions (“la potencia amplias” “trabajo de última hora”), and fails to respect Spanish punctuation and idiomatic phrasing.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are present, which is good. However, some terms are mistranslated or omitted (e.g., \"grounding\" is never rendered, \"In‑Context Learning\" is abbreviated without explanation). Consistency is lacking.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator attempted some cultural adaptation (using Spanish‑style questions like \"¿Verdad?\"), but the presence of untranslated French/English fragments and explanatory notes breaks immersion. The overall intent of the podcast script is only partially conveyed.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original dialogue is represented, but large portions are missing or replaced by placeholder commentary (e.g., \"Camille: translation\", \"Luc: ; verb phrase:\"). Important explanatory sentences are truncated, and the concluding remarks are incomplete.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is far from publishable. It mixes languages, contains editorial notes, and has many syntactic errors that hinder readability and fluency. While the core technical vocabulary is mostly retained, the surrounding narrative is broken, resulting in loss of nuance and coherence. A thorough rewrite by a bilingual specialist is required to produce a clean, natural Spanish version that faithfully reflects the original French podcast script.\n\n**Overall score (average of criteria): 7/20**"
