  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure, allowing readers to grasp the concepts. However, there are several grammatical slips (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenido en\", \"las conocencias\", \"las nuevas conocimientos\") that slightly impede smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural expressions and register inconsistencies (mix of formal \"Usted\" and informal \"tú\", literal French terms like \"bachotage\", and awkward phrasing such as \"Usted ha entendido todo\"). These issues make the prose feel stilted to native speakers.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly accurate: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"anclaje\" are correctly rendered. Minor problems include inconsistent translation of \"fine‑tuning\" (\"afinado\" vs. \"afinamiento\") and the retention of the French word \"bachotage\".",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and explanatory tone, but cultural adaptation is imperfect. Pronoun usage shifts between formal and informal, and some literal translations (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenido en\") feel out of place for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas from the French source are present; no major content is omitted. Minor lexical errors (\"conocencias\") do not cause loss of meaning, and no unnecessary redundancy is introduced.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core message and technical details, but suffers from noticeable fluency and style problems that reduce its naturalness. Grammatical errors, inconsistent register, and occasional untranslated French terms hinder readability for native Spanish speakers. Terminology is largely well‑handled, and the information is complete, yet the overall polish needed for a podcast script is lacking. A thorough revision focusing on idiomatic Spanish, consistent pronoun use, and correction of minor lexical mistakes would substantially improve the quality.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 75/100.\n\nStrengths: correct technical terms, complete information, faithful to the source.\nWeaknesses: fluency, register consistency, minor grammatical errors.\nRecommendations: rewrite awkward sentences, replace literal French loanwords, ensure consistent formal/informal tone, and proofread for agreement and article usage."
