    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the dialogue format is preserved. Most sentences are clear, but there are a few typographical glitches (e.g., duplicated speaker labels “Camille: Camille:” and “Luc: Luc:”), and a couple of literal translations that slightly hinder flow (“el aprendizaje en contexto, es como empollar”). These issues prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places and uses appropriate colloquial Spanish (e.g., “chuleta”). However, some constructions are awkward or overly literal (“El aprendizaje en contexto, es como empollar” instead of a more idiomatic “como preparar un examen”), and the duplicated speaker tags break the smoothness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento (fine‑tuning)”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (In‑Context Learning)”, “grounding → anclaje”. The terminology is consistent throughout and matches what a Spanish‑speaking audience familiar with AI would expect.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., using “chuleta” for cheat‑sheet). Minor issues like the duplicated labels and a few literal renderings slightly reduce the natural cultural resonance, but overall the message is conveyed effectively.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present in the Spanish version. No substantial information is lost; only formatting errors appear. The content remains complete and coherent.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. Minor editorial oversights (duplicate speaker tags, occasional literal phrasing) and a few stylistic tweaks would raise the fluency and readability. Technical terminology is spot‑on, and the essential information is fully retained, making it a high‑quality translation for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nScore (average of criteria): 17/20."
