  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to understand. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained clearly and the sentence flow is logical. Minor issues (duplicate speaker tags like “Camille: Camille:” and occasional punctuation quirks) slightly disrupt the reading experience, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, using appropriate colloquial language for a podcast. However, there are noticeable repetitions of speaker labels (e.g., “Luc: Luc:”) and a few slightly awkward phrasings (“Lo han entendido todo.”) that feel artificial. These errors prevent a completely smooth native‑speaker experience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (In‑Context Learning)” and “grounding” are translated accurately and used consistently throughout. The occasional retention of the English acronym “ICL” is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast’s informal, explanatory tone and adapts cultural references appropriately for Spanish‑speaking listeners. The intent and purpose are conveyed effectively, though the duplicated speaker tags slightly reduce the polished feel.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the structure mirrors the source. Redundancies are limited to the speaker‑label repetitions, which are technical artefacts rather than content loss.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and communicates the technical concepts clearly, maintaining the conversational podcast style. The main drawbacks are mechanical copy‑editing errors (duplicate speaker labels) and a few minor awkward phrasings that affect fluency. Apart from these issues, the terminology is spot‑on and the content is complete, making it a reliable Spanish version of the original French script.\n\n**Total score (out of 100): 84**\n\n**Strengths:** accurate terminology, clear explanations, good cultural adaptation.\n**Areas for improvement:** clean up duplicated speaker tags, smooth out occasional stiff sentences to achieve a fully natural flow."
