    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the logical flow of the original dialogue. However, there are several minor grammatical slips (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en” instead of “Hola y bienvenido a”, inconsistent use of “Usted”/“tú”) and a few clumsy constructions that slightly hinder smooth reading. Overall a native reader could follow the discussion, but the text is not as clean as it could be.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound literal and a bit stiff. Phrases such as “Usted ha entendido todo”, “antiespuesta” or “el afinado (afinado)” are unnatural in everyday Spanish. The register shifts between formal and informal, and some word choices (e.g., “bachotage”) are not idiomatic. These issues make the translation feel artificial despite being grammatically correct in many places.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly well‑handled: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, ICL, memoria a corto plazo, etc., are correctly rendered. The term “fine‑tuning” is translated as “el afinado (afinado)”, which is understandable but less common than “ajuste fino”. The explanation of “grounding” as “anclaje (anclaje)” is redundant but clear. Overall the terminology is appropriate, with only minor lexical choices that could be improved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent, but the style does not fully match the informal, conversational tone of a podcast. The switch between formal \"Usted\" and informal \"tú\" creates inconsistency, and some cultural adaptations (e.g., the opening greeting) are awkward. The core message is preserved, yet the adaptation could be smoother for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key ideas from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is lost, and the logical sequence of the discussion is retained. Minor lexical quirks (e.g., “antiespuesta”) do not omit meaning, so the content is essentially complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full content accurately and retains the technical explanations, which is its main strength. Nevertheless, the text suffers from several fluency and style issues: inconsistent register, literal phrasing, and occasional awkward word choices. A revision focusing on natural conversational Spanish, consistent pronouns, and more idiomatic equivalents for some terms would raise the overall quality substantially."
