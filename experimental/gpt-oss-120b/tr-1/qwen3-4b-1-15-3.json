  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable; the flow of ideas follows the original and complex concepts are explained. However, several typographical errors (e.g., *francen*, *francés*, *conocencias*) and occasional awkward phrasing force the reader to pause, slightly lowering smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural expressions for a native speaker: *Bienvenido* instead of *Bienvenida*, *es del cram* (un anglicismo sin adaptación), misuse of *conocencias*, and inconsistent gender agreement. Punctuation and spacing issues also detract from a natural feel.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well‑handled: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL*, *grounding* are correctly rendered and consistent. Minor lapses such as leaving *cram* untranslated and occasional anglicisms reduce the perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and adapts the examples appropriately for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Cultural nuances (e.g., consulting metaphor) are preserved. Minor gender mismatches and the untranslated English slang slightly affect cultural appropriateness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present; no major ideas are omitted. The only losses are minor nuances due to the typographical errors, but overall the information is complete and logically ordered.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the core message of the podcast and retains most of the technical content, but it suffers from several linguistic slips, typographical mistakes, and a few untranslated English terms that interrupt the reading experience. With careful proofreading and a few stylistic adjustments, the translation could reach a high level of naturalness and clarity suitable for a native audience.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
