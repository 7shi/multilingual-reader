  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure, but several typographical and lexical errors (e.g., \"despearar\" instead of \"despejar\", the French phrase \"C'est logique\" left untranslated, inconsistent use of accents) slightly impede smooth reading. The flow of ideas is clear, yet the occasional typo forces the reader to pause.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several unnatural or literal‑translation constructions: \"despearar el velo\", \"el afinado\" (instead of the more common \"afinamiento\"), and some awkward phrasing such as \"su espacio de trabajo temporal simplemente ha sido vaciado\". These make the text feel a bit stiff for native speakers, though the overall meaning is still graspable.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\". The main inconsistency is the alternating use of \"afinamiento\" and \"afinado\". Overall, the terminology is appropriate for a general‑audience podcast.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and explanatory style, but a few French fragments remain (\"C'est logique.\") and the mistranslation \"despearar\" detracts from cultural adaptation. Otherwise, the examples and analogies are suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the flow of the conversation is kept intact. Minor redundancies exist but do not affect completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning effectively. However, it is marred by several lexical mistakes, occasional French residues, and some non‑native phrasing that reduce its polish. With a careful proofread and consistent terminology, the text would be much more fluid and professional.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
