  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are short and the pedagogical flow mirrors the original. Minor typographic issues (extra spaces before punctuation, missing accent in “¿Por qué”) and a duplicated speaker label (“Camille: Camille”) cause slight hiccups, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, but there are a few literal renderings and awkward phrases (“el modelo experto en inglés”, “el ajuste fino…”, “el modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus discusiones”). The duplication of a line and occasional over‑literalism make the prose feel a bit stiff for a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is well handled: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento/ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, anclamiento (grounding). The only drawback is slight inconsistency between “afinamiento” and “ajuste fino”, but the terms are correct and consistent with the target audience’s expectations.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational style. Cultural references are neutral and appropriate for Spanish‑speaking listeners. The analogy of a consultant and the “bachotage” metaphor are kept, making the content relatable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas from the French script are present. No substantive information is omitted, and the supplementary explanations (e.g., about the “Memoria” feature) are retained. The only redundancy is the duplicated speaker label, which does not affect content completeness.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and maintains its instructional tone. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency could be polished by fixing minor typographical errors, removing the duplicated line, and smoothing a few literal phrases. Consistency in the translation of “affinage” (either ‘afinamiento’ or ‘ajuste fino’) would also improve the text. The translation is complete and well‑adapted to a Spanish‑speaking audience, making it a solid rendition with room for minor stylistic refinements.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18/20."
