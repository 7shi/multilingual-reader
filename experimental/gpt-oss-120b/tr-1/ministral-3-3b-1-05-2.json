    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is heavily interspersed with editorial notes, justification blocks, and unfinished sentences (e.g., “Camille: ¡Hola y bienvenidos” without continuation). The presence of English fragments, markdown‑style asterisks, and bracketed commentary breaks the flow, making it difficult for a Spanish‑speaking reader to follow the dialogue. Sentence structures are often fragmented, and the alternation between dialogue and meta‑explanations forces the reader to constantly re‑orient, which severely harms comprehension.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Numerous literal translations and awkward constructions appear: “las nuevas conocimientos” (gender agreement error), “el aprendizaje en contexto” (should be “aprendizaje en contexto”), “una astucia” used incorrectly, and occasional missing verbs (“Camille: pre‑entrenamiento.”). The mix of Spanish, French, and English terms within the same paragraph is unnatural for a native audience. Overall, the prose does not read smoothly and feels like a draft rather than a polished translation.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as «pré‑entraînement», «affinage», «apprentissage par transfert», «fenêtre de contexte», «apprentissage en contexte», «ICL», and «grounding» are mostly rendered correctly (pre‑entrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto). However, inconsistencies appear (e.g., “las nuevas conocimientos”, “el modelo experto en inglés y presentarle” – missing preposition). Some terms are left in English or French without explanation, which can confuse readers unfamiliar with the jargon. The handling is acceptable but not uniformly precise.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the original French conversational tone but fails to adapt it fully to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Cultural references are unchanged, and many explanatory footnotes are inserted in the middle of the dialogue, which would never appear in an actual podcast script. The occasional use of overly formal or literal phrasing (“Es una excelente observación, y es crucial entender cómo funciona esto”) feels out of place for a casual tech podcast. Hence, the adaptation is weak.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The core ideas of the French source (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the “memory” feature) are present. Nevertheless, several sentences are truncated or omitted (e.g., the opening line of Camille’s greeting is incomplete, some of Luc’s explanations are cut off, and the concluding thanks lack the original French phrasing). The excessive meta‑commentary adds noise rather than clarifying content. Important information is therefore conveyed but not cleanly nor completely.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation attempts to be literal and includes many helpful justifications, but the execution is unsuitable for a finished Spanish podcast script. The presence of editorial notes, unfinished dialogue, grammatical errors, and inconsistent terminology makes the text hard to read and unnatural. While the main technical concepts are retained, the delivery is fragmented and distracts from the intended communication. A thorough rewrite that removes the meta‑commentary, corrects grammatical issues, and adapts the tone to a conversational Spanish podcast would be necessary to reach an acceptable quality level."
