  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable. Sentences follow a logical order and the podcast dialogue is preserved. Minor issues such as stray English fragments (e.g., “And this learning begins…”) and duplicated speaker tags slightly interrupt flow, but a native reader can still follow the content without major difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly sounds natural, but there are several awkward spots: mixed English/Spanish in the same sentence, unnecessary asterisks before speaker names, and occasional literal renderings (e.g., “una antisèche”). These reduce the smoothness expected from a native‑speaker text.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled. ‘pre‑entrenamiento’, ‘fine‑tuning’, ‘aprendizaje por transferencia’, ‘ventana de contexto’, ‘ICL (Aprendizaje In‑Context)’ and ‘anclaje’ are correctly translated and used consistently. A few English terms remain in parentheses, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original podcast tone to Spanish (greeting, informal dialogue, examples) and respects cultural expectations. The only drawback is the occasional retention of English formatting, which slightly breaks immersion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French source are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent knowledge distinction, and the explanation of ‘memory’ features. No substantive content is omitted, though a few minor phrasing errors introduce tiny ambiguities.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original message accurately and keeps the technical discussion clear. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency suffers from occasional code‑switching and formatting artifacts. Minor polishing would bring it to a near‑native level.\n\nTotal score: 83/100.\n\nStrengths: correct technical vocabulary, faithful content transfer, appropriate adaptation to a podcast format.\nWeaknesses: mixed-language fragments, redundant speaker markers, and a few unnatural phrasings that affect fluidity.\n\nRecommendation: edit out the residual English text, remove the extra asterisks, and smooth out the few literal translations to achieve full naturalness.\n\nScore out of 100: 83"
