  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is difficult to follow because it contains many out‑of‑place annotations (e.g., “Spanish translation result”, “French to Spanish translation result”), English fragments left untranslated, and occasional duplicated sentences. These interruptions break the flow and force the reader to re‑orient repeatedly.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are numerous unnatural constructions (“You got it right.”, “On peut dire ça.”, literal translation of “prompt”), and the mix of languages creates a jarring experience. Vocabulary is generally correct but the syntax often feels forced or literal.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto* and *ICL* are correctly rendered. However, some terms remain in English (e.g., “prompt”, “grounding” is only partially translated) and a few French technical words are left untranslated, reducing consistency.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator largely preserves the original intent and tone, but the inserted meta‑comments and untranslated snippets detract from cultural adaptation. Some idiomatic Spanish equivalents could have been used (e.g., “bachotaje” instead of “bachotage”).",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The majority of the original information is present, but several passages are missing or replaced by placeholder notes, and a few nuances (like the explanation of “memoria” features) are less clear because of the interruptions.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core ideas but is far from publishable. It suffers from numerous leftover editorial notes, mixed‑language fragments, and occasional literal renderings that hinder readability and fluency. Technical terminology is mostly correct, yet consistency issues remain. A thorough clean‑up—removing placeholders, fully translating all French/English segments, and polishing the prose for natural Spanish—would be required to reach a high‑quality standard.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 10/20."
