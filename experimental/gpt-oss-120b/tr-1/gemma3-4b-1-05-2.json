    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but many sentences are awkward, contain typographical errors, missing accents, and occasional duplication (e.g., \"Luc: Luc:\"). Literal translations like \"Mire:\" and the nonsensical phrase \"El aprendizaje en contexto es bachore\" impede smooth comprehension. Despite these issues, a native speaker can follow the main ideas.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds stilted in many places. It mixes literal French‑Spanish calques, retains English fragments (\"ICL\", \"prompt\"), and includes grammatical mistakes (missing articles, wrong verb forms). Phrases such as \"Así es la persistencia de las cuales, para siempre?\" are ungrammatical. Overall, the prose does not flow naturally for a native Spanish listener.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well‑handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\" are appropriate. Some inconsistencies appear (\"el afinado\" vs \"afinamiento\") and a few English terms are left untranslated, but the core terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and explanatory tone, but cultural and linguistic adaptation is limited. Literal renderings and odd phrasing reduce the natural fit for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Nevertheless, the key messages about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are conveyed.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all information from the French script is present. Minor losses include the English sentence \"That's exactly right\" and occasional duplication errors. No major content is omitted, and the overall structure mirrors the source.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main ideas of the podcast episode and uses correct technical vocabulary, but suffers from numerous fluency and readability problems due to literal translations, typographical errors, and occasional missing or garbled phrases. A reader can grasp the concepts, yet the text feels unpolished and would benefit from thorough proofreading and stylistic revision to sound natural in Spanish.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 13/20."
