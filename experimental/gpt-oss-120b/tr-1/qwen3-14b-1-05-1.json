  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can understand. Minor punctuation issues (e.g., missing accent in \"¿Porque\") do not hinder comprehension, but they slightly affect smooth reading.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are a few awkward expressions: \"se acuerda\" (instead of \"recuerda\"), \"afinamiento\" (less common than \"ajuste fino\"), and occasional word order that feels literal from French. These quirks prevent it from being completely native‑like.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"memoria\" etc. The choice of \"afinamiento\" for fine‑tuning is consistent, though not the most usual Spanish term; still the meaning is clear. \"Anclaje\" for grounding is appropriate. Overall term usage is coherent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts the examples to a Spanish‑speaking audience without cultural loss. Small issues like the use of \"acuerda\" instead of a more idiomatic verb do not change the meaning, so the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant content has been omitted or altered, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue faithfully.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is of high quality. It conveys the full content accurately, uses appropriate technical vocabulary, and is largely readable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor fluency issues (word choice, occasional missing accents) prevent a perfect score, but they do not impede understanding. The translator demonstrated good grasp of both the subject matter and the target language.\n\n**Strengths:** completeness, accurate terminology, clear exposition of complex ideas. **Areas for improvement:** polish native‑speaker phrasing (e.g., prefer \"recuerda\" over \"se acuerda\"), use more common Spanish equivalents for \"fine‑tuning\" (\"ajuste fino\"), and watch for diacritical marks.\n\n**Final average score:** 17.8/20."
