  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the dialogue format is preserved, making the technical discussion accessible. Minor long sentences could be split, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, but there are a few grammatical slips (e.g., \"partes de un contexto vacío\" should be \"parte de un contexto vacío\", \"cramming\" left in English, and occasional literal constructions). These do not break the flow but slightly reduce native‑speaker naturalness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\". The occasional retention of English words like \"prompt\" and \"cramming\" is acceptable for a tech‑savvy audience, and the term \"grounding\" is explained with its Spanish equivalent.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast tone, cultural references and analogies (consultor brillante, aprendizaje de bicicleta, etc.). Adaptations are appropriate for Spanish‑speaking listeners, with no loss of intent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is conveyed. No major ideas are omitted; only minor stylistic choices (e.g., leaving \"cramming\" untranslated) could be refined, but they do not affect the factual content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It faithfully transmits the technical content and conversational style, with clear explanations and consistent terminology. A few minor grammatical and lexical slips prevent it from being perfect, but they do not impede understanding. The translation would be well received by a Spanish‑speaking tech‑interested audience.\nOverall score: 18/20."
