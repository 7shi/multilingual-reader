  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear order. Sentences are generally short enough for easy comprehension, and complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto are explained with relatable analogies. Minor hiccups (e.g., occasional formal ‘Ustedes’ in a conversational podcast) do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for native speakers. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, and most idiomatic expressions are well‑chosen. A few phrasing choices are slightly stiff – for instance, “Ustedes lo han entendido todo” could be more colloquial – but overall the language is smooth and engaging.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, anclaje (grounding). The translator kept the English acronyms where needed and provided Spanish equivalents, preserving precision throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the podcast’s informal, explanatory tone and adapts cultural references suitably (e.g., using “chuleta” for cheat‑sheet). The switch from French to Spanish retains the original intent and makes the content relatable to Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original dialogue are present: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent nature of knowledge, and the explanation of “memoria” features. No relevant information was omitted or distorted.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately while remaining accessible and engaging for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve conversational fluency, but they do not detract from the clarity or correctness of the translation.\n\nStrengths: precise terminology, faithful content transfer, clear explanations, good cultural adaptation. Areas for improvement: smooth out a few formal or slightly awkward expressions to better match the podcast’s informal style.\n\nThe translation effectively bridges the original French technical discussion to a Spanish audience without loss of meaning or nuance.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 92/100."
