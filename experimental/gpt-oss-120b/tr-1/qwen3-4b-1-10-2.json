    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and conveys the main ideas. Most sentences are clear, and the technical concepts are explained similarly to the original. However, there are a few minor issues that slightly hinder smooth reading, such as the preposition error in \"Hola y bienvenido en\" (should be \"a\"), the occasional mixed formal/informal pronouns, and a couple of redundant commas. These do not block comprehension but affect fluidity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several expressions feel literal or awkward: \"Usted ha entendido todo\" is stilted, \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es un aprendizaje superficial\" contains a misplaced comma and a slightly odd phrasing, and the retention of the French term \"ancrage\" feels out of place. Small lexical choices like \"consultor\" vs \"consultora\" are fine, but the mix of English terms (fine‑tuning) and Spanish reduces the natural flow. Overall, a native speaker would notice these hiccups.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and understandable: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are correct. The translation keeps \"fine‑tuning\" as \"afinamiento\", which is acceptable, but it leaves the French word \"ancrage\" untranslated, where a Spanish equivalent like \"anclaje\" or \"enraizamiento\" would be preferable. Consistency is mostly good, with minor lapses.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original podcast are well preserved. The translation adapts the conversational style to Spanish, and cultural references remain appropriate. Minor issues such as the preposition error mentioned earlier and the use of French terminology slightly detract from full adaptation, but they do not change the meaning.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted, and the logical sequence of the discussion is maintained. The only minor loss is the nuance of the word \"grounding\" that is not fully explained because the term \"ancrage\" is left unchanged, but the surrounding context still conveys the meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. It is readable and complete, but occasional literal translations, a few grammatical slips, and the retention of a French term prevent it from reaching a fully native‑speaker level of fluency. Minor revisions—correcting prepositions, smoothing out formal/informal pronoun usage, translating \"ancrage\" to a Spanish equivalent, and polishing punctuation—would raise the quality considerably."
