  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logical and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto) are clear. A few long sentences are slightly dense, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward phrasings (e.g., “la gran cuestión que debe hacerse toda persona que utilice estas herramientas es”, “Ella olvida todo”), a typo (“conocimencias” instead of “conocimientos”), and the brand name is changed to “Tech Flash”, which feels unnecessary. These issues lower the native‑speaker smoothness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered and consistently used: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclamiento (grounding). The translator kept the jargon appropriate for a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original podcast are preserved. Minor cultural adaptation (changing “Tech Éclair” to “Tech Flash”) is not required and slightly alters the brand identity, but overall the message is conveyed correctly for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of the “memory” feature. No substantive information is omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the technical content well. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency suffers from a few awkward constructions and a typo. The change of the podcast name is an unnecessary adaptation. The translation would be rated as high‑quality with minor revisions needed for naturalness and proofreading.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 17/20."
