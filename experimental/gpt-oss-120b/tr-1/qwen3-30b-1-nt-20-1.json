  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are clear and the flow of ideas mirrors the original French dialogue. A few long sentences could be split for better readability, but overall a native Spanish reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, using appropriate colloquial expressions for a podcast format. Small awkward constructions appear, e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje” (should be “…es como el bachotaje”) and occasional over‑use of French‑style guillemets « ». These do not break comprehension but slightly reduce the native feel.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, anclaje (grounding). The terminology is consistent throughout and matches what Spanish‑speaking professionals would expect. Only minor issues such as the occasional literal translation of “memory” function, but the meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal, conversational tone of the podcast and adapts cultural references appropriately. The use of exclamation marks and the Spanish‑language equivalents of idioms (e.g., “¡Exactamente!”) works well. The presence of French guillemets is a minor stylistic inconsistency, but it does not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present. No ideas or examples are omitted, and the supplementary explanations added in the original (e.g., analogies) are retained. The translation is faithful and complete.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the podcast’s engaging style, and is easy for Spanish speakers to understand. Minor stylistic and phrasing issues prevent it from being perfect, but they are limited to a few isolated sentences.\n\nThe translation could be improved by smoothing a couple of awkward expressions and by replacing the French guillemets with Spanish quotation marks, but these are small refinements rather than major flaws.\n\nScore out of 20: 17\n\nOverall rating: 17/20 – a very good translation with room for slight polishing to reach native‑level fluency."
