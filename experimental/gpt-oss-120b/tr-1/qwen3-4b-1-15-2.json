  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences are clear, but occasional typographical errors (e.g., “francen” instead of “francés”, “conocencias” instead of “conocimientos”) and a few awkward constructions slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several non‑native expressions: “es del cram” (literal translation of “cram”), “conocencias” (non‑existent word), and some clumsy phrasing such as “la IA no tiene ninguna idea de lo que se dijo antes”. These make the translation feel stilted in places, even though the overall meaning is retained.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL. The term “grounding” is left in English, which is acceptable in a technical context. The main flaw is the misspelling of “francés”, which could confuse readers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast tone and intent, adapting cultural references appropriately for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor literal translations (e.g., “consultor brillante”) are acceptable, and the overall message about temporary vs. permanent knowledge is conveyed effectively.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original. The only losses are minor due to typographical errors, which do not affect factual content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in delivering the technical content and podcast style to a Spanish audience, but it suffers from several linguistic slip‑ups that reduce its naturalness. Correcting the typographical errors and refining awkward phrases would raise the fluency considerably. Technical terminology is well‑handled overall, and the message is complete.\n\nStrengths: accurate conveyance of concepts, good handling of specialized vocabulary, faithful retention of original structure.\nWeaknesses: typographical mistakes, occasional non‑native phrasing, minor inconsistencies in word choice.\n\nWith a few edits, this could become a very high‑quality Spanish version of the episode.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16.2 → rounded to 16 out of 20.\n\nRecommended actions: proofread for typos, replace “conocencias” with “conocimientos”, rephrase “es del cram” to “es de apretar” or similar, and ensure all proper nouns (e.g., “francés”) are spelled correctly.\n\nScore: 16/20"
