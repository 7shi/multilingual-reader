  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas without major ambiguities. Minor typographical errors such as \"Es donc\" (should be \"Es, pues,\") and a missing ‘r’ in \"Trasfiere\" slightly interrupt flow, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, using appropriate colloquial constructions for a podcast script. Some phrasing feels a bit stiff or literal, e.g., \"aprendizaje contextualizado automático\" and the occasional awkward order of words. Overall, a native speaker would understand it, though a few sentences could be smoother.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (aprendizaje en contexto)\". The translation of \"grounding\" as \"enraizado\" is acceptable, though \"anclaje\" is more common in Spanish AI literature. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using familiar podcast‑style language. The retention of the original French podcast name at the end (\"Tech Éclair\") may feel out of place for some listeners, but it preserves branding. Cultural references are neutral, so no major misalignments appear.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present. No ideas are omitted, and the explanations remain intact. The only drawbacks are minor typographical glitches that do not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does an excellent job of conveying the original podcast script to a Spanish‑speaking audience. It is readable, largely fluent, and retains the technical depth required. Minor typographical errors and a few slightly literal translations keep it from being perfect, but the overall quality is high and the content is fully preserved.\n\nStrengths: clear communication of complex AI concepts, consistent terminology, faithful content transfer. Areas for improvement: polish occasional awkward phrasing, correct small typos, consider more idiomatic equivalents for certain technical neologisms (e.g., \"grounding\").\n\nOverall, the work is strong and would be well understood by the target audience with only minimal editing needed.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 17/20"
