    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original French script. Listeners can understand the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning without major obstacles. Minor typographical issues (e.g., stray parentheses after “Exactamente.” and “preentrenamiento)”) slightly disrupt reading, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few literal constructions feel awkward to a native speaker: \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es memorización\" (unnecessary comma), \"chuleta\" (colloquial slang that may feel out of place in a tech podcast), and the dangling parenthesis after \"Exactamente.\"). Overall the language is smooth, but these hiccups prevent a perfect fluency rating.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje\" for grounding are appropriate and consistent. The acronym ICL is retained and explained, which helps the target audience. No critical terminology is mistranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using familiar expressions like \"consultor brillante\" and preserving the podcast’s informal tone. Some phrases remain overly literal from French (e.g., \"es una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\"), but the overall intent and register are well conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key points of the original dialogue are present: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No substantive information is omitted, and the structure mirrors the source.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and faithful to the original French script. It conveys the technical concepts clearly, uses appropriate terminology, and keeps the conversational tone of the podcast. Minor typographical glitches and a few slightly stiff literal renderings prevent a perfect score, but the overall quality is high and would be easily understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI technologies.\n\nOverall Score: 17/20"
