  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and conveys the main ideas of the French script. Most sentences are clear and the flow of the dialogue is maintained. A few sentences (e.g., “¿Quieres decir?” instead of a neutral “C’est‑à‑dire ?” and the question “¿Por qué ya comprende…?”) slightly alter the nuance, but they do not prevent comprehension. Overall, a native reader can understand the content without major difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation sounds natural, but there are several noticeable awkward constructions: “Eso es exactamente eso” is redundant, “sillón” instead of “bicicleta” is a clear lexical error, and the phrase “¿Quieres decir?” changes the tone of the original. These issues make the text feel a little stilted in places, though the majority of the dialogue flows smoothly.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “ICL”, and “grounding” are correctly translated and kept consistent. No important technical concept is mistranslated or omitted, which helps maintain the specialist tone of the podcast.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience, and the analogy with a consultant is kept intact. Minor deviations (e.g., the shift from a neutral clarification to a question) do not affect the overall message. The adaptation is therefore effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A crucial segment is truncated: after “Las nuevas” the sentence is cut off, so the explanation of how fine‑tuning changes the model’s internal structure is incomplete. Additionally, the small nuance loss in a couple of exchanges slightly reduces fidelity. Because of the missing fragment, the completeness score is lowered.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the core content of the French podcast into Spanish. Technical vocabulary is accurate and the overall structure is preserved. However, a few linguistic slip‑ups (redundant phrasing, a lexical mistake, and a missing sentence fragment) prevent it from being fully polished. With minor revisions—especially fixing the truncated passage and smoothing out the awkward expressions—the translation would be excellent.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15.8/20."
