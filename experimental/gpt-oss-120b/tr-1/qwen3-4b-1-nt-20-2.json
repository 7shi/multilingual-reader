  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the structure of the original dialogue. However, there are several grammatical slips (e.g., \"bienvenido en\" instead of \"bienvenido a\", \"conversión única\" instead of \"conversación única\", misspelling \"conocencias\") and occasional awkward phrasing that can momentarily confuse the reader.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds fairly natural but suffers from inconsistent register (mix of \"Usted\" and \"tú\"), literal translations (e.g., \"bachotage\" left in French), and some clunky constructions (\"Usted ha entendido todo\", \"Esta aproximación se llama aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en contexto)\"). Native speakers would notice these hiccups.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinado\" for fine‑tuning, \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\". The term \"prompt\" is left in English, which is acceptable in current tech discourse. Overall terminology is consistent and appropriate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and maintains the explanatory tone of the podcast. Minor cultural‑linguistic mismatches (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenido en\") do not change meaning but reduce the natural feel. The overall adaptation is good.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are present; no substantive information is lost. The only issues are minor lexical errors that do not affect the conveyed content. The translation is complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning. It retains the structure of the original dialogue and the essential concepts. The main drawbacks are occasional grammatical mistakes, inconsistent use of formal/informal pronouns, and a few literal or awkward phrasings that affect fluency. Technical terminology is well‑handled, and no major information is omitted. With a light edit to fix the grammatical slips and smooth the register, the text would read like a natural Spanish podcast script.\nOverall, the work is good but not yet polished, landing around the mid‑teens on a 0‑20 scale.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15 out of 20."
