    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original. Most sentences are easy to understand, and complex concepts are explained with appropriate examples. However, a few expressions are awkward or non‑standard (e.g., “bacar para un examen”, “antisèche”, “silla” instead of “asiento” or “bicicleta”), which can momentarily disrupt comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places and uses correct grammar. There are occasional literal renderings that sound odd to native speakers (“bacar”, “antisèche”, “silla”). These do not break the text but reduce the smoothness expected in a fluent podcast script.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" are correctly translated and consistently used. The term \"grounding\" is rendered as \"anclaje\", which is acceptable. Minor issues are the retention of French‑origin words like “antisèche”, but they do not impair technical understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone of a conversational podcast. Cultural references are mostly preserved, and the explanations stay appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The few non‑native terms (\"bacar\", \"antisèche\") slightly reduce the cultural fit.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present. No major ideas are omitted, and the examples (e.g., English‑to‑French transfer, consultant analogy) are fully retained. Redundancy is minimal, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. It is readable and mostly fluent, with correct handling of terminology. Minor lexical choices (like \"bacar\" and \"antisèche\") and a few literal renderings prevent it from being completely natural, but they do not hinder understanding. The translation would benefit from substituting those terms with more common Spanish equivalents (e.g., \"empollar\", \"chuleta\", \"asiento\"), which would raise the readability and fluency scores further.\n\n**Total score:** 83/100 (average 16.6/20 per criterion). The work is high‑quality and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience after a light edit to smooth out the few awkward expressions."
