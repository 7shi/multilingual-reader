    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and the dialogue format is preserved. Most sentences are clear, and the technical ideas are explained in plain language. However, there are a few typographical errors (e.g., “crammar”, “Trasfiere”) and awkward phrasing (“el afinado”) that slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but occasional literal renderings and misspellings make it feel slightly robotic. Phrases like “ventana de contexto” and “aprendizaje en contexto” are idiomatic, yet the misuse of “afinado” (a Portuguese word) and the typo “crammar” stand out as non‑native errors. Overall a native reader would understand it, but it is not completely fluent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly rendered (preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, grounding, memoria a corto plazo). The occasional inconsistency (“afinado” instead of “afinamiento”) is a minor flaw, but the terminology remains accurate and consistent throughout.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French podcast tone to Spanish well, using appropriate salutations and cultural references. The explanation of concepts is kept accessible for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor lexical choices (e.g., “consultor brillante”) are appropriate. Overall the intent and purpose are fully conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, temporary vs permanent knowledge, and the simulated “memory” feature. No significant content is omitted, though the small typographical errors slightly affect precision.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the original podcast’s content and technical depth into Spanish. It maintains the conversational structure and explains complex AI concepts clearly. The main drawbacks are a handful of typographical and lexical slips that affect readability and fluency. With a quick proof‑read to correct those errors, the translation would be excellent for a Spanish‑speaking audience seeking an accessible overview of AI training methods."
