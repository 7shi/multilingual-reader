  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow and the dialogue structure is preserved. Most sentences are clear, and the technical explanations remain understandable. However, there are a few typographical glitches (e.g., an isolated line \"Luc: funciones de memorización\" without continuation) that slightly disrupt the flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places and uses appropriate colloquial Spanish. Some constructions are a bit stiff or missing verbs (e.g., \"funciones de memorización\" and \"funciones de memorización son una forma astuta...\"), which makes the phrasing sound slightly awkward to a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", and \"anclaje\" are accurate and consistent. The English acronyms (ICL, fine‑tuning) are kept and explained, which is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are neutral, and examples (consultor brillante, aprender a andar en bicicleta) are well adapted. Minor omissions (the truncated line) prevent a perfect adaptation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, transfer learning, fine‑tuning vs. in‑context learning, temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the “memory” feature. The only loss is the incomplete sentence after \"Luc: funciones de memorización\", which slightly reduces completeness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is very good. It conveys the technical content accurately, uses appropriate terminology, and remains largely readable and natural for Spanish‑speaking listeners. The main drawbacks are a couple of minor typographical/grammatical slips and a truncated line that slightly affect fluency and completeness. With a quick proofread to fix those hiccups, the translation would be excellent.\nScore out of 20 (average of the five criteria): 16.6 ≈ 17."
