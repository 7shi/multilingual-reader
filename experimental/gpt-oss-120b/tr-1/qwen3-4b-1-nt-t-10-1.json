  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable; the flow of ideas mirrors the original French script and most sentences are clear. However, a few awkward truncations (e.g., “Voy” instead of the full “¡Veo!”) and occasional missing punctuation make the reading experience slightly choppy. The core concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are conveyed, so a reader can follow the discussion without major confusion.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation feels semi‑natural. Most vocabulary is appropriate, but there are several non‑native constructions: “Hola y bienvenido en”, “Usted ha entendido todo.” (missing exclamation), “es aprovechamiento” for “bachotage”, the English word “Simply” left in the text, and inconsistent use of formal vs. informal pronouns. These hiccups break the fluidity for a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally rendered correctly (preentrenamiento, afinamiento/fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, etc.). Some terms could be improved: “afinamiento” is acceptable but “ajuste fino” is more common; “aprovechamiento” does not capture the nuance of “bachotage”. Overall the terminology is consistent and understandable for the intended audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the podcast tone and keeps the conversational style. Cultural adaptation is adequate – the Spanish speaker would understand the consultant analogy, the “memoria” feature, etc. Minor issues like the literal translation of “consultor temporal” vs. a more natural “consultor a corto plazo” are present, but they do not distort the intent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the “memory” hack. No substantive content is omitted, and the translation does not add irrelevant material. The only loss is a tiny fragment where “Voy” is left incomplete, which slightly reduces completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content and the podcast’s informal dialogue quite well, but it suffers from several fluency glitches and a few inaccurate word choices. The terminology is mostly on point, and the information is complete. With a careful proofreading pass to fix truncations, punctuation, and a few awkward expressions, the version would be fluent and natural for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15.6/20, rounded to 16/20."
