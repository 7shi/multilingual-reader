  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and conveys the ideas clearly. Sentences are generally well‑structured, and the technical concepts are explained in a way a non‑expert can grasp. Minor issues such as occasional overly long sentences slightly reduce smoothness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but the presence of markdown‑style bold (** **), parenthetical notes about “versión más natural” and the inconsistent use of colloquial interjections like “Miren:” make it feel less like a spoken podcast script and more like a written draft. These affect overall fluidity.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *ICL*, *grounding*, *anclaje* are all correctly rendered, with occasional English in parentheses for clarity. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The core intent of the original is preserved, but the podcast name is changed inconsistently (“Tech Destello”, then “Tecno Relámpago”) which can confuse listeners. Extra meta‑comments (e.g., “Traducción al español (versión final)”) are unnecessary for the target audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All substantive information from the French source is present; no essential content is omitted. The translation even adds a few explanatory parentheticals that do not alter meaning, so completeness is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is accurate and conveys the technical content effectively. Readability and terminology are strong points, while fluency and cultural adaptation could be improved by removing markdown markers, extraneous notes, and ensuring consistent naming of the podcast. The translation would benefit from a final polish to sound like a natural spoken script in Spanish.\nOverall score (out of 100): 82/100."
