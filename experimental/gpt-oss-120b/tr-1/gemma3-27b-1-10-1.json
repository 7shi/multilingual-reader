  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version flows logically and all concepts are explained clearly. Sentences are short enough for easy comprehension and the dialogue format is preserved. Minor typographic quirks (e.g., “pre‑entrenamiento” with a hyphen) do not hinder understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for native speakers. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. A few expressions are slightly literal (“cuando abres una nueva ventana”) but they are still perfectly understandable. Overall the text reads smoothly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: “ajuste fino” for fine‑tuning, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto” and the acronym ICL are kept. The English word “grounding” is left in quotes, which is acceptable in a tech podcast context. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator respects the original intent and tone, adapting cultural references (e.g., using “hola” and “bienvenidos”). The explanatory style is kept, and the audience‑focused approach of the podcast is preserved. No culturally inappropriate phrasing is introduced.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No sentences or ideas are omitted, and no unnecessary repetitions are added. The essential distinctions between fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are fully retained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It faithfully conveys the original content, maintains the technical accuracy, and reads naturally for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but they do not affect comprehension. Overall, the work demonstrates strong command of both languages and the subject matter.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.4 → rounded to 18 out of 20."
