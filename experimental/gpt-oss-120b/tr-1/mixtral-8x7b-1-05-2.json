    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logical and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are clear. Minor issues such as the occasional long sentence and the retention of the French word “ancrage” slightly reduce smoothness, but the overall comprehension for a Spanish‑speaking audience is good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are a few awkward constructions and grammatical slips: “el IA” (gender error), capitalisation of “Inteligencia Artificial” mid‑sentence, and some overly literal phrasing (“una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”). These errors make the text feel less native‑like.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje de transferencia”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje en contexto”. The term “grounding” is left as the French “ancrage”, which may confuse readers. Overall terminology is consistent and appropriate for the intended audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original conversational tone and intent. Cultural references are adapted well, but the retention of the French word “ancrage” and occasional literal translations reduce the natural fit for Spanish listeners. The adaptation is solid but not perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas and details from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No important information is omitted, and the examples (consultant, “chuleta”, etc.) are retained. The content remains complete and coherent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and keeps the technical explanations understandable. Readability and completeness are strong points. Fluency suffers from a few grammatical errors and the occasional untranslated French term, which slightly detracts from the naturalness of the Spanish version. With minor polishing—especially fixing gender agreement and translating ‘ancrage’—the translation would reach a higher level of polish.\n\nScore out of 100: 78/100."
