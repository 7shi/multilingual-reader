    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is highly fragmented. Many lines are incomplete (e.g., \"Luc: exponer,\" \"Camille: Hola y bienvenidos…\" followed by a sudden switch to English meta‑comments). The flow of the conversation is broken, punctuation is missing, and the reader has to guess missing verbs or clauses. As a result, a native Spanish reader would struggle to follow the dialogue.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Numerous unnatural expressions appear: literal translations such as \"brindarle una base de conocimientos\" without a subject, mixed English/French fragments, and placeholders like \"* **\" that belong to the translation‑review notes. Vocabulary choices are inconsistent and many sentences lack proper verb conjugation, making the text sound like a draft rather than a polished script.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled inconsistently. \"pre-entrenamiento\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correct, but \"fine-tuning\" is left in English, sometimes rendered as \"ajuste fino\" and other times just \"fine‑tuning\". The term \"ICL\" is not explained in Spanish. Meta‑comments about translation choices distract from the actual terminology. This inconsistency reduces clarity for the target audience.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to adapt the podcast tone to Spanish‑speaking listeners. It retains French‑style phrasing, includes English editorial notes, and does not adjust cultural references or idiomatic speech. The intended friendly, explanatory style of the original is lost, and the occasional Spanish‑English code‑switching would feel jarring to the audience.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are omitted or replaced by reviewer notes (e.g., \"Luc: You're right,\" \"Camille: window of discussion,\" etc.). Important explanations about memory, in‑context learning, and the difference between fine‑tuning and prompting are either truncated or missing. Consequently, the core content is not fully conveyed.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is far from publishable. It reads like a mixture of a rough draft and a translation‑review document, with many gaps, untranslated fragments, and intrusive meta‑comments. To be usable, it would require a complete rewrite: reconstruct the dialogue in fluent Spanish, ensure consistent technical terminology, remove all editorial notes, and preserve the explanatory flow of the original podcast script."
