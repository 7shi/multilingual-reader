  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor issues such as duplicated speaker labels (e.g., \"Camille: Camille:\" and \"Luc: Luc:\") and occasional clunky phrasing slightly interrupt the flow, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, using appropriate colloquial language for a podcast. A few awkward constructions (e.g., \"Cuando abre una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío\") and the repeated tags make it feel slightly less smooth than native speech.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\", etc. Consistency is maintained throughout, and the terms chosen are appropriate for a general‑audience audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal, conversational tone of the original podcast and adapts cultural references (e.g., \"chuleta\" for \"antisèche\") appropriately. The only detractor is the literal duplication of speaker tags, which slightly reduces the natural feel.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is retained. No significant content is omitted or altered, and the supplemental explanations (e.g., analogies) remain intact. Redundancy is minimal aside from the duplicated labels.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate, comprehensive, and conveys the original intent effectively. Minor typographical and stylistic issues (mainly duplicated speaker identifiers and a few slightly awkward sentences) keep it from being flawless, but they do not affect the listener’s understanding. The handling of technical terms is solid, and the adaptation to Spanish-speaking listeners feels natural and engaging.\n\n**Overall Score (out of 20): 17**"
