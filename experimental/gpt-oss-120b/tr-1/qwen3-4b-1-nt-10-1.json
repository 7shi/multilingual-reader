    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Most sentences convey the original ideas clearly, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in a straightforward manner. Minor hiccups (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en…”, mixed formal/informal pronouns) do not severely impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, but there are occasional awkward constructions: “Usted ha entendido todo.” (mixes formal “usted” with a casual tone), “La diferencia entre bachear…”, and the fragmented sentence about the new “Mémoire” feature. These reduce the overall smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and the use of the original English acronyms. The translation of “grounding” as “anclaje (sosténance)” is acceptable, though a single term would suffice. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the podcast’s informal, conversational tone, but the shift between “tú” and “usted” creates inconsistency. Additionally, a line about the new “Mémoire” feature is broken (\"Camille: , que algunas IA…\"), which disrupts the flow and loses part of the original nuance.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French source are present: pre‑training, transfer learning, fine‑tuning vs. in‑context learning, temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the “memory” tricks. The only noticeable loss is the incomplete question about the new “Mémoire” functionality, which slightly reduces completeness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. It is readable and mostly fluent, with correct handling of terminology. The main weaknesses are occasional pronoun inconsistency, a few unnatural phrasings, and a truncated sentence that omits part of a question about new memory features. Fixing these issues would bring the translation to a near‑native level.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16.0 out of 20."
