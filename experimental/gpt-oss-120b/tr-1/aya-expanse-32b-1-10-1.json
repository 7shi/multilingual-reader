  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow; sentences are well‑structured and the concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained clearly. Minor typographic issues such as the hyphen in “pre‑entrenamiento” do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural, but a few expressions feel foreign or slightly awkward: “una antisèche” (French word kept), “el pre‑entrenamiento” (hyphenated), and occasional literal renderings that sound stiff. Nevertheless, a native reader would understand everything without effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly. Key terms like “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, and the acronym ICL are preserved or translated appropriately. The use of “anclaje” for “grounding” is acceptable, and English acronyms are left unchanged, which is standard in the field.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The informal podcast tone is maintained, and cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only lapse is the retention of the French word “antisèche” instead of a Spanish equivalent (“chuleta”, “apunte”). Otherwise the adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present; no ideas are omitted or altered. The translation conveys the same examples, analogies, and explanations, keeping the content complete and coherent.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is very good. It conveys the technical content accurately and keeps the conversational style of the podcast. Minor lexical choices (e.g., retaining a French term and a hyphenated word) prevent a perfect fluency score, but they do not affect understanding. The translation would be well received by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nStrengths: clear exposition of complex ideas, consistent terminology, faithful preservation of the original message.\nWeaknesses: occasional non‑native expressions and a retained French word that could be localized.\nOverall rating reflects a strong, professional translation with only small room for refinement.\n\nScore out of 20 (average of the five criteria, rounded): 17.8 → 18/20."
