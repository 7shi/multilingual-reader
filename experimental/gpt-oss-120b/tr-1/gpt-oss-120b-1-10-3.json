  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto) are clear. Minor issues arise from occasional formal‑informal shifts (e.g., \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\" vs. \"lo has entendido\") which may cause a slight hiccup for the reader, but the overall comprehension is not affected.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward or overly formal constructions that a native speaker would phrase differently (e.g., \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\", \"Una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\"). The mix of \"usted\" and \"tú\" is inconsistent, which slightly reduces the fluidity. Vocabulary choices are appropriate, yet the style could be smoother.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento (fine‑tuning), aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL (In‑Context Learning), anclaje (grounding). The occasional retention of the English acronym with a Spanish explanation is helpful and consistent. No key term is mistranslated or omitted.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone (podcast‑like, explanatory) and cultural relevance for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic issues (formal vs. informal pronouns) prevent a perfect adaptation, but overall the content feels natural and appropriate for the target listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No sentences or concepts are omitted, and the supplemental parenthetical explanations (e.g., ICL (In‑Context Learning)) aid understanding without adding redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the technical content effectively. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency and stylistic consistency could be improved, particularly regarding pronoun usage and occasional overly formal phrasing. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience.\n\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 89/100."
