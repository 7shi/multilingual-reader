  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is frequently interrupted by English and French fragments such as “Spanish translation result”, “You got it right”, and a whole French sentence that was never translated. These intrusions break the flow and force the reader to pause, making the overall comprehension difficult. While the correctly translated portions are clear, the presence of untranslated material prevents a smooth reading experience.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Even in the parts that are in Spanish, the phrasing is sometimes stilted (“la IA no ha 'olvidado' en el sentido humano del término; su espacio de trabajo temporal simplemente se ha vaciado”) and there are literal translations that sound awkward. The mixture of languages and placeholder notes makes the text feel unpolished and unnatural for a native speaker.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto” and “aprendizaje en contexto” are correctly rendered. However, some terms remain in English (“grounding”) or French, and a few explanations that were present in the original are lost. Consistency is decent but not perfect.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally preserves the original intent, but the presence of untranslated sections and literal placeholders reduces cultural relevance. Certain idiomatic expressions could be improved (e.g., “es como enviar a este graduado a seguir una especialización” could be smoother). Overall, the adaptation is incomplete.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original dialogue is present, but several sentences are omitted or replaced by meta‑comments (“Spanish translation result”, “French to Spanish translation result”). Important explanatory remarks from the original are therefore missing, leading to slight information loss.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the core ideas and most technical vocabulary, but it is marred by numerous untranslated fragments, placeholder notes, and occasional awkward phrasing. These issues significantly impair readability and fluency, and they cause minor information gaps. A thorough revision is needed to remove the mixed‑language artifacts, smooth the Spanish prose, and ensure that every original point is fully conveyed in natural Spanish.\nOverall quality: below average; the text is not ready for publication without substantial editing.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 9.2 → 9/20."
