    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences are clear, and complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje y aprendizaje en contexto are explained in an accessible way. Minor issues (e.g., occasional long sentences and a few punctuation quirks) slightly affect flow, but overall a French‑speaking audience would understand without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally, but there are several awkward choices: “afinado” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”, the incorrect abbreviation “AIC” (instead of ICL), the typo “ACL”, and the non‑standard “ancoraje” (should be “anclaje”). These errors create brief moments of unnaturalness for native Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly rendered correctly (preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto). However, inconsistencies and errors appear: “afinado” is acceptable but less common, the abbreviation for in‑context learning is wrong, and “ancoraje” is a misspelling. Such mistakes can confuse readers familiar with the field.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of the podcast script. Cultural references are neutral and appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The few terminology glitches (e.g., AIC, ACL) slightly detract from a perfect adaptation, but the overall message remains intact.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the major points from the French original are present: pre‑entrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, la diferencia entre memoria temporal y permanente, y la explicación de la función de “Memoria”. No substantive information is omitted, though the abbreviation errors introduce minor inaccuracies.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the substance of the original podcast very well and is largely readable for Spanish‑speakers. Strengths include faithful transmission of the core concepts and a clear narrative flow. Weaknesses lie mainly in a handful of terminology mistakes (incorrect abbreviations, misspellings) and occasional unnatural phrasing that prevent it from sounding completely native. With a careful proof‑read of technical terms, the text would be excellent.\n\nOverall, the work is solid but needs minor polishing, especially regarding consistent use of established AI terminology in Spanish.\n\nScore out of 20: 15/20.\n\nRecommendation: revise the abbreviations (use ICL), correct \"ancoraje\" to \"anclaje\", and consider using \"ajuste fino\" instead of \"afinado\" for greater naturalness. After these tweaks, the translation would achieve a near‑perfect rating."
