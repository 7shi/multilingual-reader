    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but several phrasing issues reduce smooth reading. Examples: “Hola y bienvenido en” (should be “a”), mixed use of formal “Usted” and informal tones, and the awkward “se sueña con los detalles”. Minor typographical errors like “Simply utiliza” also interrupt flow.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation feels literal in many places, leading to unnatural expressions. Phrases such as “Usted ha entendido todo” after a conversational tone, “se acuerda” used inconsistently, and the literal rendering of “grounding” as “anclaje” are slightly off. Nonetheless, a native speaker can follow the dialogue.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL”. The choice of “afinado” for “fine‑tuning” is acceptable though “ajuste fino” is more common. Most English terms (prompt, ICL) are kept, which is typical in the field.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, but cultural/register adaptation is inconsistent. Switching between formal “Usted” and informal “tú” can be jarring for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Some expressions could be refined for a podcast style, e.g., using “bienvenido a” instead of “en”.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French source are present. No major sections are omitted. Minor glitches such as the stray English word “Simply” do not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning accurately, and the technical content is largely intact. However, the prose suffers from several literal translations, inconsistent register, and occasional awkward phrasing that hinder naturalness and readability. With editorial polishing—especially fixing the formal/informal mix, correcting small errors, and smoothing idiomatic expressions—the text would be much more fluid for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience.\nOverall score: 75/100 (average of the five criteria)."
