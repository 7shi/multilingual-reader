  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. Sentence structures are logical, and the flow of the conversation is preserved. However, there are a few awkward phrasings (e.g., isolated \"El preentrenamiento.\" line) and the use of the uncommon verb \"afino\" for \"fine‑tuning\" which may momentarily confuse readers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most of the script, but several expressions feel slightly off for native speakers: \"afino\" instead of \"ajuste fino\", \"ancoraje\" instead of the more common \"anclaje\", and the mix of English acronyms (AIC) within Spanish text. The incorrect acronym \"ACL\" further disrupts fluency. Overall, the text is understandable but not fully smooth.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly (preentrenamiento, transferencia, ventana de contexto). Nevertheless, the translation mishandles some key terminology: \"fine‑tuning\" is rendered as \"afino\", the standard term is \"ajuste fino\"; the acronym for In‑Context Learning is mistakenly given as \"AIC\" and later as \"ACL\"; and \"grounding\" is translated as \"ancoraje\", a less common term. Consistency suffers, lowering the score.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original podcast are well preserved. Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience, and analogies (consultor brillante, estudiar de forma apresurada) are effective. The main drawback is the inaccurate acronyms, which can mislead readers about the technical concepts. Apart from that, the adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French source are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No significant content is omitted, though the acronym errors introduce minor misinformation. The translation remains comprehensive.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original podcast’s content accurately and maintains a clear explanatory style. The main issues are inconsistent terminology (especially the use of \"afino\" and the wrong acronyms) and occasional non‑native phrasing that slightly hampers fluency. With minor adjustments to technical vocabulary and correction of the acronyms, the translation would be near‑perfect for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\nTotal score (out of 100): 71/100."
