  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are clear. Sentences are not overly long, and the podcast dialogue format is preserved, making it easy for a Spanish‑speaking listener to follow.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural. Vocabulary is appropriate and most idiomatic expressions are well chosen. A few constructions are slightly literal (e.g., \"el pre‑entrenamiento\" with a hyphen, \"bachotaje\" which is colloquial but may not be universal), but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\" and \"grounding\" are all rendered consistently. Parenthetical explanations help readers who may not know the English acronyms.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original tone to a Spanish‑language podcast audience, using greetings like \"Hola y bienvenidos\" and culturally neutral analogies. Minor issues such as the use of \"bachotaje\" could be replaced by a more universal term, but overall the intent and style are preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are present: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the notion of temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of the emerging \"Memoria\" feature. No significant information is omitted.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains readable and mostly natural, and respects the original podcast format. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but the work is solid and would be well‑understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.4/20.\n\nStrengths: faithful rendering of technical concepts, consistent terminology, clear explanations.\nWeaknesses: occasional literal phrasing and a colloquial term that may not be universally known.\nRecommendations: replace \"bachotaje\" with \"estudio intensivo\" or similar, and smooth a few hyphenated forms for a more polished read.\n\nOverall rating: 18.4/20."
