  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the flow of ideas is preserved. However, there are several grammatical slips (e.g., “se le proporcionan las informaciones”, misuse of singular‑plural agreement) and occasional awkward phrasing that can momentarily hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural but contains noticeable non‑native constructions and a few literal translations (“bachotear”, “libreta de apuntes”). The most serious flaw is the un‑translated fragment of Luc’s line that remains in French, which breaks the natural flow.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)” are correctly rendered and used consistently. The term “grounding” is left in English, but this is acceptable given its technical nature.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and adapts cultural references adequately. Nonetheless, the leftover French sentence and some literal renderings reduce cultural appropriateness, and a few expressions could be smoother for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points of the dialogue are present, but the crucial explanatory clause after Luc’s “Oui, et elle est rendue possible par …” is missing, resulting in a loss of information about the context‑window expansion. This omission lowers the completeness rating.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation captures the core message and most of the technical content, making it useful for Spanish readers. The main drawbacks are a missing segment of the original script, several grammatical inaccuracies, and a few unnatural phrasings that affect readability and fluency. With a careful edit to fix the untranslated French part and smooth out the grammar, the translation would be of high quality.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 14/20, Fluency 13/20, Terminology 16/20, Contextual Adaptation 12/20, Information Completeness 13/20. The cumulative score is 68 out of 100, indicating a good but not polished translation.\n\nDetailed reasoning for each criterion is provided in the respective fields above.\n\nRecommendation: Edit the untranslated French line, correct agreement errors, and consider more idiomatic Spanish phrasing for a more natural read.\n\n---\nThe above comment summarises the assessment and gives guidance for improvement.\n---\nThis evaluation follows the requested scoring rubric."
