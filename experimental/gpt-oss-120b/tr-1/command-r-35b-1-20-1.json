  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the original dialogue structure, so a native reader can grasp the main ideas. However, a few English fragments remain (e.g., “Thus,”) and there is an inserted JSON object that breaks the flow, forcing the reader to pause and interpret. These interruptions lower overall readability.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural constructions (e.g., \"un truco justo antes de comenzar a hablar con usted\", \"Da la impresión de que la IA recuerda…\"), occasional grammar slips, and the presence of the raw JSON snippet. These issues make the text feel stilted and not fully native‑speaker level.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally well handled: pre‑entrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, anclaje, etc. The choice of \"afinado\" for fine‑tuning is acceptable, though \"ajuste fino\" is more common. Overall the terminology is consistent and appropriate for a non‑expert audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original podcast tone and purpose, and most cultural references are suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. The leftover English words and the JSON block, however, indicate insufficient adaptation to the target language context, slightly weakening the overall impact.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the substantive information from the French script is present: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, and the description of memory‑like features. No major ideas are omitted, and the inserted JSON does not delete any content, though it adds noise.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core message of the original podcast and retains most of the technical content. Nonetheless, it is marred by several avoidable issues: residual English fragments, an accidental JSON snippet, and several awkward phrasings that hinder fluency. A careful proofread and removal of non‑linguistic artifacts would raise the quality significantly, bringing the text closer to a natural, polished Spanish podcast script."
