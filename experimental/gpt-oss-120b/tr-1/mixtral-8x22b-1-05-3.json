  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the logical flow of the original. Most sentences are clear, but there are occasional awkward constructions (e.g., “Leería una cantidad masiva de datos…”, “ACL” instead of ICL) and a few typographical errors that slightly disrupt comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, yet some phrases feel literal (“afino” for fine‑tuning, “ancoraje” instead of the more common “anclaje”). The misuse of acronyms (AIC, ACL) and occasional missing commas make the prose feel less smooth than native speech.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved (preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto). However, the choice of “afino” for fine‑tuning and the inconsistent/incorrect acronyms (AIC, ACL) reduce precision. The term “ancoraje” is non‑standard, which could confuse readers.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent, tone, and analogies (consultor brillante, examen de bachotaje). Cultural references are well adapted, but the occasional inaccurate acronym and non‑idiomatic word choices slightly weaken the adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All main ideas and examples from the French script are present. No major content is omitted. Minor issues such as the wrong acronym (ACL) and a few typographical slips do not remove information but could cause misunderstanding.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the core message of the podcast and is fairly readable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Strengths include faithful rendering of the educational analogies and maintenance of the conversational style. Weaknesses lie in inconsistent terminology (especially acronyms), occasional non‑idiomatic word choices, and minor typographical errors that affect fluency and precision. A revision focusing on standard technical vocabulary (e.g., “ajuste fino”, “anclaje”, correct use of ICL) and correcting the acronym errors would raise the quality substantially.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 70/100."
