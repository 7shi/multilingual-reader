  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. Most sentences convey the original ideas clearly, and technical concepts are explained in a straightforward manner. However, there are a few minor grammatical slips (e.g., \"¡Hola y bienvenida en\", \"conocencias\", \"las nuevas conocimientos\") that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally, but several expressions sound awkward to native speakers: \"¡Hola y bienvenida en\", \"Vea usted\", \"Se puede tomar un modelo… le presentará\", and mismatched gender/plural agreements. These issues break the natural rhythm and make the text feel a bit stilted.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Core terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje (grounding)\" and \"prompt\" are correctly translated or left in their accepted English form. Minor inconsistency between \"entrenamiento previo\" and \"preentrenamiento\" does not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural adaptation is generally appropriate, but a few phrasing choices (e.g., \"¡Hola y bienvenida en\" instead of the more idiomatic \"¡Hola y bienvenidos a\") reduce the natural fit for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Overall, the adaptation is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is retained. No significant ideas, examples, or nuances are omitted. Minor typographical errors do not result in loss of meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and keeps the technical depth intact. Readability and terminology are strong, but fluency suffers from several non‑idiomatic expressions and minor grammatical errors. Contextual adaptation is adequate, though a few phrasing adjustments would make it feel more natural to Spanish listeners. Overall, the translation is good and functional, requiring only light editing for polish.\n\nOverall Score (out of 20): 17"
