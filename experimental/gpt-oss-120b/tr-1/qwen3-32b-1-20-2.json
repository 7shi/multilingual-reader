  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas and the flow of the conversation is preserved. Minor hiccups such as occasional missing articles or slightly clunky phrasing (e.g., \"Vean ustedes mismos\" instead of \"Véanlo ustedes mismos\") do not hinder comprehension, but they slightly lower the smoothness for a native reader.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally overall, but a few constructions feel odd to a native speaker: \"cuando se abre una nueva ventana, parte de un contexto vacío\" (missing verb), \"no se afinan\" (should be \"no se afina\"), and the retention of the English term \"cheat sheet\". These small errors make the text feel a bit less polished, though the meaning remains intact.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled very well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\" → \"entrenamiento previo\", \"fine‑tuning\" → \"afinamiento\", \"transfer learning\" → \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\", etc. Consistency is kept throughout. The only notable lapse is the untranslated English phrase \"cheat sheet\", which could have been rendered as \"hoja de trucos\" or similar, but this does not seriously impair understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast tone, the analogies, and the conversational dynamics. Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is required, and the translator kept the intent intact. Minor stylistic tweaks (e.g., smoother connectors) could improve it, but the overall adaptation is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines, examples, and explanations from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No information is omitted, and no redundant content is added. The translation is faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is accurate, complete, and conveys the technical concepts clearly. It excels in terminology handling and maintains the original intent and conversational style. Small grammatical slips, occasional awkward phrasing, and the retention of an English term keep the fluency from being perfect, but overall the translation is of high quality and would be easily understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI topics."
