  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. Sentence flow is logical, and listeners can understand the discussion without difficulty. Minor issues such as occasional over‑formal phrasing (e.g., “Vea usted:”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural and conversational. There are a few awkward expressions (e.g., “¡Claro que sí!” for “Exactement!”, “El afinamento” instead of “afinamiento”) and occasional punctuation quirks, but overall it reads smoothly to a native speaker.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms like pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto and ICL are correctly rendered and consistently used. The typo “afinamento” is a small slip, and some terms could have been left in English with italics, but the terminology is generally appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish‑speaking audiences effectively, using familiar phrasing and cultural references. The name of the podcast is kept in French, which preserves branding. Overall the intent and style are well conveyed.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the structure mirrors the source closely.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is high‑quality, conveying the technical discussion clearly and naturally. Minor typographical errors and a few slightly stiff phrases prevent a perfect score, but the overall readability, terminology handling, and faithful transmission of the original message are excellent.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18.4 ≈ 18/20."
