  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original dialogue structure. Most sentences convey the intended meaning, but there are several awkward constructions (e.g., “Ved, no enseñaría…”, “¡Entiende todo.”) and occasional punctuation issues that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many literal renderings that sound unnatural to native speakers. Phrases like “¡Entiende todo.”, “La IA no ha \"olvidado\" al sentido humano” and the duplicated clause in the transfer‑learning paragraph break the natural flow. Vocabulary is mostly correct, but the overall style feels stiff.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly translated and consistently used: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste/fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje, memoria. The only minor issue is the switch between “ajuste” and “afinamiento”, but both are acceptable equivalents.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast’s conversational tone and the explanatory intent. Cultural references are not needed, and the speaker personalities remain clear. However, the unnatural phrasing mentioned above reduces the adaptation quality slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the original are present; no essential information is omitted. The duplicated sentence in the transfer‑learning segment is redundant but does not remove content. Overall the message is complete and accurate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the content and technical depth of the original French script, but it suffers from several literal and awkward renderings that affect readability and fluency. Technical terminology is well handled, and the full information is retained. A more natural, idiomatic Spanish style would raise the overall quality considerably.\n\nStrengths: correct technical terms, complete information, preservation of intent.\nWeaknesses: unnatural phrasing, occasional grammatical errors, minor redundancy.\n\nOverall the translation is functional but needs polishing to feel native‑speaker‑like.\n\nTotal score (out of 100): 82"
