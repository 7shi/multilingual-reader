  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow; sentences are generally well‑structured and the podcast‑style dialogue is preserved. Minor issues such as occasional missing commas or overly literal translations do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, but a few word choices feel slightly off for native speakers (e.g., \"afinado\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\" or \"afinamiento\", and some clunky constructions like \"El aprendizaje en contexto es estudiar de forma intensiva para un examen\"). These quirks lower the overall smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\", etc. Consistency is maintained throughout, and where the original term is jargon (e.g., \"prompt\") it is left unchanged, which is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the informal podcast tone, adapts greetings appropriately (\"¡Hola y bienvenida!\"), and keeps cultural references neutral. A few minor stylistic mismatches (use of masculine/feminine forms) do not affect the intended meaning.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the sequence of ideas is preserved. Minor typographic quirks (spacing around quotation marks) do not affect completeness.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the technical content clearly. Readability and terminology are strong points, while fluency could be polished by using more idiomatic Spanish expressions and correcting a few lexical choices. The text remains faithful to the original intent and provides a coherent listening experience for Spanish‑speaking audiences.\nScore out of 20: 18.0"
