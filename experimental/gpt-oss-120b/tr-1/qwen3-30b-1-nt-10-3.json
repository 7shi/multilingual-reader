  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are generally short and logical, and complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained with clear analogies. Minor hiccups such as occasional overly literal phrasing do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, and most expressions flow smoothly. A few constructions (e.g., \"estudiar de último momento\" instead of the more idiomatic \"de última hora\") feel slightly stiff, but overall the language is fluent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\" → \"ajuste fino\", \"transfer learning\" → \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"In‑Context Learning\" → \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\". The terminology is consistent throughout and matches the expected level for a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience, preserving the podcast tone and using suitable cultural references. Small improvements could be made (e.g., more idiomatic expressions), but the intent and purpose of the original are clearly conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and the structure mirrors the source, ensuring the listener receives the full message without loss of detail.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational style of the podcast, and is largely natural and readable in Spanish. Minor stylistic tweaks could raise fluency and cultural idiomaticity, but the work is solid and faithful to the source.\n\nStrengths: precise terminology, complete information transfer, clear explanations. Areas for improvement: occasional literal phrasing that could be replaced with more idiomatic Spanish.\n\nThe translation would be easily understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts and would serve well for a podcast script.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
