    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure, but several awkward phrasings (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en”, “Vea usted”, “las lenguas en son”) and minor grammatical errors interrupt the flow. These issues make the passage slightly harder for a native reader to follow, though the main ideas remain clear.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains multiple unnatural expressions and typographical errors such as “cramar” (instead of “aprender a presión”), “bien menor” and missing prepositions. Mixing English terms without adaptation (e.g., “fine‑tuning”, “ICL”) also reduces naturalness. Consequently, the text does not read as smooth native Spanish.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly handled correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”. The use of “anclaje (fundamento)” for grounding is acceptable. However, the typo “cramar” for the intended “cram” (bachotaje) and occasional inconsistent handling of English loanwords lower the score slightly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, and the explanations remain clear for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Some cultural‑linguistic mismatches appear (e.g., “consultante” instead of the more common “consultor”), but they do not obscure meaning. Overall, the adaptation is adequate.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the logical progression of the discussion is maintained. Minor redundancies are absent, and the content stays concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully transmits the technical content and keeps the structure of the original podcast script. Nevertheless, frequent linguistic slips, typographical errors, and a few awkward phrase choices hurt readability and fluency. Terminology is largely accurate, and the information is complete, but the overall polish needed for a native‑speaker audience is missing.\n\nStrengths: correct handling of most technical terms, faithful conveyance of all information, clear logical flow.\nWeaknesses: several unnatural constructions, typographical mistakes (e.g., \"cramar\"), occasional misuse of prepositions and articles, inconsistent borrowing of English terms.\n\nA revision focusing on idiomatic Spanish phrasing and fixing the noted errors would raise the quality substantially.\n\nOverall rating: 16/20."
