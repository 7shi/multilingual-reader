    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and the main ideas are conveyed, but there are numerous grammatical mistakes (gender agreement errors, awkward phrasing, missing prepositions) that force the reader to pause. The garbled paragraph about the \"Mémoire\" feature especially disrupts comprehension. Overall, a native reader can follow the conversation, but the flow is hindered.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound unnatural: \"bienvenido en\", \"en vía de aparecer\", \"es posiblemente gracias a\", \"sosténance\", \"bachear\", \"subes en la silla\", etc. Some literal translations (e.g., \"prompt\") are acceptable, but the accumulation of awkward constructions reduces fluency. The inclusion of an English‑style explanatory note in the middle of a dialogue is a serious break in naturalness.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"ICL\" are correctly rendered. However, \"sosténance\" is not a recognized Spanish term for \"grounding\", and the translation sometimes switches between \"competencia\", \"habilidad\" and \"conocimiento\" inconsistently. Overall the terminology is mostly correct but not perfectly adapted.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the podcast tone, but several cultural/linguistic adaptations are missing or wrong. The huge paragraph that should have been a simple question is replaced by a meta‑commentary, losing the original intent. Some idiomatic expressions are poorly adapted (e.g., \"una antelación\" instead of \"una chuleta\"). These issues affect how well the original intent is conveyed to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all content from the French script is present, but the critical line about the new \"Mémoire\" feature is not translated correctly; instead, a commentary appears. This omission and the occasional loss of nuance (e.g., \"mal compris\" turned into \"malentientende\") mean the translation is not fully complete.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the overall structure and most of the technical content, but it suffers from frequent grammatical slips, unnatural phrasing, and a serious error in one of the key sentences where the original question is replaced by an explanatory note. Terminology is mostly accurate, yet some choices are odd or inconsistent. To reach a professional level, the translator should correct gender agreements, refine idiomatic expressions, ensure every line is faithfully rendered, and eliminate the accidental insertion of meta‑comments. As it stands, the translation is partially functional but requires substantial editing before it could be used in a polished podcast script."
