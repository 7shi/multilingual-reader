  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is difficult to follow. It contains stray English words (e.g., \"where\", \"Such is the reality of ICL\"), placeholders like \"Traducción al español:\" and incomplete sentences (e.g., \"Camille: where\", \"Luc: it is\"). The flow is broken by these artifacts, making it hard for a reader to understand the dialogue.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are many unnatural constructions and literal translations (e.g., \"Y yo soy Luc\" instead of \"Yo soy Luc\", \"una cantidad masiva de datos en Internet\" sounds forced, \"memoria a corto plazo\" is okay but the surrounding phrasing is awkward). The mixture of Spanish, English and meta‑comments disrupts naturalness. Native speakers would find the text stilted.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly rendered. However, some terms are left in English (\"ICL\", \"grounding\"), and the translation sometimes adds redundant explanations (\"Traducción al español:\") that are not part of the original terminology. Consistency is moderate.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation does not adapt well to the target audience. It retains French‑style introductions, includes untranslated English fragments, and adds meta‑annotations that would never appear in a real podcast script. Cultural adaptation is minimal and the overall intent is obscured by the noise.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Important content is lost or distorted. The opening line \"Camille: where\" is meaningless, and several sentences are truncated or replaced by placeholders. While the core technical discussion is mostly present, the surrounding dialogue, humor, and flow are incomplete, leading to a loss of information.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation attempts to convey the technical discussion but is marred by numerous editorial artifacts, mixed languages, and missing or garbled dialogue. Technical terminology is mostly correct, yet readability, fluency, and completeness suffer greatly, resulting in a translation that would be confusing to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Substantial editing and a clean rewrite are required to produce a usable version.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 6/20."
