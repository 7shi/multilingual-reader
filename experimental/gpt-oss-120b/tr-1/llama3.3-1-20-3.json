  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow for a native reader. All sentences convey the original ideas, and the technical concepts are explained in a clear manner. Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing space after «Tech Éclair») do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but a few expressions are awkward: \"Ustedes han entendido todo\" is an unnatural way for a host to address the other host; a more natural phrasing would be \"Lo has entendido perfectamente\". The switch from the original abbreviation ICL to a new one AIC is also jarring. These issues prevent a completely smooth reading experience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally well‑handled: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, grounding → anclaje, etc. The main inconsistency is the change of the abbreviation ICL (In‑Context Learning) to AIC, which could confuse readers familiar with the standard term. Otherwise the terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a conversational podcast. Cultural references are neutral and appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only slight mismatch is the abbreviation change, but it does not alter the overall message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the flow of the dialogue is kept intact. Minor typographic details (spacing, punctuation) are the only omissions.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is very solid: it conveys the technical content clearly and retains the podcast’s lively style. Minor linguistic slips (an unusual plural pronoun, the unexpected abbreviation change) and tiny typographic issues keep it from being perfect, but they do not affect the overall understanding. With a few refinements the text would read as if originally written in Spanish.\nOverall score (average): 18/20."
