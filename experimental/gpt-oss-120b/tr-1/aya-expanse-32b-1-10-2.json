  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are easy to follow. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto are explained clearly. Minor hiccups (e.g., inconsistent capitalization of \"el pre‑entrenamiento\") do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but a few expressions feel foreign‑language‑influenced: the French word *antisèche* is left unchanged, and some sentences (“la expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo…”) are slightly clunky. Vocabulary is appropriate otherwise.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL*, *prompt*, *memoria* are all rendered consistently. The choice of keeping “prompt” in English is acceptable for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of the podcast script. Cultural adaptation is mostly fine, though the use of the French loanword *antisèche* could have been replaced by a Spanish equivalent (e.g., “chuleta”). Otherwise the examples and analogies work well for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No substantive information is lost. All the points made in the French version—including the distinction between aprendizaje en contexto and afinamiento, and the explanation of the “memoria” feature—are present in the Spanish version. Redundancies are minimal.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content clearly. It is mostly fluent and accurate, with only a few minor lexical choices that betray the source language. The technical terminology is consistent and the overall message of the podcast is preserved. Minor improvements could be made by replacing the French loanword *antisèche* with a Spanish equivalent and smoothing a couple of slightly awkward sentences.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20.\n\n**Strengths**: clear exposition of complex ideas, correct technical vocabulary, faithful to the original content.\n**Areas for improvement**: eliminate residual French terms, polish a few clunky phrases for a more native feel.\n\nScore: 17/20"
