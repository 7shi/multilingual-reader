  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but there are several noticeable problems: stray words (e.g., \"suelen\"), missing or cut‑off sentences (\"Cuando abre una nueva ventana\" stops abruptly), and occasional punctuation errors that interrupt the flow. Some sentences are long and cumbersome, making it harder for a reader to follow the technical narrative smoothly.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural expressions (\"Mire\", \"el afinamiento\", \"Es una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\"), and occasional English loanwords left untranslated (\"prompt\"). The mix of formal and colloquial registers is inconsistent, and the presence of editorial notes from the source (e.g., \"//Alternative…\") further damages fluency. Overall, the text feels rough rather than natural to a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje\" for grounding, etc. However, \"fine‑tuning\" is translated as \"afinamiento\", which is less common than \"ajuste fino\" and could cause slight confusion. The term \"prompt\" is left in English, which is acceptable in many AI contexts but could have been explained. Consistency is fairly good overall.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "While the core ideas are kept, the translation fails to fully adapt to the target audience: editorial comments and markup from the original translation brief appear in the final text, and some cultural‑specific phrasing is awkward (e.g., \"Mire\" as a directive). Moreover, incomplete sentences break the intended flow, reducing the effectiveness of the original podcast script.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Important information from the French original is missing or truncated. The explanation of how the context window works, the comparison between \"bacotage\" and permanent learning, and the concluding remarks are either shortened or cut off. Consequently, readers lose some nuance present in the source.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main storyline of the podcast, but it is marred by several editorial oversights, missing fragments, and unnatural language. Terminology is largely accurate, yet the presentation feels unfinished and occasionally confusing for Spanish‑speaking listeners. A thorough edit to remove stray notes, complete the cut‑off sentences, and smooth the phrasing would raise the quality significantly.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 12/20.\n\nScore: 12"
