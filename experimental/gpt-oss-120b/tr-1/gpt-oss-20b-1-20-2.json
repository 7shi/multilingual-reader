  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and the sentences flow logically. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑expert can follow. A few long sentences could be split for easier reading, but overall the comprehension level is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural to native speakers. Most vocabulary and phrasing are appropriate, but there are occasional literal renderings that feel slightly awkward (e.g., “Es por eso una memoria de uso único”, “¡Exactamente!” with extra spacing). These do not impede understanding but slightly reduce the smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled very well. Key terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and “anclaje (grounding)” are correctly translated and consistently used throughout. No important term is mistranslated or omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the podcast tone and adapts idiomatic expressions to Spanish (e.g., “una hoja de trucos” for “cheat sheet”). Cultural references are neutral, and the style remains engaging for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve impact, but the intent of the original is fully preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is retained. No sentences or ideas are lost, and the logical order is maintained. The translation adds no unnecessary redundancy and provides the same level of detail as the original.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, keeps the conversational podcast style, and is easily understandable for Spanish readers. Minor fluency hiccups prevent it from being perfect, but they are limited to a few literal phrasings.\n\nStrengths: precise terminology, faithful content transfer, good adaptation of idiomatic language.\nWeaknesses: occasional slightly stiff phrasing that could be smoother.\n\nThe translation would be well‑received by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI topics.\n\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 88/100."
