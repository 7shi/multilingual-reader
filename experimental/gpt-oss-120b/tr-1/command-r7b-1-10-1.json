    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable, but several fragments of the original French (e.g., \"Exactement.\", \"Il n'a pas besoin…\") and stray editorial notes (\"Camille: 3. **Translation Evaluation**…\") interrupt the flow. Misspellings such as \"conoscencias\" and duplicated parenthetical text also create momentary confusion. While the main ideas are conveyed, the reader must work around these anomalies, lowering the readability score.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are many unnatural constructions and punctuation issues: mixed use of \"¡Exactamente.\" and \"Exactement.\", odd phrasing like \"él transfiere sus inmensas conoscencias\" and unnecessary repetitions. The dialogue sometimes sounds like a literal word‑by‑word translation rather than natural Spanish. These flaws make the text feel stilted for a native speaker.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinación\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"enracinamiento\". Consistency is good, but a few terms are left untranslated (French \"Exactement\", \"Il n'a pas besoin…\") and the translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"afinación\" could be clarified with a short parenthetical. Overall the terminology is appropriate but not flawless.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and the educational tone of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral and suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. However, the presence of leftover French sentences and the editorial note break immersion, showing insufficient adaptation to the target audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major concepts from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. Yet, because some sentences remain in French and the note about \"Translation Evaluation\" is inserted, a small amount of information is either duplicated or obscured, resulting in a minor loss of completeness.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core content of the podcast and correctly handles most technical vocabulary, but it is marred by residual French fragments, typographical errors, and awkward phrasing. Cleaning up the stray text, fixing spelling mistakes, and smoothing the Spanish prose would markedly improve readability and fluency, bringing the overall quality up to a professional level.\n\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 63/100.\n\nRecommendations: remove the editorial note, translate every remaining French segment, correct misspellings, and revise clunky sentences for a more natural flow.\n\nScore: 63/100"
