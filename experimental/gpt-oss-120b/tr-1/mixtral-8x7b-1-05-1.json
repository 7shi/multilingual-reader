  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. Most sentences flow logically, but a few literal borrowings such as “una nueva approach” and the occasional French word left untranslated (e.g., “ancrage”) slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, yet there are several awkward phrasings and unnecessary anglicisms (\"una nueva approach\", \"una chuleta\", \"una nueva approach más flexible\"). These reduce the native‑speaker feel, though the overall meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “ventana de contexto”, “grounding”. The only inconsistency is keeping the French term “ancrage” instead of translating it to “anclaje”. Otherwise the terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the intent and tone of the original podcast script and adapts it to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor literal translations (e.g., “una nueva approach”) slightly reduce cultural naturalness, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French version are retained: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory tricks, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No important information is omitted, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original material accurately and keeps the technical depth intact. Readability and completeness are strong, but fluency suffers from occasional Anglicisms and untranslated French terms. Refining those few awkward spots would bring the translation to a near‑native level.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20.\nOverall rating: 17/20 (85/100)."
