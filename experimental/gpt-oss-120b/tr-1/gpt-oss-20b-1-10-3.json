  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow; sentences are logically ordered and concepts are clearly explained. Minor typographic quirks (e.g., extra spaces, occasional long sentences) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. A few expressions feel slightly literal or mixed registers (e.g., \"Imagínese\" vs \"tú\", \"en el prompt\"), but native speakers would understand without effort.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are correctly rendered and used consistently throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts well to Spanish‑speaking audiences. The only drawback is the inconsistent use of formal/informal address (\"usted\" vs \"tú\"), which slightly weakens the cultural adaptation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and nuances from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No relevant information is omitted or misrepresented.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, reads smoothly, and maintains the pedagogical tone of the podcast. Minor stylistic inconsistencies (register and a few literal phrases) keep it just short of perfection, but they do not affect the listener’s understanding. The work is suitable for a Spanish‑language audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nScore (out of 100): 91"
