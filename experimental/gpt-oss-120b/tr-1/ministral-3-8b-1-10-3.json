  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is difficult to follow. It mixes Spanish, English, and French fragments (e.g., “previous”, “You”, “grounding”, “memory”). Meta‑comments such as “**Traducción al español:**” interrupt the flow, and many sentences are cut off. A reader would have to constantly guess missing words, so comprehension is low.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Natural Spanish is lacking. There are literal translations, awkward constructions (“El modelo en sí no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus conversaciones”) mixed with English terminology left untranslated. The insertion of English words and the inconsistent use of punctuation make the text sound stilted.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are inconsistently handled. Some are left in English (e.g., “fine‑tuning”, “in‑context learning”, “grounding”), others are partially translated, and a few are explained with unnecessary meta‑comments. This creates confusion for a reader familiar with AI terminology in Spanish.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation does not adapt the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are untouched, and the original conversational tone is lost amid the mixed‑language placeholders. The purpose of the podcast script is obscured.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several portions of the original dialogue are missing or replaced by placeholders like “previous” and “You”. Important explanatory sentences are omitted, and the added meta‑comments do not compensate for the lost information.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of poor quality. It mixes languages, contains many untranslated fragments and meta‑annotations, and fails to deliver a coherent, natural Spanish version of the original podcast script. Technical concepts are only partially rendered, and essential information is lost, making the text hard to read and understand for the target audience.\n\nA substantial revision is needed: remove English placeholders, translate all dialogue fully into fluent Spanish, keep technical terms consistent (preferably in their established Spanish forms or with clear glossaries), and preserve the original conversational tone.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 5/20."
