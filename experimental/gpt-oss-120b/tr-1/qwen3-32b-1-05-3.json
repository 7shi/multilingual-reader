  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. Sentence structures are logical and most of the dialogue flows naturally. Minor issues such as inconsistent use of formal/informal pronouns (\"Usted\" vs \"tú\") and a few slightly clunky phrases slightly reduce smoothness, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward expressions: \"Usted lo entendió todo\" is unusually formal for a podcast, \"antisèche\" is left in French (a Spanish speaker would expect \"chuleta\" or \"resumen\"), and \"ancoraje\" is a less common word for \"grounding\". These quirks prevent a fully native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\" are correctly rendered. The only questionable choice is \"ancoraje\" for \"grounding\"; \"anclaje\" or \"enraizamiento\" would be more standard. Overall consistency is good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and purpose. Cultural adaptation is adequate, though the retention of the French word \"antisèche\" and the occasional shift between formal and informal registers show a slight mismatch with typical Spanish podcast style. Otherwise the content is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present. No significant ideas are omitted, and the logical order of the dialogue is kept. Minor stylistic additions (e.g., explanations of terms) are not needed, so the translation remains concise while complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. Readability and completeness are strong, but fluency suffers from a few unnatural lexical choices and inconsistent register. Terminology is mostly spot‑on, with only one term that could be improved. With minor polishing (especially regarding \"grounding\" and the French loanword \"antisèche\"), the translation would feel completely natural to native Spanish listeners.\nOverall score reflects the average of the five criteria, yielding a respectable 16/20."
