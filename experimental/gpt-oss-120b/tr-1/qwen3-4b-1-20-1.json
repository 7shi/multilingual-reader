  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the logical flow of the conversation is kept. However, there are several grammatical slips (e.g., \"bienvenido en\" instead of \"bienvenido a\", missing accents, inconsistent use of \"tú\"/\"usted\") and some awkward phrasing that can momentarily confuse the reader. These issues lower the ease of comprehension.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many non‑native constructions: \"el aprendizaje en contexto, es del aplastar\", \"Usted ha entendido todo\", \"groundity\", and mixed formal/informal registers. These make the text sound stilted rather than smooth. Vocabulary is mostly correct, but the overall naturalness is compromised.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"transfer learning\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\" are correctly kept. The term \"grounding\" is mistranslated as \"groundity\" and the informal expression for \"cramming\" is rendered as \"aplastar\", which is inaccurate. Despite these few errors, the terminology is largely appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and the podcast‑style dialogue, and it keeps the brand name \"Tech Éclair\" unchanged, which is appropriate. Nevertheless, the mix of formal \"usted\" and informal \"tú\", as well as literal translations of some idioms, make the adaptation feel less polished for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the concepts, examples, and explanations from the French original are present in the Spanish version. No major idea is omitted, and the structure of the conversation is maintained. Minor wording errors do not lead to loss of information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in transmitting the full content and most technical ideas of the original podcast. However, it suffers from several grammatical and idiomatic mistakes that affect readability and naturalness. Terminology is largely correct, though a few key terms are mistranslated. A careful proofreading and adjustment of register would bring the text to a higher quality level.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 70/100."
