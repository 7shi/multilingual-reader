    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory) are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can understand. Minor issues such as occasional redundant phrasing and a slightly awkward transition when introducing the “memoria” feature do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few expressions feel forced or literal. Examples include “Aprendizaje por Computadora” (should be “Aprendizaje en Contexto”), mixed use of “ajuste fino” and “afinamiento”, and the phrase “su área de trabajo temporal simplemente ha sido vaciada”. These quirks make the text sound like a literal translation rather than native prose.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, grounding → anclaje, etc. However, inconsistency in the translation of fine‑tuning and the erroneous “Aprendizaje por Computadora” reduce precision. Overall the terminology is appropriate for the target audience but not perfectly consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of the podcast. The opening greeting (“Buenos días”) fits Spanish‑speaking listeners, and cultural references are minimal, so no major adaptation is needed. The only questionable adaptation is the change of the podcast’s name from “Tech Éclair” to “Tech Claridad”, which is unnecessary and slightly alters brand identity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present. No key point is omitted, and the examples (English‑to‑French transfer, consultant analogy, memory feature) are kept. The only loss is the slight nuance introduced by the wrong term “Aprendizaje por Computadora”, which could cause mild confusion, but the factual content remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and is largely understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. It succeeds in keeping the conversational style of a podcast while explaining sophisticated AI concepts. Nevertheless, a few lexical slips (incorrect term for ICL, inconsistent fine‑tuning wording) and a somewhat literal tone in places prevent it from being completely natural. Minor edits—especially standardising terminology and fixing the ICL translation—would raise the quality significantly.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 79\n\nThe translation is solid and usable, but it would benefit from a careful proof‑read by a native speaker familiar with AI jargon to smooth out the remaining rough edges."
