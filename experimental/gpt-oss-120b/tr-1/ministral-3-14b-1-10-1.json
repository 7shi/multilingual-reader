  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are short and the dialogue format is preserved, making the content accessible. A few minor issues reduce flow, such as the inserted “Traducción al español (versión final):” line inside the conversation, which breaks the narrative rhythm, and occasional overly literal translations that feel a bit clunky.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native speaker overall. Vocabulary is appropriate and colloquial expressions like “empollarse” fit the informal podcast tone. Some phrasing feels slightly forced (e.g., “Podríamos decir eso” after discussing a “truco”, and the parenthetical note about the translation). These quirks prevent a perfect fluency rating.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and “grounding” are correctly translated or kept in the original with clear explanations. Consistency is maintained throughout the text, and the occasional use of the English acronym in parentheses helps comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French content to a Spanish‑speaking audience, preserving the podcast’s informal style. The use of region‑specific slang (“empollarse”) works for many Spanish readers, though it may feel too Spain‑centric for a broader audience. The unnecessary “Traducción al español (versión final)” tag is out of place and reflects a literal carry‑over from the translation process rather than a contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the substantive information from the French script is retained: explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory tricks, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. No major ideas are omitted, and the added explanatory notes do not alter the original meaning. The only minor redundancy is the explicit translation note, which does not affect content completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and with a tone that suits a Spanish‑language audience. Technical concepts are clearly rendered, and the dialogue remains engaging. Minor hiccups—especially the inserted translation label and a few slightly stilted sentences—prevent it from being flawless, but the piece is highly understandable and faithful to the source.\n\n**Total score:** 86/100 (average of the five criteria)."
