  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to follow. Sentences are logical and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can grasp. Minor typographical errors such as duplicated speaker labels (\"Camille: Camille:\" and \"Luc: Luc:\") slightly disrupt the flow, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., \"Lo han entendido todo\" instead of \"Lo has entendido todo\", \"chuleta\" which is very colloquial, and occasional literal renderings like \"ventana de contexto\"). These issues prevent it from being completely smooth for native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, ventana de contexto, grounding → anclaje, etc. The terminology is consistent throughout and appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and adapts cultural references reasonably. Some expressions remain overly literal from French, and the use of \"chuleta\" may feel regional, but overall the content is appropriate for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present. No significant ideas are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary material. Minor duplication errors do not affect the informational content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transferring the technical discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning into Spanish. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency suffers from a handful of awkward phrasings and minor typographical glitches. Cultural adaptation is adequate, though some colloquial choices could be refined. Overall, it is a good translation that would be well understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience, but it could benefit from a light edit to polish the language and fix the duplicate speaker tags.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
