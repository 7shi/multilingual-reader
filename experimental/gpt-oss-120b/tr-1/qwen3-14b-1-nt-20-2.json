  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas, and complex concepts are explained in a straightforward way. Minor issues such as occasional overly long sentences and a few punctuation quirks do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, but there are several awkward phrasings (e.g., “el afinado”, “una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automático”, inconsistent use of English words like “prompt”). These moments make the text feel slightly stilted to a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly. “preentrenamiento”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL”, “grounding” and “prompt” are retained or translated appropriately. The choice of “afinado” for “fine‑tuning” is understandable, though “ajuste fino” would be more common. Overall the terminology is consistent and suitable for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast’s informal, conversational tone and adapts cultural references (e.g., greeting style). Minor gendered wording (“¡Hola y bienvenida!”) slightly shifts the original neutral greeting, but it does not affect the overall intent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the translation does not add irrelevant material.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the original content accurately. Readability and terminology are strong, and the technical ideas are well preserved. Fluency could be improved by smoothing a few awkward expressions and using more idiomatic Spanish equivalents for certain terms. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners of the podcast."
