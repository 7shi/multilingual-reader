  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure, but there are several awkward phrasings and grammatical slips (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en…”, “Usted afinan un modelo”, “las conocencias”). These require a reread for full comprehension, lowering the score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds stilted in many places. The mix of formal \"Usted\" and informal \"tú\" pronouns, literal translations like “del bachotage”, and errors such as “conversión” instead of “conversación” make the language feel unnatural to native speakers.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly – preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning (afinado), ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding (anclaje) are all appropriate. However, occasional misuse of words (e.g., “conocencias” for \"knowledge\") and inconsistent treatment of English loanwords slightly detract.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and maintains the podcast tone, but the shift to a more formal register and some literal renderings do not fully match the casual, conversational style expected by Spanish‑speaking podcast listeners.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are present; no substantive information is omitted. Minor lexical errors do not affect the factual content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in transmitting the full content and technical ideas, but it suffers from several linguistic inaccuracies, inconsistent register, and occasional mistranslations that affect readability and naturalness. A revision focusing on consistent pronoun use, correcting grammatical errors, and choosing more idiomatic Spanish would raise the overall quality substantially.\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 74/100."
