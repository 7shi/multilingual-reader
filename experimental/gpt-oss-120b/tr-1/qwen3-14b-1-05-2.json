  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, etc.) are explained clearly. Minor punctuation quirks do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Most expressions are idiomatic, but a few phrases are literal translations from French (e.g., \"el modelo mismo no aprende\" and \"se acuerda\" instead of the more common \"recuerda\"). These do not break the flow but are slightly less smooth.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". The glossary‑style parenthesis for English terms is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are neutral and the analogy of a consultant versus a permanent expert is well adapted (\"consultor temporal\"/\"consultor permanente\").",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical concepts accurately, reads clearly, and feels natural for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor literal renderings prevent a perfect fluency score, but they do not affect the overall effectiveness of the podcast script.\n\nStrengths: precise terminology, faithful content transfer, clear explanations. Areas for improvement: smooth out a few literal phrases to make them sound more idiomatic.\n\nScore: 19/20 (average of the five criteria)."
