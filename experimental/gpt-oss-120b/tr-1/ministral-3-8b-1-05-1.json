    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version mixes several languages (French, English, and even raw markup) and contains many unfinished sentences (e.g., “Luc: Pre‑training”, “Camille: we”, “Luc: It is”). These interruptions break the flow and force the reader to guess the missing parts. The structure of the dialogue is therefore hard to follow, especially for a reader who only knows Spanish.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "When the text is in Spanish, many sentences are literal translations that sound unnatural (e.g., “el modelo experto en inglés” instead of “un modelo entrenado en inglés”). There are also obvious placeholders such as “She forgets everything.” left in English, and the use of brackets and asterisks is atypical for spoken‑podcast style. Overall the translation does not read as a smooth, natural conversation.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto) are correctly rendered, which is a strength. However, the handling is inconsistent: sometimes the English term is kept (e.g., “ICL (In‑Context Learning)”), sometimes it is omitted, and occasional French terms remain (e.g., “ancrage”, “fenêtre de contexte”). The mixed usage can confuse readers unfamiliar with the bilingual jargon.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent—to explain AI learning methods in a podcast format—is partially preserved, but the translation fails to adapt culturally or stylistically to a Spanish‑speaking audience. The inclusion of raw editorial notes (e.g., “**Traducción al español:**”) and the preservation of English sentences break the immersion and do not respect the target audience’s expectations for a seamless podcast script.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is present in a rough form, but several crucial passages are missing or corrupted (e.g., the discussion about “anchoring”, the analogy about a consultant, and the concluding remarks). Additionally, the translation adds irrelevant markup and omits some explanatory clauses, reducing clarity while keeping the overall length similar.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the overall outline of the podcast but is riddled with incomplete sentences, language mixing, and formatting artifacts that severely hinder readability and naturalness. While technical terminology is mostly correct, the inconsistent handling of English terms and the presence of untranslated fragments make the text feel unfinished. A thorough revision is needed: translate every line fully into Spanish, remove editorial markup, ensure fluent conversational style, and keep terminology consistent throughout.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 7/20."
