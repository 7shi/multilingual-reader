    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and conveys the podcast dialogue clearly. Most sentences follow a logical order and the concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can follow. However, there are a few awkward phrasings (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenido en\", \"Entrenamiento previo\") and a typo that slightly disrupts smooth reading.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in many places, but several expressions are unidiomatic or contain errors: \"Hola y bienvenido en\" should be \"Hola y bienvenido a\", \"es cramar\" is a nonsense word, and the mixture of \"preentrenamiento\"/\"preentrenamiento\" is inconsistent. These issues make the text feel less fluid to a native speaker.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally well‑handled. \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\" (acceptable alternative to \"ajuste fino\"), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" and \"anclaje\" are correctly translated and used consistently. Minor inconsistencies (e.g., occasional use of \"pre‑entrenamiento\") do not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast tone and adapts it to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are minimal, so no major adaptation is required. The few unnatural phrases slightly reduce the adaptation quality, but overall the intent and purpose are maintained.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the major points from the original French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted, and the structure mirrors the source. The typo \"cramar\" loses the nuance of \"cramming\", but the overall message remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of conveying the technical discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning. Terminology is mostly accurate and the content is complete. Nevertheless, the text suffers from a few unidiomatic expressions and a clear typo that affect readability and fluency. With a light post‑editing pass to correct these issues, the translation would be near‑native quality.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 16/20.\n\nScore: 16"
