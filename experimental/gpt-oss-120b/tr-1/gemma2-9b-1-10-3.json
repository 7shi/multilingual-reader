    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the flow of ideas mirrors the original French. Most sentences are clear, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in understandable terms. However, there are occasional grammatical slips (e.g., \"aprende los palabras\") and a French fragment left in the middle of a sentence, which slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few expressions feel awkward or literal. Examples include the mixed‑language segment \"Voyez plutôt : no enseñarías...\", the use of \"el afinado\" instead of the more common \"el afinamiento\" or \"el ajuste fino\", and occasional redundancy. These issues prevent the text from reaching native‑speaker fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\" are all appropriate. The only notable inconsistency is the use of \"afianzamiento\" for \"fine‑tuning\", which is not the standard term in Spanish AI literature. The word \"prompt\" is left untranslated, which is acceptable in technical contexts.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are neutral and fit a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor lapses (the French phrase left untranslated, occasional literal renderings) slightly reduce the adaptation quality but do not change the overall message.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning, the analogy of temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No essential information is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the technical content accurately and is fairly readable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The main weaknesses are occasional linguistic slips, a leftover French fragment, and inconsistent terminology for fine‑tuning. With minor edits to polish the language and ensure consistent technical vocabulary, the translation would reach a high professional standard.\n\n**Total score:** 83/100 (average of the five criteria). The translation is solid but could benefit from a thorough proofreading pass to correct the few grammatical and lexical issues identified.\n\n**Strengths:** correct handling of most technical terms, complete transfer of information, clear explanatory style.\n**Areas for improvement:** eliminate mixed‑language remnants, standardize terminology (e.g., \"ajuste fino\"), and smooth out minor grammatical errors for native‑speaker fluency."
