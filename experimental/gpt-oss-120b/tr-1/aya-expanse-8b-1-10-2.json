  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and the ideas flow logically. Sentences are generally well‑structured, making the technical discussion easy to follow for a non‑specialist audience. Minor long sentences exist but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, but there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., \"realmente comienzan a recordar\", \"ha sido vaciada\"). Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic in most places, with only occasional stilted phrasing.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, anclaje, etc. The terminology is consistent throughout and matches the expected Spanish usage in AI literature.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural adaptation is minimal and mostly appropriate. The only notable slip is the change of the podcast name from \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Tech Destello\" at the very end, which deviates from the source.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All substantive information from the French script is present. No major facts are omitted, and the added explanatory clause about transfer learning does not alter meaning. The small naming inconsistency does not affect the factual content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid. It conveys the technical concepts accurately and reads well for Spanish‑speaking listeners, with only minor fluency glitches and a small inconsistency in the podcast title. The handling of terminology and completeness is strong, making the text suitable for its intended audience.\n\nStrengths: correct technical vocabulary, clear explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning. Weaknesses: occasional awkward phrasing and the final name change.\n\nThe translation would benefit from a quick proofread to smooth the few stilted sentences and to keep the podcast name consistent throughout.\n\nScore out of 20: 17"
