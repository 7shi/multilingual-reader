  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand. The ideas are presented in a logical order and the explanations of concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia y aprendizaje en contexto are clear. A few punctuation issues (exclamation marks left open, mixing «¡» with periods) and occasional overly long sentences slightly hinder smooth reading, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward phrasings and minor typographical errors: “muy real”, “el afinar” (instead of “el afinamiento”), “Trasfiere”, “anchora” for “grounding”, and the use of Portuguese spelling “informações”. These hiccups make the prose feel a bit stilted for a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely preserved (preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto). However, the noun form for fine‑tuning is inconsistently rendered as “afinar” rather than “afinamiento”, and “grounding” is translated as “anchora”, a non‑standard term; the more usual “anclaje” would be expected. This reduces terminological consistency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone of a podcast conversation, using equivalents like “consultor brillante”. Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor literal renderings (e.g., “caja de trabajo temporal”) feel slightly odd, but the overall message is conveyed accurately.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the flow of the dialogue is maintained. Small typographical slips (e.g., “informações”) do not remove any essential information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content and conversational style of the original podcast. It is comprehensible and mostly faithful, but it suffers from occasional grammatical slips, non‑standard terminology, and punctuation errors that affect fluency and polish. A careful proofread and a few terminology adjustments would raise the quality to a near‑native level.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
