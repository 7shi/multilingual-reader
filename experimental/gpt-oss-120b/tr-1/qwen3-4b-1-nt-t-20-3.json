  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the flow of ideas follows the original script. However, there are several interruptions to smooth reading: the verb \"despearar\" is a misspelling, the French phrase \"C'est logique.\" is left untranslated, and the translation alternates between \"preentrenamiento\" and \"Entrenamiento previo\" which can confuse the reader. Minor typographical errors (e.g., \"incrediblement flexible\") also break the rhythm. These issues lower the overall readability despite the content being mostly clear.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound unnatural to a native Spanish speaker. Examples include \"despearar el velo\", the mixture of French and Spanish in the same sentence, and the retention of English terms like \"prompt\" without explanation. Some constructions are literal translations that feel stiff (e.g., \"la IA no ha 'olvidado' en el sentido humano\"). The text would benefit from smoother phrasing and consistent terminology, which is why the fluency score is modest.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\". The translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"afinamiento\" is acceptable, though sometimes \"afinado\" appears. The word \"grounding\" is rendered as \"anclaje\", which is a reasonable equivalent. The term \"prompt\" is left in English, which is common in the field but could have been glossed. Overall terminology is accurate but not perfectly consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and the pedagogical tone of the podcast. Cultural references are appropriate for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Nonetheless, the presence of untranslated French fragments and occasional awkward phrasing reduces the adaptation quality. A few expressions could be better localized (e.g., \"consultor brillante\" works, but \"despearar el velo\" does not).",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the main ideas, examples, and analogies from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is omitted, and the logical sequence of the discussion is kept intact. Minor redundancies or inconsistencies do not affect the completeness of the conveyed information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and retains the educational spirit of the original podcast. Strengths include correct handling of most technical terms and preservation of the logical structure. Weaknesses lie in occasional spelling errors, untranslated French fragments, and unnatural phrasing that affect readability and fluency. With a careful proofread and more consistent terminology, the translation would reach a higher quality level.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
