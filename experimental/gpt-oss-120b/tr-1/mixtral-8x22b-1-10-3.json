  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas, and complex concepts are explained with suitable examples. A few minor issues (e.g., the retained French interjection \"D'accord.\", slightly awkward phrasing \"Olvídalo todo\") do not impede comprehension but slightly affect smooth reading.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are occasional unnatural expressions: \"el afinamiento\" is less common than \"fine‑tuning\" or \"ajuste fino\", \"vinculación de respuestas\" is a literal translation of \"grounding\" that feels odd, and \"Olvídalo todo\" is colloquial in a way that doesn't match the formal tone. Overall, a native speaker would understand it without effort, but the flow could be improved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\" are appropriate. The translation of \"grounding\" as \"vinculación de respuestas\" is not the usual term (\"anclaje\" or \"grounding\" is often kept). \"Fine‑tuning\" rendered as \"afinamiento\" is acceptable but less standard. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation preserves the podcast tone and cultural neutrality. The title is adapted to \"TecnoClaridad\" and the conversational style is kept. The only lapse is the untranslated French phrase \"D'accord.\" which breaks the Spanish flow. Otherwise, the translation respects the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present. No ideas or examples are lost, and the structure mirrors the source. Minor stylistic omissions (the French interjection) do not affect factual completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the original content accurately. Readability and completeness are strong, while fluency and terminology could be polished a bit, especially by using more idiomatic Spanish technical terms and eliminating the stray French phrase. The translation would be well‑understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners of a tech podcast, but a final editorial pass could raise its naturalness to a near‑native level.\n\n**Total score (average of the five criteria): 16.4 / 20**\n**Rounded overall rating:** 16 / 20.\n\n**Strengths:** clear explanation of concepts, faithful rendering of the dialogue, good cultural adaptation.\n**Areas for improvement:** replace \"afinamiento\" with a more common term (e.g., \"ajuste fino\"), translate or adapt \"grounding\" appropriately, remove leftover French interjections, and smooth some colloquial phrasing.\n\n**Recommendation:** A light post‑editing by a native speaker familiar with AI terminology would bring the translation to an excellent level."
