  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to follow. Sentences are logical and the concepts are explained clearly. A few long sentences and the occasional heavy use of parentheses make it slightly harder to read, but overall a Spanish‑speaking listener can understand the podcast script without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, using idiomatic expressions like “empollarse”. However, some literal renderings (e.g., “afinado”, the inserted note about «sujeto implícito», and occasional clunky phrasing) feel a bit unnatural to a native ear.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well‑handled: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding, etc. The main drawback is the use of “afinado” instead of the standard “ajuste fino”, which may confuse readers. Consistency is otherwise good.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content for a Spanish‑language audience, using familiar analogies (“empollarse”, “chuleta”). The inserted editorial comment about “sujeto implícito” breaks the flow and is out of place, slightly reducing cultural and contextual suitability.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present. No key points are omitted, and the added clarifications (e.g., about the term ‘afinage’) are helpful rather than harmful. The only minor issue is some redundancy from the extra notes.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and is understandable for Spanish listeners. It is fluent and complete, though a few terminology choices (especially “afinado”) and the presence of editorial side‑notes detract from perfect naturalness. Minor edits would bring it to a near‑native level.\n\nStrengths: clear exposition of complex AI concepts, good use of idiomatic Spanish, thorough coverage of the source material.\nWeaknesses: occasional unnatural phrasing, non‑standard technical term choice, and intrusive explanatory notes that interrupt the dialogue flow.\n\nWith slight polishing, the translation would be excellent for a podcast audience.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 15/20."
