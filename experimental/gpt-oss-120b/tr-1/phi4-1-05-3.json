    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but the inclusion of an English meta‑commentary line (\"Luc: . In this structure, 'l'étape suivante'…\") breaks the flow. Inconsistent use of \"afinado\" vs. \"afinamiento\" also forces the reader to pause. Overall, the sentence structures are logical, but the noise reduces ease of reading.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural, but there are occasional awkward constructions (e.g., \"El aprendizaje en contexto es como hacer repaso para un examen\", \"El modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de vuestras discusiones\"). The mix of formal and slightly informal registers is acceptable for a podcast, yet the stray English passage detracts from fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"memoria a corto plazo\" and the parenthetical English equivalents are well handled. Minor inconsistency between \"afinado\" and \"afinamiento\" could confuse readers, but overall the terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and adapts cultural references correctly. However, the presence of the English explanatory note (which belongs to a translation guide, not the podcast) is out of place for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The occasional literal translations (“consultor brillante”) are acceptable, but the extraneous content reduces contextual suitability.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All substantive information from the French script is retained; no major ideas are omitted. The only issue is the addition of non‑original English commentary, which adds noise rather than omitting content. Hence completeness is high but not perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the core concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning quite well, and most technical terminology is correctly rendered. The main weaknesses are the accidental inclusion of an English meta‑commentary line and some inconsistency in the rendering of \"fine‑tuning\" (\"afinado\" vs. \"afinamiento\"). A cleanup to remove non‑dialogue material and to standardise terminology would make the text much more readable and natural for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience."
