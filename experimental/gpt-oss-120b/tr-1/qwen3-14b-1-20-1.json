  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the logical flow of the original dialogue. Sentences are generally short and the concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained with clear analogías. A few Spanish speakers might stumble on the word “bacar” (used for “cramming”), which is not a standard term, but the surrounding context makes the meaning clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the text reads naturally, but there are a handful of awkward or non‑idiomatic choices: “bacar” instead of “empollar”, retaining the French word “antisèche” instead of using the Spanish “chuleta”, and the use of “afinamiento” where “ajuste fino” or simply “fine‑tuning” would be more common. These minor issues prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well. “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto” and “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)” are all appropriate and consistently used. The translator sometimes kept French loanwords (e.g., “antisèche”) instead of providing a Spanish equivalent, but this does not severely hinder understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation successfully adapts the podcast tone to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are minimal, and the analogies (consultant, bicycle, etc.) work in Spanish. Minor lapses (the retained French term) slightly reduce the cultural fit, but overall the intent and purpose are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present. No significant content has been omitted or added unnecessarily. The only minor redundancy is the occasional repetition of explanations that already existed in the original, but this does not affect completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, conveying the technical discussion clearly and keeping the conversational style of the podcast. A few lexical choices (\"bacar\", \"antisèche\") are non‑standard in Spanish, which slightly affects fluency and cultural adaptation, but they do not obscure meaning. Technical terminology is accurate and consistent, and the content is complete.\nOverall score: 88/100.\nRecommendations: replace non‑idiomatic words with standard Spanish equivalents (e.g., \"empollar\" for \"bacar\", \"chuleta\" for \"antisèche\"), and consider using \"ajuste fino\" instead of \"afinamiento\" for finer naturalness.\n\n---\n**Scoring summary**\n- Readability: 18/20\n- Fluency: 17/20\n- Terminology: 18/20\n- Contextual adaptation: 17/20\n- Information completeness: 18/20\n- **Total**: 88/100"
