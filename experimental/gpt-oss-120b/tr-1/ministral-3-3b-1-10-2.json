  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is riddled with incomplete sentences, leftover English fragments, and editorial notes (e.g., \"(the next step was…)\", \"**Justification for final translation choices**\"). Many lines are unintelligible or abruptly cut, making it very hard for a Spanish‑speaking reader to follow the discussion. The logical flow of the podcast dialogue is frequently broken.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Numerous unnatural constructions appear: \"He ya oído este término\", \"Los nuevas conocimientos\", \"es una forma astuciosa\" inserted in a Spanish context, as well as direct borrowings of French or English words without adaptation. Verb tenses and agreements are often wrong, and the text mixes registers (technical, informal, meta‑commentary) in a way a native speaker would never produce.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Some key technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto) are correctly rendered, but many are either omitted, mistranslated, or left in French/English. Inconsistent use of \"afinado\" vs. \"afinación\", and occasional wrong gender/plural agreements undermine terminological consistency.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent—to explain pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning—is largely lost due to the broken sentences and insertion of translation‑process notes. Cultural references are not adapted, and the explanatory analogies (e.g., consultant, bike‑riding) become confusing because of the fragmented rendering.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Important portions of the dialogue are missing or severely truncated (e.g., Luc’s explanations about memory features, the concluding remarks). The translation also adds irrelevant meta‑commentary that does not belong to the original podcast script. Consequently, the content is incomplete and partially inaccurate.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is far from publishable. It contains numerous unfinished fragments, editorial annotations, and misplaced meta‑comments that break readability and fluency. While a few technical terms are correctly translated, the overall rendering fails to convey the original podcast’s clear, instructional tone. A complete re‑translation, removing all editorial notes and ensuring consistent terminology and smooth Spanish prose, is required.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 4.2 → rounded to 4 out of 20.\n\n**Overall score**: 4\n"
