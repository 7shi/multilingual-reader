  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are short and the flow of ideas mirrors the original, making the concepts clear for a non‑technical audience. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., “las nuevas conocimientos”) slightly hinder smooth reading but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward choices: the switch to formal \"Usted\" in \"Usted lo entendió todo\" while the rest of the dialogue is informal, the use of \"ancoraje\" instead of the more common \"anclaje\", and the retention of the French word \"antisèche\". These issues make the text feel slightly stilted for native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\" and \"grounding\" are correctly rendered and consistently used. The only minor inconsistency is the occasional hyphenation (\"pre‑entrenamiento\" vs \"preentrenamiento\").",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original intent well and respects the podcast format. Cultural adaptation is mostly good, but the French term \"antisèche\" is left untranslated, and \"ancoraje\" is a less common translation for \"grounding\". These small lapses prevent a perfect adaptation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is preserved. Minor language errors do not result in loss of content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. It is readable and largely fluent, with correct handling of most terminology. A few grammatical inaccuracies, inconsistent formality, and the retention of a French loanword prevent it from reaching the highest level of naturalness. With minor polishing, especially around gender agreement, formal vs informal pronouns, and cultural lexical choices, the translation would be excellent.\nScore: 85/100"
