  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original script. Most sentences are easy to understand, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in plain language. A few parenthetical notes (e.g., “Traducción al español (versión final)”) interrupt the reading but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are occasional awkward phrasing and literal renderings that feel stilted for native speakers (e.g., “¡Lo ha entendido todo!”, “le habíamos proporcionado simplemente una pista oculta”). Some English terms like “prompt” are left untranslated, which breaks the flow. Overall it is understandable but not fully idiomatic.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento* (fine‑tuning), *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto* (ICL) and *grounding* are either translated correctly or given both the Spanish and original English forms. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using appropriate equivalents and preserving the podcast‑style tone. Minor cultural mismatches remain (some French‑style exclamations are kept), but the overall intent and persuasive style are retained.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present. No major ideas are omitted, and the added parenthetical notes do not remove content. The explanation of “Memoria” features is fully retained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the original technical discussion effectively. Readability and completeness are strong, and terminology is precise. Fluency could be improved by smoothing out a few literal translations and removing unnecessary meta‑comments. With minor stylistic polishing, the text would read like a native‑speaker podcast script.\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 87/100."
