  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall understandable and the flow of ideas is clear. However, there are several typographical errors (e.g., “Trasfiere”, “donc”), occasional awkward phrasing and a mixture of French words that slightly impede smooth reading. The core concepts are conveyed, but a native reader would need to reread a few sentences.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural but contains a few unidiomatic expressions (“¡Claro que sí!” instead of a more neutral “Exactamente”, “es una memoria de un solo uso” without a comma, etc.) and several spelling/grammar mistakes that break the natural rhythm. These issues prevent the text from feeling fully fluent.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto” and “ICL” are correctly rendered and used consistently. The choice of “enraizado” for “grounding” is acceptable, though “anclaje” might be more common. Overall the terminology is handled well.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and adapts most expressions for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor issues remain: the podcast name is inconsistently translated (“Tecno Brillo” vs “Tech Éclair” at the end) and a few French remnants persist, which reduces cultural consistency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present, and no significant information is omitted. The only notable lapse is the untranslated podcast title at the very end, which is a small but visible oversight.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content and overall narrative. It is mostly clear and uses appropriate terminology, but it is marred by typographical errors, occasional unidiomatic phrasing, and a few inconsistencies (e.g., mixed use of the podcast name). With a careful proofread and slight stylistic adjustments, the text would reach a higher level of polish.\nOverall score (out of 20): 15"
