  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the explanations of complex concepts are clear. Sentence flow is logical, but occasional French fragments (e.g., \"C'est là qu'intervient le concept de…\") interrupt comprehension, slightly lowering the score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most parts, using appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic expressions. However, there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., \"El afianzamiento\", \"Oui.\") and the presence of untranslated French words make parts feel stilted.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), grounding, etc. The only inconsistency is the use of \"afianzamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\" and occasional mixing of languages, but the core terminology remains accurate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue, adapting it well for Spanish‑speaking listeners. The main drawback is the residual French phrases, which feel out of place culturally and disrupt the seamless adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and analogies from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No relevant information is omitted, and the content remains faithful to the original.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. It would benefit from a final proofread to eliminate the stray French fragments and to unify terminology (preferably using \"ajuste fino\" throughout). Once those minor issues are fixed, the text would read as a smooth, native‑speaker podcast script.\n\nScore (out of 100): 83"
