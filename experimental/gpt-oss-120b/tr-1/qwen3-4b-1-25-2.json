    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the structure of the original dialogue. However, there are inconsistencies (e.g., “entrenamiento previo” vs. “preentrenamiento”) and a few awkward phrases such as “aplastar para un examen” which do not convey the intended meaning of “cramming”. These issues slightly hinder smooth comprehension for a native reader.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural to a native speaker: “el afinamiento” is rarely used for fine‑tuning, “El aprendizaje en contexto, es del aplastar” is grammatically incorrect, and “anticipe” is a misspelling of “antisècha”. The overall flow is acceptable but the awkwardness reduces fluency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled well. Key concepts such as “fine‑tuning”, “transfer learning”, “In‑Context Learning (ICL)”, “ventana de contexto” and “anclaje” are correctly translated and consistent. The only minor drawback is the choice of “el afinamiento” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”, but it remains understandable.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and explanatory tone, making the podcast format clear. Some literal translations (e.g., “aplastar” for “cramming”) feel out of place culturally, but they do not distort the message. Overall the adaptation is adequate.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the dialogue order is maintained. Minor redundancies exist but do not affect completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content and conversational style of the original podcast fairly well. While the terminology is accurate and the information complete, readability and fluency suffer from several awkward word choices and inconsistencies. A revision focusing on natural Spanish expressions and consistent terminology would markedly improve the quality.\nOverall score (out of 100): 78/100."
