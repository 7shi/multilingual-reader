  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is difficult to follow. Numerous lines are left in English or contain placeholder text (e.g., \"Pre-training\", \"we\", \"formation de plusieurs années\", \"She forgets everything\"). Sentences are fragmented and the flow of the dialogue is broken, making it hard for a Spanish‑speaking reader to grasp the conversation.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural constructions and abrupt code‑switches. Phrases such as \"you can take a model expert in English and then present it a very reduced amount of text in French\" are rendered literally, resulting in awkward Spanish. The mixture of languages and the presence of raw markup (\"---\", \"**\", etc.) further harms fluency.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are partially handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" appear correctly. However, some terms are left in English or are inconsistently formatted (e.g., \"grounding\" is never translated, \"memory\" appears alone). The inconsistent treatment reduces clarity for the target audience.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent—to explain pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning—is recognizable, but the translation fails to adapt idiomatically to Spanish. Cultural references are fine, but the broken sentences and leftover French/English fragments prevent a smooth adaptation.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Significant portions of the original dialogue are omitted or truncated. Several speaker turns are reduced to single words (\"we\", \"anchoring\", \"memory\"), and whole explanatory sentences are missing. Consequently, essential information is lost, and the transcript is incomplete.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the general outline of the podcast but is far from a publishable version. It suffers from missing content, numerous untranslated fragments, inconsistent terminology, and poor fluency, which together hinder readability and comprehension. A thorough revision is needed: remove placeholder text, translate all remaining English/French, ensure consistent technical vocabulary, and rewrite sentences for natural Spanish flow.\n\nScore summary:\n- Readability: 5/20\n- Fluency: 4/20\n- Terminology: 7/20\n- Contextual adaptation: 6/20\n- Information completeness: 4/20\nOverall, the translation is at a low quality level and requires extensive editing."
