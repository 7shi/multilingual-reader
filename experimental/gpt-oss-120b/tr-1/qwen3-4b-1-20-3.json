  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are short and the flow mirrors the original podcast dialogue, making the content accessible to a broad audience. Some occasional long sentences (e.g., the one describing “memoria a corto plazo”) could be split for smoother reading, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few awkward phrasings betray a literal approach. Examples include “Usted ha entendido todo” (should be “¡Lo has entendido!” for a conversational tone) and “el aprendizaje en contexto, es del aplastar” (a mistranslation of “es del bachotage”). Minor grammatical slips and the inconsistent use of “tú” vs. “usted” affect fluency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning”, “transfer learning”, “ventana de contexto” and “ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)” are correctly rendered and consistently used. The translation sometimes adds unnecessary parentheses (e.g., “groundity” instead of “grounding”) and a few terms are slightly off (e.g., “aplastar” instead of “bachotear”). Overall, terminology handling is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely preserves the original intent and tone of a tech‑podcast. Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is needed. However, the shift from informal French (Camille, Luc) to a more formal Spanish (“Usted”) creates a slight mismatch with the conversational style of a podcast. Adjusting pronouns would improve cultural fit.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the “memory” feature. No major omissions are detected. A few minor redundancies appear (repeating the same explanation of “memoria a corto plazo”), but they do not detract from completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and is mostly clear, but it suffers from occasional literal renderings and inconsistent register that make it feel slightly stiff for a podcast audience. Fixing the few mistranslated phrases and aligning pronoun usage would raise fluency and contextual adaptation. Overall, it is a good translation with room for polishing to achieve a fully natural Spanish podcast script."
