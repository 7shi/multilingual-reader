  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure, but several phrasing errors (e.g., “hola y bienvenido en”, “es del aplastar”, “subes en la silla”) create momentary confusion. The dialogue flow is preserved, yet the occasional awkward sentence lowers overall comprehensibility.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are multiple unnatural expressions and grammatical slips that a native speaker would find odd: “Usted ha entendido todo”, “¡Una análoga perfecta!”, “groundity”, and the mistranslation “es del aplastar”. These reduce the smoothness of the translation despite an overall correct tone.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)” are correctly rendered and consistent. The main issue is the mistranslation of “grounding” as “groundity” and the occasional retention of English words like “prompt” without explanation, but the terminology is largely appropriate.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the podcast‑style conversational intent, but cultural and idiomatic adaptation is weak in places (“hola y bienvenido en”, “subes en la silla”). The core message is conveyed, yet the lack of idiomatic polish prevents a fully natural adaptation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the original ideas and dialogue turns are present; no major sections are omitted. Minor nuances are lost in the erroneous phrase “es del aplastar” (intended to mean “bachotage”), but overall the information is complete.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the overall structure and most of the technical content of the original French podcast, but it suffers from several linguistic inaccuracies and unnatural phrasing that hinder readability and fluency. Technical terminology is mostly handled well, though the mistranslation of “grounding” and some literal renderings weaken the quality. With proofreading and idiomatic polishing, the translation could reach a much higher level of naturalness and clarity.\n\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 67/100."
