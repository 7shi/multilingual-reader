  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is riddled with unfinished sentences, bracketed notes, English fragments and meta‑commentary. A Spanish‑speaking reader would have to constantly guess what belongs to the dialogue and what are editorial remarks. The logical flow is broken, making comprehension difficult.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many expressions are literal translations (“una IA completamente nueva”, “una antisèche”) that sound odd in Spanish. There are also abrupt switches to English and French, and awkward phrasing such as “la IA no ha « olvidado » en el sentido humano del término”. Overall the prose does not read naturally.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms like «pre‑entrenamiento», «aprendizaje por transferencia», «aprendizaje en contexto» and «ICL» are correctly rendered, but their surrounding explanations are inconsistent, sometimes left in English or French, and occasionally mis‑translated (e.g., “competencia permanente” instead of a more common “habilidad duradera”). The handling is uneven.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains French cultural references and even English parenthetical notes, showing little adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Some idiomatic Spanish is used, but many sections remain literal and culturally mismatched.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are missing or truncated (e.g., “You can take” without continuation, broken sentences about “grounding”, and missing explanations). The result omits essential clarifications present in the source.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The provided text is far from a finished translation. It appears to be a draft with inline editorial comments, mixed languages, and many incomplete sentences. While some technical vocabulary is correctly transferred, the overall readability, fluency, and completeness are severely compromised, making the translation unsuitable for publication or for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience without substantial editing and rewriting.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 4/20."
