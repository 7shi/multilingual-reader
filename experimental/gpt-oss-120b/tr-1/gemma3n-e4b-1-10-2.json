    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas are easy to follow. Sentences are sometimes long, but the concepts are explained in a way that most readers can understand. Minor issues such as inconsistent use of pronouns (tus/vuestras) do not seriously hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward spots: the hybrid greeting “¡Bonjour y bienvenido/a”, the mixture of “tus” and “vuestras”, and occasional literal renderings (e.g., “una libreta de trucos”). These make the flow feel slightly stilted for a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “anclaje”, etc. The term *prompt* is left in English, which is acceptable in this context. Consistency is good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent, tone and informal register are preserved. The translation adapts the examples to Spanish well, but the occasional mixing of French (“Mémoire”, “que certaines IA”) breaks the cultural adaptation and introduces inconsistency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the main ideas from the original French are present, but the segment about the new “Mémoire” feature retains French fragments, and a few explanatory nuances are lost. No major content is omitted, yet the mixed‑language fragment reduces completeness.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core message of the podcast episode and uses appropriate technical vocabulary. Readability and terminology are strong points, while fluency suffers from occasional literal phrasing and inconsistent pronoun use. The biggest drawback is the residual French wording in the middle of the Spanish text, which disrupts contextual adaptation and completeness. Overall, it is a solid translation that would benefit from a final polish to eliminate mixed‑language fragments and smooth out awkward expressions.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
