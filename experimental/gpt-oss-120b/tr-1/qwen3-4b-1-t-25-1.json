  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but there are several awkward phrasings that may momentarily confuse readers (e.g., \"¡Hola y bienvenido en …\", \"La conocimientos\", \"aprendizaje en última hora\"). Despite these hiccups, the overall narrative and logical flow of the discussion remain clear.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains a number of non‑native constructions and grammatical errors that break the natural rhythm of Spanish (incorrect preposition \"en\" instead of \"a\", gender agreement mistakes, literal translations such as \"bachelor\" for \"bachotage\"). These issues make the text feel stilted, though a native speaker can still follow it.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"grounding\" (anclaje). The term \"prompt\" is left untranslated, which is appropriate for the audience. Minor points are lost for retaining the French word \"antisèche\" instead of a Spanish equivalent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and is adapted to a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience. Small cultural/language mismatches (e.g., \"¡Hola y bienvenido en\" and the use of \"antisèche\") prevent a fully polished adaptation, but the overall purpose and tone are preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas and details from the French source are present; no significant information is omitted. The only loss is stylistic nuance in a few phrases, which does not affect factual completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in transmitting the technical content and the conversational style of the podcast, but it suffers from several grammatical slips and unnatural phrasing that reduce readability and fluency. Technical terminology is well‑managed, and the full information is retained, yet a more careful editorial pass would be needed to reach a native‑like quality.\nOverall score: 77/100."
