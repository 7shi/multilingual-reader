    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable. Sentences follow the original flow and most complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) are explained clearly. A few sentences are slightly clunky (e.g., “es del bachotaje”) which may cause a brief pause, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly natural, but there are several awkward or non‑idiomatic expressions: “El afinado” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”, “es del bachotaje”, “Se podría decir eso” and occasional mismatched register (mix of formal and colloquial). These issues lower the overall smoothness for a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered in most cases: “preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”. The term “fine‑tuning” is left in parentheses, which is acceptable, and the translation of “grounding” as “anclaje” is adequate. Minor inconsistencies such as “afinado” vs. the more precise “ajuste fino” are present, but the terminology overall remains accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., “consultor brillante”). Some phrasing could be refined for Spanish‑speaking audiences (e.g., “es del bachotaje” could be “es como un repaso intensivo”). Overall, the adaptation conveys the original message and tone.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the “memory” feature explanation. No substantive information is omitted, and the translation does not add irrelevant content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transferring the technical content of the podcast from French to Spanish. It is mostly clear and complete, with accurate terminology. The main weaknesses are occasional unnatural phrasing and minor lexical choices that feel slightly off for native speakers. With a few stylistic tweaks, the text would read as completely fluid and idiomatic.\nOverall score (out of 20): 16.4 → rounded to 16."
