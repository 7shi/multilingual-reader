  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is cluttered with extensive meta‑comments, justifications, and unfinished sentences (e.g., “**Justification for translation choices**”, “Luc: starts with”). These intrusions break the flow of the dialogue, making it hard for a Spanish‑speaking reader to follow the conversation. Moreover, several sentences are grammatically incomplete or contain typographical errors, further hurting comprehension.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Even ignoring the annotations, the Spanish is often awkward (“Has todo entendido”, “Las nuevas conocimientos”, “en lugar de enviarlo a seguir un programa de formación de varias años”). There are missing accent marks, gender/number agreement errors, and occasional English fragments (“I see.”). The overall register is inconsistent, swinging between overly formal explanatory notes and informal spoken dialogue, which prevents the translation from sounding natural.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as «pre‑entrenamiento», «afinado», «aprendizaje por transferencia», «aprendizaje en contexto» and the abbreviation ICL are correctly rendered. However, some terms are left in English (\"grounding\"), inconsistently capitalized (\"Memoria\"), or translated in a non‑standard way (\"bachotaje\" for \"cramming\"). The occasional misuse of technical vocabulary reduces consistency.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally preserves the original intent, but cultural adaptation is hampered by the intrusive explanatory notes that are unnecessary for the target audience. Some idiomatic choices are acceptable, yet many sentences remain literal or stilted, and the presence of meta‑commentary shows a lack of proper adaptation for a podcast script intended for Spanish listeners.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French source are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, etc. However, the added justifications and placeholders add noise, and a few fragments are cut off or left incomplete, which makes the text longer than needed and sometimes redundant.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the core technical content but is far from a publishable version. The inclusion of extensive justification blocks, unfinished sentences, and numerous linguistic errors severely damages readability, fluency, and overall polish. A clean version that removes all meta‑comments, corrects grammatical mistakes, ensures consistent terminology, and respects the conversational tone of a podcast would be required for a high‑quality Spanish translation."
