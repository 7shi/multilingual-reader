  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the original structure, but there are several awkward phrasings and a typo (\"conocencias\" instead of \"conocimientos\"). The mix of formal \"Usted\" and informal \"tú\" also disrupts flow. These issues make the text slightly harder to follow for a native reader.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound unnatural for conversational Spanish: \"Hola y bienvenido en\", \"Usted ha entendido todo\", \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es el bachotage\". The inclusion of French terms like \"bachotage\" without adaptation further reduces naturalness. Vocabulary is mostly correct but the overall rhythm is stilted.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well‑handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\" (kept as \"afinamiento\"), \"transfer learning\" (\"aprendizaje por transferencia\"), \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\". Some inconsistency appears (\"afinamiento\" vs \"afinación\") and a few French borrowings remain, but the core terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and explanatory tone, but literal renderings (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenido en\") and the mixed register (formal vs. informal) show limited adaptation to Spanish‑speaking audiences. Cultural nuances are largely respected, yet the phrasing could be smoother.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue content from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas or examples are omitted, and the only drawback is a minor typo that does not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full meaning of the original podcast script and uses appropriate technical vocabulary, but it suffers from several fluency and style issues that make it feel less natural for Spanish listeners. Typos, inconsistent register, and occasional literal translations hinder readability. With a few edits to smooth phrasing and correct errors, the text would be much more polished.\nOverall score (out of 100): 77/100.\nThe main strengths are terminology accuracy and completeness; the main weaknesses are fluency and readability.\nRecommendations: standardize the register (use either \"tú\" consistently), correct typographical errors, replace lingering French terms with Spanish equivalents, and rephrase awkward sentences for a more conversational tone."
