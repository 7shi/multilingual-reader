  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally clear and the dialogue flow is preserved, making the content understandable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. However, a few awkward phrasings such as \"aplastamiento\" for \"bachotage\" and occasional missing punctuation slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several non‑native constructions: the mix of \"tú\" and \"usted\", the untranslated loanword \"antisèche\", grammatical slips like \"cuando usted afinan un modelo\", and the odd choice \"aplastamiento\". These reduce the natural feel of the text despite the overall meaning being intact.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is handled well. Key terms such as \"entrenamiento previo\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"fine‑tuning\" (afinado) and \"grounding\" (anclaje) are correctly rendered and consistent throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone of a podcast discussion, but cultural‑linguistic adaptation is uneven. Formal vs. informal address switches, and the literal translation of some expressions (e.g., \"aplastamiento\") feel out of place for a Spanish audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present. No major ideas are omitted, and the technical explanations remain intact. Minor issues like leaving \"antisèche\" untranslated do not cause loss of meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the technical content accurately and retains the structure of the original dialogue. The main shortcomings are stylistic: a few unnatural word choices, inconsistent pronoun usage, and occasional grammatical errors that affect fluency. Terminology and completeness are strong points, while readability and cultural adaptation could be improved with more idiomatic Spanish phrasing.\n\nScore (out of 100): 82/100.\n\nRecommendations: replace \"aplastamiento\" with a clearer term like \"estudio intensivo\" or \"aprender a presión\", translate \"antisèche\" to \"chuleta\" or \"resumen\", and maintain consistent pronoun form (preferably \"tú\" for a podcast style). A final proofreading pass would raise fluency and readability significantly."
