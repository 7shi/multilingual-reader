    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the dialogue flows well, allowing a reader to follow the discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning. However, a critical segment is left in French (\"Oui, et elle est rendue possible par…\") and the subsequent sentence is garbled, which interrupts comprehension. The omission of the explanation of the \"ventana de contexto\" also forces the reader to infer missing information. Because of these breaks, readability is lowered.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences are natural and idiomatic (e.g., \"es como contratar a un consultor brillante\", \"el aprendizaje en contexto es como bachotear\"). Vocabulary is appropriate for a tech‑savvy audience. The main flaw is the untranslated French phrase and the abrupt transition that sounds like a copy‑paste error, which feels jarring to a native speaker. Aside from that, the style is consistent.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"anclaje\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly rendered. The translation omits the term \"ventana de contexto\" (context window) and the abbreviation ICL, which were present in the original and are important for precision. Consistency is otherwise good.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original conversational tone to Spanish well, using culturally neutral examples (e.g., \"consultor brillante\"). Nonetheless, the missing explanation of the context window reduces the conveyance of the original intent, and the stray French phrase shows a lack of full adaptation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original information is retained, but the crucial passage describing the massive short‑term memory expansion and the term \"ventana de contexto\" is absent. The French fragment left untranslated also indicates loss of content. Therefore, the translation does not fully preserve all details.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation captures the spirit and most of the content of the podcast script, using clear and fluent Spanish. The major issues are a missing segment about the context window, the retention of a French sentence, and the omission of the ICL abbreviation. These gaps affect readability, completeness, and technical precision. With those errors corrected, the translation would be of high quality; as it stands it is decent but incomplete."
