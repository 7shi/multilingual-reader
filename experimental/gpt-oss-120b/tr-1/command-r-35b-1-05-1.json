    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are conveyed in a comprehensible way. Minor issues such as occasional long sentences or slightly redundant phrasing do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, using appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic expressions. A few awkward constructions appear (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotage”, “una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”), and occasional punctuation spacing is off, but these do not severely break the flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding, etc. The English loan‑terms (fine‑tuning) are kept or suitably translated (“especialización”, “refinamiento”). The use of “bachotage” is acceptable in Spanish technical discourse, though a more common synonym could be chosen. Overall terminology handling is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and purpose of the podcast dialogue. Cultural references are adapted (e.g., “consultor brillante”) and the metaphorical explanations remain effective for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only minor lapse is the retention of the original podcast name “Tech Éclair”, which is acceptable as a brand name.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the logical progression of the conversation is intact. Minor stylistic differences do not affect content completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and in a way that is understandable for Spanish listeners. While a few phrasing choices could be smoother, they do not detract significantly from the overall readability and fidelity. Terminology is handled consistently, and the original intent of the dialogue is well preserved. Minor polishing of some awkward sentences would bring the fluency closer to native‑speaker level, but the current version is already very solid for a technical podcast transcript.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 87/100 (average of the five criteria)."
