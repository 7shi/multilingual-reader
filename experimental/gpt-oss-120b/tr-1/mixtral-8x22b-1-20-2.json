  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow and the ideas are clearly expressed. Sentence structures are logical, and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. The only drawback is a duplicated label “Camille: Camille:” which is a minor typographical error but does not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are a few awkward phrasings (“aprendizaje en contexto es repaso intensivo”, “inserta automáticamente estos extractos en la sugerencia”) and the aforementioned label duplication. These issues slightly break the flow for native speakers, though the text remains understandable.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (In‑Context Learning)” and “anclamiento” are correctly rendered and used consistently. Minor nuance (e.g., “grounding” could be rendered as “anclaje”) does not affect clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast script. Cultural references are adapted (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido”). The explanation of memory features is retained, and the analogy with a consultant is appropriately conveyed. Minor typographical duplication slightly detracts but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present; no sections are omitted or altered in meaning. The only issue is the repeated “Camille: Camille:” label, which is a formatting error rather than a loss of content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is generally high‑quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, uses appropriate terminology, and remains readable for a broad audience. Minor typographical and stylistic imperfections prevent a perfect score, but they do not compromise the overall understanding. The translation would benefit from a quick proofread to remove the duplicated label and smooth a few phrasing choices, after which it would be fluent and polished for native speakers.\nOverall score: 88/100."
