  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and conveys the original ideas. Most sentences are clear, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can follow. However, there are occasional awkward phrasings (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenido en…\", \"Usted ha entendido todo\") and a mixed use of formal and informal pronouns that can momentarily confuse the reader.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally, but several constructions sound unnatural to native speakers: the preposition error in \"bienvenido en\", the unnecessary space before the exclamation mark, the switch between \"tú\" and \"Usted\", and the literal retention of \"ancrage\" instead of a Spanish equivalent. These issues lower the overall fluidity.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. \"Preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are accurate. The abbreviation ICL is kept, matching the original. The only minor drawback is keeping \"ancrage\" untranslated, where \"anclaje\" would be more appropriate, but this does not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast conversation. Cultural adaptation is mostly adequate, but the opening greeting \"Hola y bienvenido en\" is not idiomatic Spanish, and the register shift (formal vs. informal) slightly detracts from the natural podcast style. Otherwise, the content is appropriate for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the speaker turns and examples are faithfully reproduced.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and complete, successfully conveying the technical discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning. Minor linguistic issues—especially regarding idiomatic phrasing, consistent register, and the translation of a few borrowed terms—prevent it from sounding completely natural. A modest polish would bring the fluency and readability up to a higher level.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16.6 ≈ 17/20."
