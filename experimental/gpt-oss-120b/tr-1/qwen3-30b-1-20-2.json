  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are not overly fragmented and the logical flow of the podcast dialogue is preserved. A few long sentences could be split for better clarity, but overall a native Spanish reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a handful of awkward or literal renderings (e.g., \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje\", \"el afinamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\"). These minor issues prevent the text from feeling completely fluid for a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly identified and mostly translated appropriately: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\". The choice of \"afinamiento\" for \"fine‑tuning\" is understandable but not the most common term in Spanish technical literature, where \"ajuste fino\" is preferred. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the original podcast tone, the conversational back‑and‑forth, and the explanatory style. No cultural references are missed, and the content is well adapted for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information present in the French original is conveyed in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and no extraneous material is added. The translation is faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is accurate and conveys the original message effectively. Readability and completeness are strong points. Fluency suffers from a few literal constructions and less idiomatic terminology, especially around \"fine‑tuning\" and the phrase describing \"bachotage\". With minor polishing of these spots, the translation would read like a natural, high‑quality Spanish podcast script.\nScore summary: Readability 17/20, Fluency 15/20, Terminology 16/20, Contextual Adaptation 18/20, Information Completeness 20/20."
