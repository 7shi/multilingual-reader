  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are easy to follow. Sentences are generally clear, and complex concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can understand. Minor punctuation issues do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but a few expressions are literal or awkward. The phrase \"memorizando de carril\" is not idiomatic Spanish (the French \"bachotage\" would be better rendered as \"estudiar a presión\" or \"aprender de memoria para un examen\"). Small mismatches like \"vinculación\" for \"grounding\" also feel a bit forced. These issues prevent a perfect fluency score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"ventana de contexto\" are all appropriate. Consistency is maintained throughout the dialogue. Only minor doubt about the translation of \"grounding\" as \"vinculación\", but it is understandable.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the podcast tone and adapts cultural references (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenidos\"). Most expressions fit a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only notable mis‑fit is the literal translation of \"bachotage\" mentioned above, which slightly reduces the cultural naturalness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is preserved. Redundancies are not introduced, and the translation remains concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and comprehensive, with strong handling of technical terminology and clear exposition of concepts. Readability is high, but fluency suffers from a few literal, non‑idiomatic phrases that could be refined. Overall, it is a solid translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI topics, requiring only minor stylistic tweaks for native‑speaker polish.\n\n**Total score (out of 100): 87**"
