  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. Sentence structures are logical, and a listener can understand the discussion. Minor issues such as the typo “crammar” (should be “estudiar para un examen”) and occasional literal phrasing slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few expressions feel awkward to native speakers (e.g., “afinado” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”, “crammar” typo, “el espacio de trabajo temporal simplemente ha sido vaciado”). Vocabulary is appropriate overall, yet these small slips reduce fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well handled: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, grounding → anclaje, etc. The only slight inconsistency is the use of “afinado/afinamiento” for fine‑tuning, which is understandable but not the most standard term.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts the examples to Spanish‑speaking listeners adequately. Cultural references are neutral and the consultant analogy works. Minor phrasing choices could be smoother, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the logical flow of the podcast dialogue is maintained. The only drawback is the typo that does not affect meaning but reflects a minor oversight.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is accurate and conveys the technical discussion clearly. It captures the nuance between fine‑tuning and in‑context learning, and the metaphor of a temporary consultant versus a permanent expert is preserved. The main weaknesses are a few unnatural lexical choices and a typographical error, which prevent a perfect score but do not impair comprehension significantly. The translation would benefit from polishing terms like “fine‑tuning” to “ajuste fino” and correcting the typo, after which it would read as a very fluent Spanish podcast script.\n\nOverall rating (average of criteria): 16/20."
