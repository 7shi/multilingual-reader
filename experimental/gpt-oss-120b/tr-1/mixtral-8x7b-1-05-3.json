  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and conveys the main ideas clearly. Sentences are mostly well‑structured, and complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia y aprendizaje en contexto are explained in accessible language. Minor issues (e.g., occasional awkward phrasing) do not significantly impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several fluency problems that make the translation feel non‑native: the gender error \"El IA\" (should be \"la IA\"), inconsistent use of \"afinar\" vs. \"ajuste fino\", and occasional overly literal renderings (e.g., \"una chuleta\" for \"cheat‑sheet\", which is colloquial but may feel out of place in a technical podcast). These reduce the naturalness of the text.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved, but some choices are sub‑optimal. \"Ancrage\" is left in French with only an English gloss, whereas the proper Spanish term would be \"anclaje\". \"Fine‑tuning\" is rendered as \"afinar (fine‑tuning)\" in one place and \"ajuste fino\" elsewhere, causing inconsistency. Overall the terminology is understandable but not fully adapted.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references well (e.g., consultant metaphor). The explanations remain appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Apart from the few lexical slips noted above, the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No relevant detail is omitted, and the flow of the dialogue is maintained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full content of the podcast and is generally clear, but it suffers from recurring gender errors, inconsistent terminology, and occasional unnatural phrasing. Fixing \"la IA\", standardising technical terms (e.g., using \"anclaje\" and \"ajuste fino\"), and smoothing some colloquial turns would raise the quality substantially.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20.\n\nScore: 16"
