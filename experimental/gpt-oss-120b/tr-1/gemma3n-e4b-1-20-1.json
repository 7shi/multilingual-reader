  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the dialogue flow is clear. However, there are several awkward phrasings (e.g., “las informaciones”, “vuestro historial”) and inconsistent use of pronouns that slightly hinder smooth reading. The presence of an unfinished French sentence also disrupts comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but occasional literal renderings and the mix of regional forms (\"vuestro\" vs. \"tu\") make it feel uneven. The leftover French fragment and the truncated sentence are glaring fluency errors.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, grounding) are correctly translated and consistently used. Minor issues include the plural \"informaciones\" and the omission of the explicit translation of “ventana de contexto”, but overall terminology handling is solid.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator generally adapts the content for a Spanish‑speaking audience, preserving the podcast style and explanations. Cultural adaptation is adequate, yet the unfinished French sentence and some literal translations reduce the overall adaptation quality.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original information is retained, but the crucial clause about the \"expansion massive de la mémoire à court terme… (fenêtre de contexte)\" is omitted, and the French placeholder remains. This loss of content lowers completeness.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main ideas of the podcast and uses appropriate technical vocabulary, but it suffers from several noticeable flaws: an unfinished French sentence left in the text, occasional unnatural phrasing, inconsistent pronoun usage, and the omission of a key explanatory clause about the context window. These issues affect readability, fluency, and completeness, preventing the translation from reaching a high professional standard. With careful editing to remove the stray French, harmonize pronouns, and restore the missing explanation, the quality could be significantly improved.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14/20."
