  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are short enough for a podcast audience and the flow mirrors the original dialogue. Complex ideas such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto are explained with clear analogías (graduado, consultor, bachotaje). A few expressions (e.g., \"atiborrarse de estudio\") are slightly less common but still understandable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for native speakers. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. Minor awkwardness appears in a couple of places (\"pre‑entrenamiento\" con guion, \"documentos informativos exactos\"), but they do not break the flow. Overall the text sounds like a spoken podcast rather than a literal translation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" y \"grounding\". The translator kept the English term \"grounding\" in quotes, which is acceptable given the lack of a widely used Spanish equivalent. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original (informal, didactic, conversational) are preserved. Cultural references are neutral, and the Spanish wording respects the target audience. The analogy of a \"consultor\" and the explanation of \"memoria\" features are adapted well for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No key idea is omitted, and the order of the dialogue is maintained. The translation adds no unnecessary redundancy and keeps the content concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational style of a podcast, and is largely fluent and readable. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve naturalness, but they do not affect comprehension. The translator shows solid mastery of both languages and the subject matter.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 88"
