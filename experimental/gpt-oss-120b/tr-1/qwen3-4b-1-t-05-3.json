  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences are clear, but there are a few minor slips (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenido en\" instead of \"Hola y bienvenido a\", and occasional awkward phrasing) that slightly hinder smooth comprehension for a native reader.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, yet some literal renderings from French create slightly stilted expressions (e.g., \"el afinado\", \"Mira esto:\" and the inconsistent use of \"fundamento\" for \"grounding\"). Overall, a native speaker would understand it without difficulty, but a few phrases feel non‑idiomatic.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly translated (\"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"prompt\"). However, there is inconsistency in translating \"fine‑tuning\" (\"ajuste fino\" vs \"afinado\") and a somewhat vague translation of \"grounding\" as \"anclaje (fundamento)\". The core terminology is accurate but could be more consistent.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the informal podcast tone and conveys the original intent well. Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience, though the opening greeting could be smoother. Overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original script is present; no significant content is omitted or added unnecessarily. The translation remains faithful to the source while keeping the length comparable.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. It captures the conversational style of the podcast and retains most of the original meaning. Minor issues with fluency, terminology consistency, and a few unnatural phrasing prevent it from being perfect, but the overall quality is high and the content is complete.\n\nStrengths: completeness, preservation of technical concepts, overall readability. Areas for improvement: smoother idiomatic phrasing, consistent use of technical terms, and correcting small grammatical slips.\n\nOverall rating: 16/20, indicating a good translation with room for refinement toward native‑like polish.\n\n---\n**Scoring Summary**\n- Readability: 16/20\n- Fluency: 15/20\n- Terminology: 14/20\n- Contextual Adaptation: 16/20\n- Information Completeness: 19/20\n- **Overall Score:** 16/20"
