  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly short and the logical flow mirrors the original. A few constructions feel slightly clunky (e.g., “competencia permanente” instead of “habilidad permanente”), but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, but there are occasional awkward phrases such as “El pre‑entrenamiento.” (the hyphen is unnecessary), the repetition in “Aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”, and minor grammatical slips like “solo le dieron una guía”. These issues keep the text from being fully native‑speaker smooth.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje, etc. The translator kept consistency and provided appropriate Spanish equivalents, preserving the technical nuance.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent of the podcast dialogue is preserved and the language is adapted for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only notable inconsistency is the podcast name: it stays “Tech Éclair” at the start but becomes “Tech Destello” at the end, which could confuse listeners. Apart from that, cultural adaptation is adequate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is omitted, and the added clarifications (e.g., a brief note on how ICL works) do not alter the original meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is solid: technical concepts are accurately conveyed and the text is largely understandable. Minor fluency hiccups and a slight inconsistency in the podcast title prevent it from being perfect, but the translation succeeds in delivering the original content to a Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\nStrengths: correct terminology, faithful content transfer, good readability. Areas for improvement: smoother phrasing in a few spots and consistent naming of the podcast throughout the script.\n\nScore summary: Readability 17/20, Fluency 16/20, Terminology 18/20, Contextual Adaptation 16/20, Information Completeness 19/20."
