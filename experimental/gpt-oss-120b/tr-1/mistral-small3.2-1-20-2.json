  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas and the podcast dialogue format is preserved. Minor issues such as duplicated speaker tags (e.g., “Luc: Luc:”) and a few overly long sentences slightly hinder smooth reading, but the overall comprehension is good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are occasional awkward constructions and literal renderings (e.g., “Lo han entendido todo”, “chuleta” is very colloquial, “prompt” is left in English). The duplicated labels and a few redundant words break the flow. Nevertheless, a native speaker would understand it without major difficulty.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly translated and consistently used: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje. The choice of “afinamiento” for fine‑tuning is acceptable, though “ajuste fino” is more common. The term “prompt” is left untranslated, which could be clarified, but overall terminology handling is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The informal podcast tone is maintained, and cultural equivalents such as “chuleta” convey the idea of a cheat‑sheet. The translation respects the original intent and makes the content relatable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor cultural mismatches (e.g., some Latin‑American specific slang) do not detract significantly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present. No substantive content is lost; only formatting artifacts (duplicate speaker labels) are added, which do not affect the factual completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is clear and faithful to the source, preserving the educational and conversational tone of the podcast. While there are a few repetitive labels, minor literal choices, and occasional colloquial wording, the core concepts are accurately conveyed and the technical terminology is well handled. Minor polishing would bring it to a higher level of fluency, but the current version is already quite functional for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\n**Overall score:** 16/20"
