    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the main ideas are conveyed clearly. Most sentences are short enough for listeners of a podcast format. However, there are occasional awkward constructions (e.g., \"Lo tienes todo claro\", \"experto de tus datos\", \"Voyez plutôt\" left in French) that may cause a brief pause for the reader. Overall, comprehension is good but not perfectly smooth.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several non‑native sounding phrases and some literal borrowings from the French source that feel out of place in Spanish. Examples include the untranslated \"Voyez plutôt\", the literal \"El aprendizaje en contexto es aprender de memoria\", and the mixture of English technical words (prompt, grounding) without adaptation. While the meaning is preserved, the flow is disrupted in multiple places, reducing naturalness.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"memoria a corto plazo\" and the acronyms AIC are correctly introduced. The decision to keep English terms such as \"prompt\" and \"grounding\" with brief explanations is appropriate for a tech‑savvy audience. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the original podcast tone and intent, adapting the content for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the explanatory style remains intact. Minor lapses (e.g., a French interjection left untranslated) do not significantly alter the message, but they slightly break immersion.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No key concept, example, or nuance is omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is kept. The translation even includes the extra meta‑commentary about evaluation, which does not detract from completeness.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content and the conversational style of the original podcast. Terminology is accurate and consistent, and no essential information is lost. Nevertheless, the text suffers from several non‑native phrasing issues and a few remnants of French that hinder fluency and readability. A careful edit to smooth out these awkward expressions would raise the quality substantially.\n\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 81/100."
