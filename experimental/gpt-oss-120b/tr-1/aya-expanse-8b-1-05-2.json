  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Most sentences convey the original ideas without ambiguity, and the dialogue flow is preserved. Minor issues such as isolated fragments (e.g., “El preentrenamiento.”) and occasional redundancy slightly affect smoothness, but overall a Spanish‑speaking reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly naturally, but there are a few literal renderings that feel awkward to native speakers: “el aprendizaje por computadora” instead of “aprendizaje en contexto”, mixed use of “afinado” vs. “ajuste fino”, and some stilted phrasing like “El preentrenamiento.” as a standalone line. These quirks prevent full fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly – preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, grounding (anclaje). However, inconsistency appears (“afinado” vs. “ajuste fino”) and a mistranslation of ICL as “Aprendizaje por Computadora”. Such inconsistencies reduce the precision of the terminology.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast style well to Spanish, using appropriate salutations and idiomatic expressions. The name change to “Tecnología Rápida” and later “Tech Claridad” deviates from the original brand “Tech Éclair”, which is a minor loss of brand fidelity, but the overall intent and tone are preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are retained: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the explanation of the “memory” feature. No essential information is omitted, though the mis‑labeling of ICL slightly muddies the technical nuance.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core message of the podcast episode accurately and is largely readable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Strengths include faithful transmission of concepts and overall coherence. Weaknesses lie in occasional literal phrasing, inconsistent terminology, and a few branding mismatches. With minor revisions—especially correcting the ICL label and harmonising technical terms—the translation would reach a higher level of polish.\n\nOverall rating: 15 / 20 (75 / 100)."
