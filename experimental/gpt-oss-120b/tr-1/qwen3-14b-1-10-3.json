  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas, and the dialogue format is preserved. A few long sentences and minor punctuation issues (e.g., missing \"la\" in \"estudiar a última hora\") slightly hinder smooth reading, but overall a native reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally, with appropriate verb tenses and idiomatic phrasing. There are some awkward spots such as \"fine‑tuning\" kept in English, \"estudiar a última hora\" (should be \"estudiar a la última hora\"), and occasional redundancy (\"memoria a corto plazo\" repeated). These do not break comprehension but prevent the text from feeling completely native.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly. \"pre‑entrenamiento\" and \"ventana de contexto\" are good translations. The author sometimes leaves English terms (\"fine‑tuning\", \"ICL\") which is acceptable for a tech‑savvy audience, though a consistent Spanish equivalent (\"ajuste fino\") would be preferable. Overall term usage is consistent and appropriate for the target level.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original conversational tone to Spanish well, using familiar analogies (consultor brillante, aprender a montar en bicicleta). Cultural references are neutral, so they work for any Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor improvements could be made in phrasing, but the intent and purpose of the original are fully preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is lost, and the explanations remain intact. The only minor loss is the nuance of the French term \"ancrage\" which is translated as \"anclaje (grounding)\" – the meaning is kept, so completeness is high.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. Readability and completeness are strong, while fluency and terminology could be polished by eliminating a few English leftovers and fixing small grammatical slips. The text would be easily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners of a tech podcast, and it maintains the original’s educational and conversational tone. Minor refinements would bring it to a near‑perfect level."
