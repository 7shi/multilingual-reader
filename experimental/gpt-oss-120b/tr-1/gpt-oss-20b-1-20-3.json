  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the flow of ideas mirrors the original French. The only minor hiccup is a slightly odd question formulation (\"¿Es decir?\") that does not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally for native Spanish speakers. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. A couple of very small awkward spots (e.g., \"¿Es decir?\" and a missing space before «olvidado») prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled expertly: pre‑training → \"preentrenamiento\", fine‑tuning → \"ajuste fino\"/\"afinamiento\", transfer learning → \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", in‑context learning → \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL kept), grounding → \"anclaje (grounding)\", etc. No important term is lost or mistranslated.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and explanatory style. Cultural references are neutral, and the examples (consultant analogy, bicycle analogy) are conveyed naturally in Spanish.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present. No content is omitted, no redundant additions are made, and the technical explanations remain complete.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of excellent quality. It conveys the technical concepts accurately, reads smoothly, and maintains the podcast’s conversational tone. Minor stylistic quirks are the only noticeable imperfections, but they do not affect the understanding of the material.\n\nThe translation would be fully satisfactory for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI fundamentals and the nuances of fine‑tuning versus in‑context learning.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 19.4/20, rounded to 19/20."
