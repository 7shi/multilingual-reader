  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear order. Most sentences are easy to follow, and the dialogue format is preserved. A few long sentences (e.g., the explanation of “ventana de contexto”) could be broken up for better clarity, but overall a Spanish‑speaking listener can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker. Word choices such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje en contexto” and “ventana de contexto” are idiomatic. Minor awkwardness appears in a couple of places – for instance, “el concepto de 'ancramiento' (fijación)” mixes languages and could be rendered simply as “anclaje”. Overall the language is smooth and contemporary.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: “transfer learning” → “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “in‑context learning” → “aprendizaje en contexto”, “grounding” → “anclaje”. The translator kept the English acronyms (ICL) and explained them, which is appropriate for the target audience. Some terms like “memoria a corto plazo” are accurate, though the phrase “expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo” sounds a bit literal; nevertheless the terminology is consistent and understandable.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately. The conversational tone is preserved, and the examples (consultant vs. specialist) are clear for Spanish listeners. The only minor issue is the occasional unnecessary duplication of speaker tags (e.g., “Camille: Camille: ¿Qué quieres decir?”) which is a copy‑editing slip rather than a contextual problem.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is omitted, and the explanation of “memoria” features is intact. Redundancies are minimal; the only small redundancy is the duplicated speaker label mentioned above. The content remains complete and faithful to the source.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical discussion clearly, uses appropriate terminology, and sounds natural to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor typographical and stylistic issues (a duplicated speaker label and a slightly literal phrase) prevent a perfect score, but they do not affect comprehension. Overall, the work successfully adapts the original French podcast script into fluent, accurate Spanish.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 18/20, Fluency 17/20, Terminology 16/20, Contextual Adaptation 17/20, Information Completeness 19/20. Total: 87/100.\n\nRecommendations: • Remove the duplicated \"Camille:\" label. • Consider simplifying \"el concepto de 'ancramiento' (fijación)\" to \"el concepto de anclaje\". • Slightly split the longest sentences for easier reading.\n\nThese tweaks would bring the translation closer to a perfect score."
