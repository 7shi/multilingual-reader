  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is riddled with unfinished sentences, abrupt line‑breaks and stray English fragments (e.g., “totally new/o”, “You've got it all”). Many paragraphs jump from one idea to another without clear connectors, making it hard for a reader to follow the logical flow of the podcast dialogue.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Numerous expressions are unnatural for native speakers: literal translations like “aprendizaje a corto plazo” appear without context, English sentences are left untouched, and there are parenthetical editorial notes that break the narrative. The result is a choppy, non‑idiomatic Spanish version.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL) are present, but inconsistently rendered (e.g., “afinage” is never translated, “fine‑tuning” is omitted). Some terms are left in English or explained with meta‑comments that would not appear in a proper translation.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to adapt cultural or stylistic aspects: it retains the original French‑style podcast framing, includes editorial notes about translation choices, and mixes languages. The intended conversational tone is lost, and the Spanish audience receives a disjointed script.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are missing or truncated (e.g., the closing lines, several explanatory sentences, and the “consultant vs. expert” question). Additionally, placeholder text and explanatory side‑bars replace actual content, resulting in significant loss of information.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is far from ready for publication. It contains many unfinished sentences, English insertions, and editorial meta‑comments that interrupt the flow. Technical terminology is only partially transferred, and several crucial parts of the original conversation are omitted. A thorough rewrite is needed: translate all missing segments, remove the editorial notes, ensure consistent use of Spanish technical terms, and polish the prose to achieve a natural, coherent podcast script for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 4.4 ≈ 4/20."
