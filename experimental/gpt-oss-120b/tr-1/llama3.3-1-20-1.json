  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and follows a logical progression. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto are explained in a way that a non‑expert can follow. There are a few minor punctuation issues and occasional long sentences that could be broken up, but overall the reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several spots that feel slightly off for native speakers: “Ustedes han entendido todo” (should be “Has entendido todo” or “Lo has entendido”), the abrupt shift from ICL to AIC without explanation, and a few literal renderings like “ventana de contexto” that, while understandable, are not the most idiomatic choice. Vocabulary is appropriate, but the occasional awkward phrasing lowers fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto” and “anclaje” are correctly translated and used consistently. The only slight inconsistency is the change of the abbreviation ICL to AIC, which could confuse readers familiar with the original acronym. Overall, the terminology is accurate and appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts cultural references suitably for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The metaphor of a consultant and the exam‑cramming analogy are retained. Minor issues include the aforementioned “Ustedes han entendido todo” and the lack of a brief note about the new abbreviation (AIC), which could have been clarified. Nevertheless, the core message and tone are well conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the explanations remain complete. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy, and supplemental clarifications are minimal but sufficient. The only tiny loss is the explicit mention that “ICL” stands for “In‑Context Learning”, which is replaced by a parenthetical Spanish translation; this does not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. Readability and completeness are strong, and terminology is mostly spot‑on. Fluency suffers from a few unnatural constructions and the unexplained abbreviation change, which prevent it from being completely seamless. Minor editorial tweaks would bring it to a higher level of polish, but as it stands the translation is functional and informative for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\n**Overall Score:** 17/20"
