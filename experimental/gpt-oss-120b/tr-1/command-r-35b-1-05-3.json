  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the flow of the dialogue mirrors the original. A few long sentences could be split for better clarity, but overall a native reader can understand the concepts without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation sounds natural, but there are noticeable awkward spots. The use of the French word *bachotage* (\"El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotage\") is out of place in Spanish. Minor phrasing issues such as \"¡El aprendizaje contextual en acción!\" instead of \"¡El aprendizaje en contexto en acción!\" also break the fluidity. These errors prevent the text from feeling completely native.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered: *preentrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *transfer learning*, *in‑context learning (ICL)*, *grounding*. The translator kept some English terms in quotes, which is acceptable in a technical podcast. The main drawback is the retention of the French term *bachotage* instead of a Spanish equivalent, which could confuse readers unfamiliar with French.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original tone and intent, preserving the podcast‑style banter. Cultural references are minimal, so no major adaptation is required. A few expressions could be more idiomatic for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but the overall message and persuasive framing remain intact.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All factual content from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas or examples were omitted, and the logical progression of the discussion is preserved. The only minor issue is the occasional redundancy caused by literal translations, but this does not affect the completeness of the information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast’s educational content accurately and maintains the conversational flow. Readability and completeness are strong points. Fluency suffers from a few non‑Spanish terms and slightly stilted phrasing, and the terminology section is mostly solid except for the misplaced French word. With minor polishing—replacing *bachotage* with a Spanish equivalent and smoothing a few awkward sentences—the translation would be fully natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\nOverall, the work is good, showing solid grasp of the technical material, but it needs a bit of linguistic fine‑tuning to reach native‑level fluidity.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
