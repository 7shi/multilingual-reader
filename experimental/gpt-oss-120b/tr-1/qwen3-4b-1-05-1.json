    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure. Most sentences convey the ideas clearly, but there are a few awkward phrasings (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenida en…”, “conocencias” instead of “conocimientos”) that may cause momentary hiccups for the reader. Overall, a native speaker can follow the discussion without major difficulty.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, yet several literal renderings betray the source language (“¡Hola y bienvenida en…”, “el aprendizaje previo” instead of the more common “pre‑entrenamiento”). Some gender and formality inconsistencies (mix of “tú” and “usted”) also affect fluidity. Nonetheless, the discourse flows and the conversation tone is retained.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is largely handled correctly: “fine‑tuning” → “afinamiento”, “transfer learning” explained, “In‑Context Learning” → “Aprendizaje en contexto”, “ventana de contexto”, “grounding” → “anclaje”. Minor inconsistency appears between “entrenamiento previo” and “preentrenamiento”, and a typo (“conocencias”). Overall terminology is appropriate and consistent enough for the intended audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent, tone, and explanatory style. Cultural adaptation is limited but not problematic; the only noticeable issue is the unnatural opening phrase and occasional mixing of formal/informal registers. The content remains relevant for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No substantive information is omitted, only minor lexical slips.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full technical content of the original podcast and is largely clear. Strengths lie in accurate terminology and faithful preservation of the dialogue format. Weaknesses are mainly stylistic: a few literal translations, a typo, and inconsistent formality that slightly reduce naturalness. With a modest polish (correcting “bienvenida en” → “bienvenida a”, fixing “conocencias”, harmonising the term for pre‑training, and choosing a consistent register), the text would read like a native‑crafted script.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
