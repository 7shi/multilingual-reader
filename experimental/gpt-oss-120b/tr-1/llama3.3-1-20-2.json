  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas and complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento and aprendizaje en contexto are explained clearly. Minor hiccups (e.g., “Ustedes han entendido todo” and occasional long sentences) slightly hinder smooth comprehension, but overall a Spanish‑speaking listener can understand the podcast script without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally, but a few expressions feel awkward or overly literal: “Ustedes han entendido todo”, “La integralidad del historial de su discusión”, and the use of “Ustedes” instead of a singular “tú”/“usted” for a dialogue between two hosts. Vocabulary is appropriate, yet the flow could be smoother in those spots.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, y grounding (traducido como “anclaje”) are all rendered correctly and consistently. The abbreviation ICL is changed to AIC, which is explained, so readers are not confused.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the cultural context of a Spanish‑language podcast. The style is conversational and the examples remain relevant. The only slight mis‑fit is the plural “Ustedes” which feels formal for a host‑to‑host exchange, but overall the intent and tone of the original are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant details are omitted, and the explanations remain as thorough as the source. Redundancies are minimal and the content stays concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is very good overall. It transmits the full content of the podcast accurately and uses appropriate technical vocabulary. Readability and contextual fidelity are strong, while fluency could be improved by smoothing a few unnatural phrases and adjusting the pronoun choice. The translation would be easily understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17.4 ≈ 17.5 out of 20.\n\n**Final score:** 17.5/20"
