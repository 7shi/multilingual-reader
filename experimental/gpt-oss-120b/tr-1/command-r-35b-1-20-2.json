  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but several elements break the flow: an English word \"Thus\" is left untranslated, a raw JSON‑like block appears in the middle of a dialogue, and French slang \"bachotage\" is used without explanation. These disrupt comprehension for a native reader.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are multiple unnatural expressions: \"le proporcionaron un truco\" (odd choice for \"cheat sheet\"), the unexplained JSON snippet, and inconsistent naming of the podcast (\"Tech Relámpago\" vs. \"Tech Éclair\"). Sentence structures are occasionally clunky, reducing the natural feel.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and the acronym ICL are correctly rendered. However, the French term \"bachotage\" is kept, and the translation of \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\" could be clarified. Overall, terminology is mostly accurate.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent, but cultural adaptation is uneven. The use of French‑specific slang, the leftover English word, and the inconsistent podcast name show a lack of careful adaptation for Spanish‑speaking audiences.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are present; no major information is omitted. The extraneous JSON block is an error but does not remove content. The translation therefore remains largely complete.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the core concepts of the original podcast script, but it suffers from several glaring editorial oversights (untranslated English, stray JSON, French slang) and occasional awkward phrasing. Technical terminology is mostly well handled, yet the text needs polishing to reach a fluent, native‑speaker quality.\n\nOverall, the translation is functional but far from polished, earning a modest score.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 10/20, Fluency 9/20, Terminology 13/20, Contextual Adaptation 11/20, Information Completeness 15/20.\n\nAverage (rounded) = 12/20.\n\nRecommendations: Remove the JSON artifact, translate or replace \"Thus\" and \"bachotage\", ensure consistent naming of the podcast, and replace \"truco\" with a more appropriate term such as \"pista\" or \"ayuda\". Also, verify that all English or French remnants are fully localized.\n\n**Overall score:** 12/20."
