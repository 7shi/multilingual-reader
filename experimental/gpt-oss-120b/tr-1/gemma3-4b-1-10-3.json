  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, but there are several interruptions and stray fragments (e.g., \"suelen\" after Camille’s line, incomplete sentences like \"Cuando abre una nueva ventana\"). Punctuation errors and leftover comment markers (//) also distract the reader. While the main ideas are conveyed, the flow is occasionally broken, which reduces overall comprehension.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound unnatural or are poorly phrased: \"el afinamiento … Es como enviar a este graduado para que siga una especialización.”, \"¿Porque ya entiende…\" (missing accent), \"¡Es como bachorear!\" (awkward), and the abrupt truncation of several lines. The translation mixes formal and colloquial registers inconsistently, and some English terms remain untranslated without explanation. These issues prevent the text from reading as smooth, native Spanish.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", \"ventana de contexto\". However, \"fine‑tuning\" is translated as \"afinamiento\" (acceptable but less common than \"ajuste fino\"), and the word \"prompt\" is left in English without clarification. Consistency is decent but not perfect.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the original explanatory tone, but several literal renderings feel odd in Spanish. Cultural adaptation is minimal – the script could have used more natural Spanish idioms. Moreover, the leftover comment syntax (//) and missing parts detract from a seamless adaptation to the target audience.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The bulk of the content is present, but there are noticeable omissions and cut‑offs: the explanation about \"l'espace de travail temporaire\" is truncated, the line \"Camille: la gran pregunta\" is incomplete, and some explanatory bridges are lost. While no major concepts are omitted, the gaps reduce completeness.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the core concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning, but suffers from editing oversights, missing fragments, and occasional unnatural phrasing. Terminology is mostly appropriate, yet inconsistencies and untranslated jargon remain. Overall, the text is understandable but would require careful proofreading and stylistic polishing to reach a high‑quality native Spanish version.\n\n**Overall Score (average of criteria): 12/20**"
