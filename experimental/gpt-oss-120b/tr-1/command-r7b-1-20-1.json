  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the main ideas clearly and the dialogue flow is easy to follow. Most sentences are understandable, but there are occasional punctuation issues (excessive exclamation marks, missing spaces) and a few typographical errors that slightly disrupt smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward constructions and grammatical slips (e.g., \"¡Gracias por haber nos escuchado!\", \"anchora\" instead of a proper noun, inconsistent use of \"¡Exacto.\" vs \"¡Exacto!\", missing accents). These reduce the overall fluidity for native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"ICL (Aprendizaje In‑Context)\" are correctly rendered. The translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"afinar\" is acceptable, though \"ajuste fino\" would be more precise. The term \"grounding\" is rendered as \"anchora\", which is not a standard Spanish term; \"anclaje\" or \"fundamentación\" would be preferable. Overall terminology is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the informal, conversational tone of the podcast and kept the analogies (consultant, exam preparation, bicycle). Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor lexical choices (e.g., \"consultor brillante\") are fitting, but the earlier terminology mishap slightly weakens the adaptation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas or sections are omitted, and the dialogue structure is maintained. Small typographic errors do not constitute loss of content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely faithful and conveys the technical content in an accessible way. It succeeds in preserving the podcast’s lively style and most of the technical terminology. However, several linguistic inaccuracies—especially punctuation, a few grammatical mistakes, and an incorrect translation of the term \"grounding\"—prevent it from being fully natural for native Spanish readers. With minor revisions, the text would reach a higher level of polish.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
