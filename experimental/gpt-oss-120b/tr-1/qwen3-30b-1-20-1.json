  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. Sentence flow is logical, but a few constructions (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje”, “El afinamiento”) feel slightly clunky and may require a second reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several non‑idiomatic choices: “El afinamiento” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”, “¡Lo has comprendido todo!” instead of “¡Lo has entendido todo!”, and occasional misplaced commas. Overall a native speaker would understand it, yet the text lacks the smoothness of a fully native version.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well. “Pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “ventana de contexto” and “anclaje” are appropriate and used consistently. The only minor point is the choice of “afinamiento” for fine‑tuning, which is acceptable but not the most common term.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and persuasive style. Cultural references are neutral and the analogies (consultant, studying for an exam) work in Spanish. Small stylistic tweaks could make it feel more tailored to Spanish‑speaking audiences, but the overall adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas, examples, and nuances from the French script are retained. No relevant information is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary material.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the full content of the original podcast script. It is readable and technically sound, though a few lexical choices and sentence constructions prevent it from feeling completely natural to native Spanish speakers. Minor revisions—especially replacing \"afinamiento\" with \"ajuste fino\" and smoothing out a few awkward phrases—would raise the fluency and readability scores. Nonetheless, the translation is functional and faithful to the source material."
