    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the dialogue flow mirrors the original French. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained clearly, and the occasional short standalone lines (e.g., « El pre‑entrenamiento. ») do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and the style is conversational, matching a podcast script. Minor quirks appear (e.g., the use of “partís” which is region‑specific, and occasional English terms like “prompt”), but they do not break fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino” (fine‑tuning), “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and “anclaje (grounding)”. The English acronyms are retained with Spanish explanations, which is standard in this field. No inconsistent terminology is observed.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and purpose of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral, and the Spanish phrasing respects the target audience (e.g., using “¡Exactamente!” for emphasis). The only slight adaptation issue is the use of “vosotros” form (“partís”), which may feel odd to Latin‑American listeners, but it does not affect overall comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted or added unnecessarily. The dialogue remains concise while retaining every explanatory detail.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, reads smoothly, and maintains the lively podcast atmosphere. Minor regional language choices and the occasional retention of English terms are the only noticeable imperfections, but they do not detract from the overall effectiveness of the translation.\nOverall score: 18/20."
