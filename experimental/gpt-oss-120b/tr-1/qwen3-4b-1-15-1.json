  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original. Most sentences are understandable, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in plain language. However, there are a few typographical errors (e.g., “francen”, “conocencias”) and occasional overly long sentences that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several expressions are awkward for native speakers: “es del cram” is not idiomatic Spanish, the word “conocencias” is incorrect, and the mixture of English terms (fine‑tuning, grounding) without Spanish equivalents feels inconsistent. These issues prevent a fully fluent reading.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: “preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL” are correctly rendered. The occasional retention of English words like “grounding” is acceptable in a tech‑focused podcast, and the translation remains consistent throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator conveys the original intent and tone, adapting the pedagogical analogies for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor cultural mismatches appear (e.g., “es del cram” which is not a Spanish expression), but overall the content is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original. The only drawbacks are the small typographical errors that do not affect the factual content.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical discussion about AI training methods, maintaining the educational tone of the podcast. While the terminology is accurate and the content complete, a few linguistic slips (typos, non‑idiomatic phrases) and inconsistent use of English terms reduce fluency. With minor revisions the text would read as a polished, native‑level Spanish script.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
