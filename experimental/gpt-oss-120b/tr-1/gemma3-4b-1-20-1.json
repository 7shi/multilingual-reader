    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original flow. However, several grammatical slips (e.g., “Las conocimientos”, “Ella olvida todo”, “ha simplemente sido vacío”) and missing words in the school‑analogy sentence make reading a bit choppy. Native readers can follow the ideas, but the errors slightly impede smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are many unnatural constructions and typographical repetitions (e.g., double “Camille:” and “Luc: Luc:” prefixes). Phrases such as “una forma astucia”, “las informaciones”, and the incorrect gender agreement detract from a natural sounding translation. The overall style feels literal rather than fluid.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning” as “afinado”, “in‑context learning” as “aprendizaje en contexto”, etc. The term “ancrage” is left in French with a parenthetical translation, which is acceptable but could be fully localized to “anclaje”. Minor inconsistencies (e.g., “un experto de sus datos”) reduce the score.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and explanatory tone. Cultural references are neutral and appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only notable omission is the phrase “pour lui donner une culture générale” after the school analogy, which slightly reduces the completeness of the adaptation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory features) are present. The missing part of the school analogy and a few minor omissions (e.g., the nuance of “culture générale”) are the only gaps. No major factual information is lost.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core ideas of the podcast episode and would be understandable to most Spanish listeners. Nevertheless, it suffers from frequent grammatical errors, occasional unnatural phrasing, and a small loss of detail. A careful proofreading and tighter localization of technical terms would raise the quality considerably.\nOverall score (out of 100): 68/100."
