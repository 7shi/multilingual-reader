  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the dialogue format is preserved. However, there are a few confusing passages (e.g., “Luc: Tela es la realidad del ICL.”) and inconsistent use of formal/informal pronouns that slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural, but occasional awkward constructions (“le dimos un esquema o una guía justo antes de que empezara a hablar con usted”, mixed register, and the unexplained word “Tela”) break the flow. Overall the translation reads fairly fluently for a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly correctly rendered (preentrenamiento, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL). The translation of “fine‑tuning” is inconsistent – first as “optimización” and later as “afinamiento”, while the more common term is “ajuste fino”. This inconsistency reduces precision.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The podcast tone is retained, and cultural references are appropriate. Nevertheless, the mixture of formal “usted” and informal “tú” creates a slight mismatch in register, and the odd insertion of explanatory remarks (e.g., “Camille explica cómo se conecta la salida…”) is unnecessary but not harmful.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the original are present, and no substantive information is lost. Minor issues like the stray word “Tela” and a few redundant parenthetical notes do not affect the core content. The translation is therefore largely complete.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original dialogue and technical concepts well, preserving the educational podcast style. Minor lexical slips, inconsistent terminology, and occasional register mismatches prevent it from being flawless, but the overall message and information are intact. A few edits (fixing the stray word, standardising “fine‑tuning” terminology, and unifying pronoun use) would raise the quality significantly.\nOverall score: 75/100."
