    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logical and the dialogue flow mirrors the original. Minor issues such as the typo “crammar” (should be “aprender a último momento” or similar) and a few missing articles slightly impede smooth comprehension, but overall a Spanish‑speaking reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are occasional literal renderings and awkward phrasing (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto es como crammar”, “ventana de contexto” is acceptable but not the most common term, and the retention of English words like “fine‑tuning” without adaptation). These quirks make the text feel slightly stilted for native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly handled: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje/grounding, y la función de “Memoria”. Consistency is maintained throughout. The only minor point is the occasional use of the English label “fine‑tuning”, which is understandable but could have been fully translated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and explanatory style. Cultural references are neutral and appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only drawback is the aforementioned typo and a few overly literal translations that slightly reduce the natural feel.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and analogies from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No relevant information is omitted, and there is no unnecessary addition. The content remains complete and faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. Readability and completeness are high, and terminology is well‑handled. Fluency suffers from a few awkward phrases and a noticeable typo, which prevent a perfect score. With minor polishing—especially fixing the ‘crammar’ error and smoothing some literal constructions—the translation would be near‑native quality.\n\nFinal total (out of 100): 86/100."
