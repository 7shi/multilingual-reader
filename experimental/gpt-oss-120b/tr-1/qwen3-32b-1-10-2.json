  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the ideas clearly and follows a logical progression. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained in an accessible way. A few sentences are slightly longer than ideal, but overall a Spanish‑speaking reader can understand the whole podcast script without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, but there are a handful of awkward constructions and minor lexical choices: \n- \"El afinamiento… es como enviar a este graduado a seguir una especialización\" (a more natural phrasing would be \"...a una especialización\").\n- Use of \"ancoraje\" (should be \"anclaje\" or \"anclaje\") and occasional missing articles (\"Puedes tomar un modelo experto\" → \"un modelo\").\n- The use of French guillemets « » is uncommon in Spanish publishing, though it does not break fluency. These issues keep the score just below perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well. \"Preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento (fine‑tuning)\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"grounding\" (rendered as \"ancoraje\") are correctly rendered and consistent throughout. The translator could have kept the English loan‑word \"grounding\" in parentheses for extra clarity, but the Spanish equivalents are appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts idioms to Spanish culture (e.g., \"como contratar a un consultor brillante\"). The tone remains informal and podcast‑like, matching the source. Minor cultural mismatches such as the use of guillemets and the slightly literal rendering of \"anchor\" do not significantly affect comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and no unnecessary repetition is introduced. The translation maintains the same length and detail, preserving the educational flow of the episode.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and faithful to the original French podcast script. It successfully transmits the technical explanations and the conversational tone, making the material understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor fluency hiccups and a few lexical choices keep the score just shy of perfection, but they do not impede comprehension. The translation would benefit from slight polishing of phrasing and terminology consistency, yet it is already of high quality and ready for publication with minimal editing."
