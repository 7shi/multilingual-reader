    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are short and the logical flow mirrors the original. The concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained clearly. Minor hiccups such as “Usted lo entendió todo.” and occasional long sentences do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural but contains a few awkward or non‑native constructions. Examples: “Usted lo entendió todo.” (better: “Usted lo ha entendido todo”), “El modelo mismo no aprende…” (better: “El propio modelo no aprende…”), and the retained French word “antisèche”. The term “ancoraje” is not the usual Spanish translation for “grounding” (normally “anclaje”). These issues lower fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely preserved and appropriate: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje (grounding). The only notable deviation is the use of “ancoraje”, a less common variant, and the untranslated “antisèche”. Otherwise the terminology is consistent and correctly applied.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the podcast tone and the explanatory style of the original. It adapts cultural references well, but the lingering French word “antisèche” and the slightly literal rendering of “consultor temporal / experto permanente” could be smoother for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Overall the intent and purpose are well conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major information from the French script is present. No substantive ideas are omitted. The only minor loss is the literal translation of “antisèche”, which is left in French, though the surrounding context makes the meaning clear. Hence a very high completeness score.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does an excellent job of conveying the original content and technical explanations. Readability and terminology are strong, and the information is virtually complete. Fluency and cultural adaptation suffer from a few non‑native expressions and an untranslated French term, which prevent it from reaching a perfect score. With slight polishing—especially replacing “ancoraje” with “anclaje” and translating “antisèche” into a Spanish equivalent—the text would read as fully natural for native speakers."
