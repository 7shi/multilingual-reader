  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the structure of the original dialogue. Most sentences convey the intended meaning, and the technical concepts are explained. However, there are occasional awkward phrasings (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en…”, “el afinado... es ahí donde interviene…”) and overly long sentences that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several non‑native constructions and grammatical slips: incorrect prepositions, gender agreement errors (“estos herramientas”), literal translations that sound odd (“aplastamiento” for “bachotage”), and occasional punctuation issues. While a native speaker could grasp the content, the flow feels stilted.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\" (entrenamiento previo), \"fine‑tuning\" as \"afinado\", \"transfer learning\" as \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL), and \"anclaje\" for grounding. Consistency is good, though the mistranslation of \"bachotage\" as \"aplastamiento\" is inaccurate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue, but it does not fully adapt idiomatic Spanish expressions. Phrases like “¡Hola y bienvenido en…”, “¡Una perfecta analogía!” and the misuse of some verbs reduce cultural naturalness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present; no major ideas are omitted. Minor nuances are slightly altered (e.g., the metaphor for \"bachotage\"), but the overall message remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core content and technical ideas accurately, but it suffers from fluency and naturalness issues that make it feel somewhat literal and occasionally awkward. Technical terminology is well‑handled, yet a few key expressions need better idiomatic adaptation. With some polishing of grammar, word choice, and stylistic flow, the Spanish version would reach a higher level of readability and naturalness.\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 75/100.\nRecommendations: revise prepositional errors, replace \"aplastamiento\" with a more appropriate term like \"memorización\" or \"repaso intensivo\", adjust gender agreements, and smooth out long sentences for better oral‑style flow in a podcast context.\n\nScore: 75"
