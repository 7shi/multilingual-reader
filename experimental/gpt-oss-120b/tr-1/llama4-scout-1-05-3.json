    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the logical flow of the podcast is preserved. However, there are occasional clunky sentences and inconsistent use of formal vs. informal pronouns (e.g., “Usted lo ha entendido todo” vs. “Has entendido todo”). The retained French sentence with a translation note also slightly hinders smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural for a spoken podcast (“Usted lo ha entendido todo”, “Se puede decir eso”, “El afinamiento”). The inclusion of meta‑comments such as “La traducción es:” and the analysis block at the end break the natural flow, making the text feel like a draft rather than a polished script.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, ventana de contexto, grounding, prompt, contexto) are correctly rendered and consistently used. Minor issues like occasional English terms left untranslated do not significantly affect comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally keeps the original intent, but the register shifts and the literal rendering of some phrases (e.g., retaining French with a parenthetical translation) reduce cultural naturalness. The meta‑notes and analysis segment are out of place for a podcast audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the substantive information from the French script is present; no major ideas are omitted. The extra translator’s commentary and analysis do not add to the content and could be considered noise, but they do not cause loss of information.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully conveys the core concepts and technical details of the original podcast, and the terminology is handled well. Nevertheless, the text suffers from awkward phrasing, inconsistent formality, and the inclusion of translator’s meta‑comments that disrupt the natural, conversational tone expected in a podcast. Improving fluency and removing non‑essential notes would raise the overall quality significantly.\nOverall score (out of 100): 75."
