  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text conveys the original ideas clearly. The explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are easy to follow. Minor punctuation quirks (e.g., missing accent in “¿Porque”) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are a few awkward spots: the French loan‑word *antisèche* is left untranslated, occasional pronoun inconsistency (tú/usted), and some slightly stilted phrasing such as “Lo has entendido todo”. These issues prevent a perfect native‑like flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is largely appropriate – *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje por transferencia* are well chosen. The occasional switch to *afinamiento* instead of the established *ajuste fino* and the untranslated *antisèche* slightly weaken consistency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural references are neutral, and the content is adapted well for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor formality shifts (uso de “usted”) are noticeable but do not affect the overall message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is retained. No relevant detail is omitted, and the examples remain intact. The translation is concise without adding unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is very good. It accurately transmits the technical concepts and the conversational style of the podcast, and readers will understand the material without difficulty. The main drawbacks are a few non‑native expressions, inconsistent terminology, and the leftover French term *antisèche*. Addressing these would bring the translation to a near‑perfect level.\n\n**Final average score:** 17.8/20"
