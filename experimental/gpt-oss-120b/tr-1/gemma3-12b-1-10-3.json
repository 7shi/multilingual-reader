    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is riddled with unfinished sentences, stray English fragments, and inserted editorial notes (e.g., \"; verb phrase:\", \"* **issues du pré‑entraînement:**\"). These interruptions break the flow and make it hard for a reader to follow the dialogue. Paragraphs jump abruptly from one idea to another, and the speaker labels are inconsistently rendered. Consequently, a Spanish‑speaking audience would struggle to comprehend the content without constant re‑reading.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation does not read like natural Spanish. It mixes languages, uses literal translations of French idioms, and contains many unnatural constructions such as \"la potencia\" standing alone, \"trabajo de última hora\" inserted without context, and repeated \"Ella lo olvida todo.\" The presence of meta‑linguistic commentary further disrupts fluency. Native speakers would find it awkward and jarring.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, afinación, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL) are present, which is positive. However, many terms are either omitted or inconsistently rendered (e.g., \"ajuste fino\" appears once, then \"afinación\" elsewhere). Some French terms are left untranslated or partially translated, and explanatory paraphrases that were present in the original are lost. Consistency and completeness of terminology are lacking.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original conversational tone of a podcast is largely lost. The translation inserts editorial remarks about translation choices, which would never appear in a real podcast script. Cultural adaptation is minimal; the text does not replace French‑specific references with Spanish‑speaking equivalents, and the occasional use of \"¿Verdad?\" is correct but isolated. Overall, the intent and style of the source are not effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the dialogue are missing or replaced by placeholder text (e.g., \"translation\", \"Luc: ; verb phrase:\", \"Camille: translation\"). Important explanatory passages about in‑context learning, grounding, and memory features are truncated or omitted. The result is a fragmented version that fails to deliver the full information present in the original.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is far from finished. It mixes Spanish, French, and English, contains numerous editorial notes, and omits substantial content from the source. While some technical vocabulary is correctly transferred, the overall readability, fluency, and fidelity to the original podcast script are extremely low. A thorough rewrite is required, removing meta‑comments, completing the missing dialogue, and adapting the conversational style to natural Spanish.\n\n**Suggested actions:**\n1. Remove all editorial annotations and placeholder text.\n2. Complete the missing sentences, ensuring each speaker’s line mirrors the original meaning.\n3. Use consistent Spanish terminology for AI concepts (e.g., \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\").\n4. Preserve the podcast’s informal, explanatory tone, adding natural interjections where appropriate.\n5. Verify that all key ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features) are fully represented.\n\nOnly after a comprehensive revision will the translation be usable for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
