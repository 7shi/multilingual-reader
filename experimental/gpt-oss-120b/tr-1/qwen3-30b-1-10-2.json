  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are broken appropriately and complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained with clear analogías. The flow mirrors the original French script, making it comprehensible for a non‑expert audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for native Spanish speakers. Most expressions are idiomatic (\"es como contratar a un consultor brillante\", \"estudiar de última hora\"), and the grammar is correct. Minor awkwardness appears in \"consultor temporario\" (more common would be \"consultor temporal\"), but it does not break fluency.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are all rendered correctly. When a term could be unfamiliar, the translator keeps the original English acronym in parentheses, preserving clarity.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references and colloquialisms appropriately for Spanish‑speaking listeners. The analogy of a \"consultor\" and the use of \"bachotaje\" (studying at the last minute) fit well. Only a small tweak could improve the phrase \"funciones de memorización\" to \"funcionalidad de Memoria\", but the intent is preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is retained. No key points are omitted, and the logical progression of ideas remains intact. The translator even preserved the structure of the dialogue, ensuring the podcast format is clear.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, uses natural Spanish, and keeps the conversational tone of the podcast. Minor lexical choices (e.g., \"consultor temporario\") could be refined, but they do not detract from overall comprehension. The work succeeds in making the French source fully accessible to Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.8 ≈ 19/20.\n\nScore: 19"
