  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version flows logically and the complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory) are explained clearly with good analogies. Sentence structures are simple enough for a broad audience while preserving the original depth. Minor hiccups (e.g., a slightly clunky phrasing in one sentence) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for native Spanish speakers. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary (e.g., “bachoteo”, “chuleta”). A few constructions feel a bit stiff (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje”), but overall the text sounds smooth and idiomatic.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently handled: «preentrenamiento», «afinamiento», «aprendizaje por transferencia», «ventana de contexto», «aprendizaje en contexto», «anclaje», «memoria». The translator kept the original English acronyms (ICL) and provided Spanish equivalents where needed, which is ideal for the target audience.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., “consultor brillante” instead of “consultant”). The examples are equally clear for Spanish‑speaking listeners, and the tone of a podcast dialogue is preserved.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted, and no redundant material is added. The translation conveys the same logical progression and examples.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It faithfully reproduces the original content, uses correct technical terminology, and is easily understandable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but they do not detract from the overall effectiveness.\nOverall score (average): 19.2/20, rounded to 19/20.\nOverall rating: 19/20"
