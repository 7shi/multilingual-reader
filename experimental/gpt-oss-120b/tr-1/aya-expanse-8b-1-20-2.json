    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly short and the logical flow mirrors the original. A few minor quirks (e.g., \"el preentrenamiento\" without capitalization, occasional redundant clauses) do not impede comprehension, but they slightly affect smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are noticeable native‑speaker errors: \"Tela es la realidad del ICL\" (likely a typo for \"Esa\"), \"subes al caballo\" instead of the bicycle metaphor, and the use of \"optimización\" for fine‑tuning, which feels unnatural. Overall the text is understandable but not fully natural.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are correctly rendered. The translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"optimización\" is less precise, and \"grounding\" is rendered as \"anclaje\", which is acceptable but could be clarified. Consistency is mostly maintained.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original podcast are preserved. Cultural references are largely appropriate, though the \"caballo\" metaphor is a mismatch for the bicycle analogy, and the brand name \"Tech Éclair\" becomes \"Tech Rápido\", which is a reasonable adaptation. Minor mismatches lower the score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of the new \"Memory\" feature. No substantive information is omitted, and the added bracketed summary does not introduce errors.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and retains the conversational style of the podcast. However, a handful of typographical errors, slightly awkward phrasing, and a few less‑than‑ideal term choices prevent it from being fully natural for a native Spanish audience. A light proof‑read and a few terminology adjustments would bring it to a higher level of polish.\n\nOverall, the work is solid and informative but requires minor polishing for fluency and idiomatic precision.\n\nOverall score (out of 20): 16\n\n---\n**Detailed Reasoning**\n- **Readability (16/20)** – Clear structure, minor quirks.\n- **Fluency (14/20)** – Typos and unnatural idioms affect natural flow.\n- **Terminology (15/20)** – Mostly correct, but \"optimización\" for fine‑tuning is sub‑optimal.\n- **Contextual Adaptation (15/20)** – Intent preserved; occasional metaphor mismatch.\n- **Information Completeness (18/20)** – No loss of content, all concepts retained.\n\nThe averaged score yields a final rating of **16/20**."
