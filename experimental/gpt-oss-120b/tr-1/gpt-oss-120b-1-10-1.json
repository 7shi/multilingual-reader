  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the sentences are clear. Complex ideas are explained in an accessible way, and the structure mirrors the original. Minor issues such as occasional long sentences do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for native speakers. Vocabulary is appropriate and colloquial touches like \"chuleta\" add authenticity. A few phrases (e.g., \"Vea, por ejemplo:\" and \"una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\") are slightly formal or clunky, preventing a perfect score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: preentrenamiento, afinamiento (fine‑tuning), aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding → anclaje, etc. The term \"prompt\" is left untranslated, which is acceptable in current AI discourse. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original tone to Spanish‑speaking listeners, using idiomatic expressions and culturally neutral references. The metaphor of a \"consultor brillante\" works well, and the informal \"chuleta\" fits the casual podcast style.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is retained. No important detail is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, this is a high‑quality translation. The content is faithful, terminology is accurate, and the text is readable and largely natural. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but the translation effectively conveys the original podcast script to a Spanish‑speaking audience.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.4 → 18/20."
