  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original flow, allowing readers to grasp the main ideas. However, several sentences are overly long or oddly punctuated, and occasional grammatical slips (e.g., \"las conocimientos\") slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are multiple unnatural expressions and register mismatches for a podcast script: \"Usted ha entendido todo\", \"el afinado\", \"antiespuesta\", and the mix of formal \"Usted\" with a conversational tone. These choices make the translation feel stilted and not fully native‑speaker‑like.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly preserved (preentrenamiento, ventana de contexto, ICL), but some are translated inconsistently or with sub‑optimal equivalents (\"afinado\" instead of \"ajuste fino\", \"anclaje\" for \"grounding\"). The translation does not always provide clarifying paraphrases where needed, though the meaning remains recognizable.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original French podcast is informal; the Spanish version retains a formal \"Usted\" register and literal phrasing, which does not align with typical Spanish podcast speech. Cultural nuances (e.g., idiomatic ways to refer to a \"cheat sheet\") are missed, reducing the adaptation quality.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present; no substantial content is omitted. Minor inaccuracies (e.g., \"antiespuesta\" for \"cheat sheet\") and grammatical errors do not lead to loss of essential information, so completeness is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning accurately, but the language feels overly formal and contains several awkward phrasing choices that reduce naturalness. Technical terminology is mostly correct but could be standardized, and some idiomatic expressions need refinement to match a conversational Spanish podcast style. Overall, the translation is functional but would benefit from a more native‑speaker review to improve fluency and cultural adaptation.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14/20."
