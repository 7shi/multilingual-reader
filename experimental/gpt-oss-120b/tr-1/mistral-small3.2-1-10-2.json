  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text conveys the original ideas and the logical flow of the conversation is mostly preserved. However, duplicated speaker tags (e.g., \"Camille: Camille:\" and \"Luc: Luc:\") and occasional typographical errors (e.g., \"preentrenamiento\" instead of \"pre‑entrenamiento\") interrupt the reading flow and can confuse the reader. Apart from those glitches, sentences are generally clear and the complex concepts are explained in an understandable way.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, using appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic expressions. There are a few awkward constructions such as \"es del bachotaje\" and the redundant \"Luc: Luc:\" which feel unnatural to a native speaker. Minor punctuation issues also affect smoothness. Overall, the text is fluent but not polished.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", etc. The translator kept consistency throughout and used the standard Spanish equivalents. No major mistranslations of terminology were observed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately. The explanations are kept at a level suitable for a general‑audience podcast. Minor issues like the redundant speaker labels slightly affect the adaptation, but overall the message is conveyed effectively for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the essential information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No key points are omitted, and the technical explanations remain intact. The only drawback is the presence of duplicated labels, which does not delete information but adds noise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid in terms of content fidelity and technical terminology. It succeeds in delivering the podcast’s explanations in clear Spanish. The main weaknesses are formatting errors (duplicate speaker tags) and a few slightly awkward phrasing choices, which lower readability and fluency. With a cleanup of the formatting and minor stylistic tweaks, the translation would be of high quality.\n\nOverall score (average): 16.4/20."
