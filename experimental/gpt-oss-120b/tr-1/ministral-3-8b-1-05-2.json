  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is fragmented and contains many unfinished sentences, stray English words, and placeholders (e.g., \"Pre‑training\", \"we\", \"formation de plusieurs années\", \"anchoring\", \"memory\"). The reader has to guess missing parts, which makes the flow confusing and difficult to follow.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are numerous unnatural constructions (\"She forgets everything\" left in English, \"It is\" without continuation, \"the big question\"), abrupt line breaks, and a mixture of Spanish, English and French. The Spanish that is present is often literal and stilted, not sounding like natural spoken Spanish.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly translated, but many key terms remain in English (\"Pre‑training\", \"ICL\", \"grounding\", \"memory\") or are omitted. Consistency is lacking, and there is no effort to explain the terms for a non‑technical audience.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation does not preserve the original podcast tone. It mixes languages, leaves meta‑comments, and fails to adapt cultural references. The intent of a friendly, explanatory dialogue is lost, making the adaptation ineffective.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are missing or truncated (e.g., Luc's description of pre‑training, the analogy about consultants, the final farewell). Important explanations are omitted, and placeholders replace real content, resulting in loss of information.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is far from complete or usable. It mixes languages, contains many unfinished sentences and placeholder notes, and omits substantial parts of the original script. While some technical terminology is correctly rendered, the overall readability, fluency, and fidelity to the source are very low. A thorough, line‑by‑line rewrite is required to produce a coherent, natural Spanish version of the podcast dialogue."
