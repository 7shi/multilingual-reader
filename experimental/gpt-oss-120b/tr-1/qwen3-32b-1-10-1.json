  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear order. Sentences are generally short enough for easy comprehension, and complex concepts are explained with suitable examples. Minor hiccups (e.g., “Vea:” instead of a smoother connector) do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, and the dialogue style is preserved. A few expressions feel slightly stiff or literal – “ancoraje” (more common would be “anclaje”), “Vea:” as an isolated imperative, and occasional anglicisms left untranslated – but these are isolated and do not break fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL*, etc. The explanation of “grounding” as “ancoraje” is understandable, though “anclaje” would be more idiomatic. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original intent well for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogy of a consultant is preserved. Minor issues such as the colloquial “bachotaje” could be refined, but the overall message is conveyed effectively.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present. No significant content is omitted, and the explanatory details (e.g., how “memoria” works) are kept. The only slight loss is the nuance of the word “grounding,” which is rendered as “ancoraje” without additional clarification.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality, preserving the structure, tone, and technical depth of the original podcast script. Readability and technical accuracy are strong, with only a few minor phrasing choices that could be smoother. Overall, it delivers the content clearly and naturally to a Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\n**Strengths**: faithful terminology, clear explanations, good retention of original meaning.\n**Areas for improvement**: adjust a couple of literal translations (e.g., “ancoraje”, “Vea:”) and consider slightly more idiomatic phrasing for a smoother read.\n\n**Overall score**: 18/20."
