  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow and the complex ideas are explained clearly. Sentence structures are generally logical, though a few long sentences could be split for smoother reading. Overall a reader would understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part and uses appropriate vocabulary. There are a handful of slightly awkward phrases (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto es como estudiar intensamente para un examen” and “el modelo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus conversaciones”) that native speakers might phrase differently, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and “grounding” are correctly rendered and consistently used. The translator kept the original English acronym ICL and provided a clear Spanish explanation, which is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast tone and intent, adapting idiomatic French expressions into natural Spanish equivalents. Cultural references are neutral, and the speaker voices remain distinct. Minor adjustments could improve flow, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No relevant detail is omitted, and no unnecessary redundancy is introduced. The translation remains faithful to the original content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical concepts accurately and maintains the conversational style of the podcast. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency could be polished slightly to eliminate a few stiff constructions. The translation is complete and well‑adapted to a Spanish‑speaking audience, making it a reliable rendering of the original French script."
