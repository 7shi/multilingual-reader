  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the logical flow of the dialogue is preserved. Most sentences are clear, and the complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained in an accessible way. A few literal renderings such as “proceso llamado « pré‑entraînement »” and “proceso bien verdadero” slightly hinder immediate comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, but there are occasional awkward phrases that betray a literal French‑to‑Spanish conversion (e.g., “bien verdadero”, “vinculación” for grounding, retaining French terms in quotes). Native speakers would notice these as slightly stilted, though they do not break the flow.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is handled correctly: “ajuste fino” for fine‑tuning, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and the abbreviation ICL are all appropriate. Consistency is maintained throughout. The only minor point is the choice of “vinculación” for grounding, which is acceptable but less common than “anclaje” or “contextualización”.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and conversational style. Cultural references are neutral, so no adaptation is required. Minor improvements could be made to idiomatic phrasing, but the target audience receives the same message as in the French version.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original script is present; no substantive content is omitted or added. Even the nuanced explanation of “memoria” features is retained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. It excels in completeness and accurate use of terminology. Fluency and readability suffer from a handful of literal translations and slightly odd phrasing, but these do not impede understanding. Minor lexical tweaks would bring the text to a near‑native level.\n\nStrengths: faithful content, correct technical terms, clear structure. Weaknesses: occasional literal renderings, some non‑idiomatic expressions.\n\nThe translation is ready for a knowledgeable Spanish‑speaking audience, though a final proofreading pass for naturalness would be beneficial.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 17.2/20, rounded to 17/20."
