  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally clear and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences are understandable, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in plain language. A few long sentences could be split for easier reading, but overall a Spanish‑speaking listener can follow the podcast script without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds mostly natural, but there are occasional awkward constructions and inconsistent registers (e.g., \"Ustedes han comprendido todo\" vs. \"cuando abres una nueva ventana\"). Some minor stylistic choices (\"forma astuta\", \"bambalinas\") feel slightly forced. Nevertheless, the wording is fluent enough for native speakers and does not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\" and \"grounding\" are all translated or kept consistently. The translation respects the level of the audience and provides the appropriate Spanish equivalents where needed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using idiomatic expressions and culturally neutral language. Minor issues remain with register consistency, but the intent, tone and educational purpose of the original are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is retained. No relevant detail is omitted, and no superfluous content is added. The translation faithfully mirrors the structure and content of the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical concepts accurately, maintains the educational tone of the podcast, and is largely readable and natural for Spanish listeners. Small improvements could be made in register consistency and sentence smoothing, but these do not detract significantly from the effectiveness of the translation.\n\nFinal overall rating (average of the five criteria): 17.6 ≈ 18/20."
