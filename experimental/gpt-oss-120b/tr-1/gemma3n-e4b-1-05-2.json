  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. Sentence structures are logical, but there are a few hiccups (e.g., the fragment “funciones de memorización” and occasional missing verbs) that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but some expressions feel literal or awkward (e.g., “funciones de memorización” without a verb, “una libreta de apuntes” is acceptable but a bit informal, and occasional missing punctuation). Overall it is understandable to a native speaker, but not perfectly polished.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “anclaje”, and the English acronyms are retained appropriately. The only minor point is the mix of English “fine‑tuning” without translation, which is acceptable in a technical context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts cultural references suitably (e.g., “consultor brillante”, “libreta de apuntes”). Minor issues such as the missing verb fragment do not alter the overall meaning, but they slightly reduce the adaptation quality.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All main ideas from the French script are present. The only loss is the incomplete sentence after “¿Es una astucia?” where the translation cuts off, which could cause a tiny gap in the flow. No major information is omitted.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and is largely readable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. It captures the nuances of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning well. Minor grammatical slips and a fragmented sentence prevent it from being flawless, but overall it is a solid, functional translation.\n\nStrengths: correct terminology, faithful conveyance of concepts, appropriate cultural adaptations. Weaknesses: occasional awkward phrasing, a missing verb fragment, and a slight loss of fluency in a few places.\n\nOverall, the work is good and only needs a light proofreading pass to smooth out the minor errors.\n\nScore: 16/20 (average of the five evaluated criteria)."
