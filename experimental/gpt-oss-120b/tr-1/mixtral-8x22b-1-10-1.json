    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow and conveys the concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning clearly. Sentence structures are mostly logical and the dialogue format is preserved. Minor issues – such as the untranslated French interjection \"D'accord.\" and the inconsistent use of the podcast name – cause a brief pause for the reader, but they do not break overall comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds generally natural, using appropriate Spanish phrasing and idioms. There are a few awkward spots (e.g., \"Olvídalo todo\" for \"She forgets everything\", \"Tal es la realidad\" instead of a more idiomatic \"Así es la realidad\"), and the sudden switch from \"TecnoClaridad\" back to the original French title \"Tech Éclair\" feels jarring. Overall, a native speaker would understand it, but the flow is not perfectly smooth.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled excellently. \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"grounding\" are translated or kept consistently. The translator also adds clarifying parentheticals where needed, maintaining consistency throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content well to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using familiar expressions and maintaining the educational tone. However, the change of the podcast title to \"TecnoClaridad\" (and later reverting to \"Tech Éclair\") introduces inconsistency, and the French phrase \"D'accord\" is left untranslated, which detracts from full cultural adaptation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the substantive information from the original French script is retained: the explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the notion of temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the description of the \"memory\" feature. The only loss is the untranslated \"D'accord\" which is a tiny omission, and the title inconsistency, but no major content is omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. It demonstrates a good grasp of the subject matter and uses appropriate terminology. Minor lapses—an untranslated French interjection, inconsistent podcast naming, and a few slightly unnatural phrasings—prevent it from being perfect, but overall it is a high‑quality translation that would be readily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners."
