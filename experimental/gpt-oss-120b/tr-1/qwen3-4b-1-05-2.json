    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow; the main ideas about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are conveyed clearly. However, there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., \"¡Hola y bienvenida en…\", \"conocencias\", \"afinan\") that slightly hinder smooth comprehension, especially for readers unfamiliar with the original French.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, but several grammatical slips and unnatural phrasing appear. \"¡Hola y bienvenida en\" should be \"¡Hola y bienvenidos a\", and \"conocencias\" is a non‑standard word. Some sentences feel literal translations of French structures, which a native Spanish speaker would phrase differently. Overall the text is understandable but not fully idiomatic.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: \"entrenamiento previo\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"grounding\" rendered as \"anclaje\" are appropriate and consistent. The word \"prompt\" is left untranslated, which is acceptable in current AI jargon. Minor inconsistencies (e.g., \"afinan\" instead of \"afinan\") do not affect technical meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose of the podcast. Cultural adaptation is mostly adequate, though the opening greeting could be smoother for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The analogy of a consultant and the discussion of memory features remain clear and relevant.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and the pseudo‑memory feature are intact. Minor typographical errors (\"conocencias\", \"afinan\") do not lead to loss of information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully conveys the technical content of the podcast and retains the educational tone. Strengths include accurate handling of specialized terminology and thorough coverage of the original material. Weaknesses lie mainly in occasional grammatical slips and slightly unnatural phrasing, which prevent the text from feeling completely native. With a few edits to improve fluency and correct minor errors, the translation would be excellent for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\nOverall score (sum of the five criteria): 81/100, which corresponds to a solid 16‑17 out of 20 on average. The work is commendable, but a final proofreading pass is recommended to polish the language.\n\nScore: 81"
