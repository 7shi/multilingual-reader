    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original logical flow. Most sentences are clear, but a few awkward phrasings (e.g., “cramar”) slightly hinder comprehension.",

    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are noticeable errors and odd word choices such as “es cramar”, “fundamento” for grounding, and occasional missing accents. These reduce the smoothness for native speakers.",

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, fine‑tuning (ajuste fino), ICL, ventana de contexto, etc. The only minor inconsistency is the translation of “grounding” as “fundamento” instead of a more common “anclaje”.",

    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The podcast tone and cultural references are preserved. The translator adapts the consultant analogy well (“consultor”). Minor lexical slips (e.g., “cramar”) slightly affect the adaptation, but overall the intent is conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the original script are present; no major information is omitted. The translation even keeps parenthetical explanations. Only negligible loss of nuance in the grounding term.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation does a solid job of transmitting the content and technical concepts of the original French podcast into Spanish. Readability and terminology are strong, and the information is complete. However, fluency suffers from a few typographical and lexical errors that make some sentences sound unnatural. A revision of the problematic phrases would raise the quality to near‑native level.\n\nStrengths: accurate technical terminology, faithful content transfer, appropriate tone.\nWeaknesses: occasional mistranslations/typos (e.g., “cramar”), inconsistent choice for “grounding”, minor punctuation/accent issues.\nThe translation is functional and suitable for an informed audience, but it needs polishing for a polished, native‑speaker experience.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 16/20."
