  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is frequently interrupted by untranslated placeholders (e.g., \"Camille: previous\", \"Luc: previous\", \"Camille: grounding\", \"Luc: It is\", \"Camille: Memory\", \"Luc: memory\"). There are also meta‑annotations such as \"**Traducción al español:**\" that break the narrative flow. Because of these interruptions a Spanish‑speaking reader would have to guess missing parts, making the script hard to follow.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Where the translation is present, the language is generally smooth and natural (e.g., \"Es como contratar a un consultor brillante...\"). However, the presence of English fragments, literal translations, and the meta‑notes creates an awkward, non‑fluid reading experience. Some sentences are overly literal (e.g., \"una memoria a corto plazo\" instead of \"memoria a corto plazo\") but still understandable. The overall fluency is therefore limited.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\", \"grounding\", \"memoria\". In a few places the English terms are left unchanged (e.g., \"memory\", \"grounding\") or are presented as headings, which can be confusing. No consistent glossary is provided, but the core terminology is largely appropriate.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally preserves the original intent and tone (technical, explanatory, collaborative). Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is needed. Nevertheless, the numerous placeholders and stray English words diminish the effectiveness of conveying the original message to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Significant portions of the original dialogue are missing or replaced by placeholders. Meta‑comments and the “Traducción al español:” brackets add information that was not in the source, while many lines from the original (e.g., the initial exchange about \"pré‑entraînement\", the exact wording of Camille’s “D’accord”, etc.) are omitted. Hence the translation is incomplete.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures many of the technical concepts correctly, but it is marred by numerous untranslated placeholders, meta‑annotations, and occasional English fragments. These artifacts interrupt readability, fluency, and completeness, making the script unsuitable for direct publication without thorough editing and cleanup. A revised version should remove all placeholder text, integrate the meta‑notes into the flow (or omit them), and ensure every original line is rendered in Spanish.\n\nOverall, the translation demonstrates an understanding of the subject matter but fails in execution due to editorial oversights.\n\n**Overall score (sum of criteria): 45 / 100**\n\n**Suggested actions:**\n1. Remove all placeholder lines (e.g., \"previous\", \"grounding\", \"memory\").\n2. Eliminate the \"**Traducción al español:**\" brackets; simply provide the Spanish dialogue.\n3. Ensure every French line has a corresponding Spanish translation.\n4. Perform a final proofread for naturalness and consistency of terminology.\n5. Optionally add a brief glossary for terms like \"ICL\" and \"grounding\" if the target audience is non‑expert.\n\nAfter these corrections, the translation would be much more usable.\n\n**Final rating:** 45/100."
