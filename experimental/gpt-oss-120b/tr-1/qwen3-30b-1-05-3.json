  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. Sentence structures are logical, and the dialogue format helps comprehension. Minor issues such as occasional overly literal phrasing (e.g., “pre‑entrenamiento” instead of the more common “preentrenamiento”) do not significantly impede understanding.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward or non‑idiomatic expressions: “Miren:” is informal for a podcast script, the word “antisèche” is left in French, and the switch between “anclaje” and “fundamentación” for “grounding” is inconsistent. These hiccups prevent a fully smooth reading experience for native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”, and “prompt” are appropriate. However, the inconsistent translation of “grounding” and the retention of the French word “antisèche” detract from term consistency. Overall, terminology is adequate but not perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts the content for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are minimal, so no major adaptation is needed. The few remaining French loanwords and the slightly colloquial “Miren:” slightly reduce cultural fit, but the overall message remains intact.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No relevant detail is omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue. Minor stylistic repetitions could be trimmed, but the content is complete and accurate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job conveying the technical discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning. It is readable and complete, but fluency is marred by a few non‑idiomatic choices and inconsistent handling of specific terms (especially “grounding” and the stray French word “antisèche”). With slight polishing—standardising terminology, removing French loanwords, and smoothing colloquial interjections—the text would read as a fully natural Spanish podcast script.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
