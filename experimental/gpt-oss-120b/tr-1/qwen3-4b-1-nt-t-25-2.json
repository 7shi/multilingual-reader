  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable. Sentences follow the original structure and the concepts are explained clearly. A few minor errors (e.g., “bienvenido en” instead of “bienvenido a”, missing article before “preentrenamiento”) slightly impede smooth reading, but they do not block comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several awkward or unidiomatic expressions appear: “bienvenido en”, “con con muy poca información”, “es del 'bachotage'”, and the mix of formal “usted” with a conversational podcast tone. These reduce the natural flow for native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as preentrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, and anclaje are correctly retained. However, occasional inconsistencies appear – the French word “bachotage” is left untranslated, “prompt” is misspelled as “promp”, and “poser” remains French. Overall the terminology is adequate but not perfectly handled.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and explanatory style, but literal renderings and residual French words (e.g., “poser”) show insufficient cultural adaptation. The formal “usted” is acceptable, yet the overall tone could be smoother for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are present. No substantive information is omitted, and the logical progression is kept. Minor typographical duplications (\"con con\") and slight wording glitches do not cause loss of meaning.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core content accurately and is mostly readable, but it suffers from several linguistic slips, unidiomatic phrasing, and occasional leftover French terms. A careful proofread and some stylistic adjustments would raise its fluency and cultural appropriateness considerably. The technical terminology is handled well overall, and no key information is missing, which makes the translation functional despite its rough edges.\nOverall score: 75/100."
