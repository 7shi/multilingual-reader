    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version mixes dialogue, meta‑comments, placeholders (e.g., \"previous\", \"You\", \"Memory\"), and English fragments. The formatting is erratic, with bracketed notes that interrupt the flow. A native reader would have to pause repeatedly to decipher what is dialogue and what is annotation, making the text hard to follow.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Numerous literal translations (“ventana de contexto”, “memoria a uso único”) sound stiff, and many sentences are unidiomatic (e.g., \"Es como contratar a un consultor brillante y, en lugar de enviarlo a un plan de formación de varios años, simplemente entregarle los documentos exactos que necesita para el proyecto actual.\"). English words remain (\"grounding\", \"ICL\", \"memory\") and there are abrupt capitalisations, indicating a lack of natural Spanish flow.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly rendered. However, other terms are inconsistently handled: \"grounding\" stays in English, \"ICL\" is not explained, and the placeholder \"previous\" is meaningless. The translation does not consistently provide the necessary explanations for a non‑expert audience.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent—to explain AI learning mechanisms in a conversational podcast style—is obscured by the insertion of explanatory side‑notes and untranslated English words. Cultural references are preserved, but the overall adaptation is weak because the reader is constantly pulled out of the narrative by the meta‑information.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several portions of the original dialogue are lost or garbled: lines labelled \"previous\" and \"You\" contain no content, and some explanatory sentences are replaced by placeholders. While most core concepts appear, the loss of concrete phrasing and the presence of extraneous notes reduce completeness.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation attempts to preserve the technical content but falls short due to numerous formatting artefacts, untranslated English terms, and inserted meta‑comments that break readability. A thorough rewrite is needed: remove placeholders, integrate explanatory notes smoothly, ensure all English words are translated or explained, and polish the Spanish prose to sound natural and fluid for podcast listeners. As it stands, the text would be confusing for the target audience and does not meet a professional translation standard."
