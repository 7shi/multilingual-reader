  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation conveys the ideas clearly and the sentences follow a logical order. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can grasp. A few minor phrasing choices (e.g., \"parte de un contexto vacío\") are slightly awkward but do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the text sounds natural, but there are occasional literal translations that feel stiff: \"Vea:\" for \"Voyez\", \"ancoraje\" (should be \"anclaje\"), and mixed use of \"tú\"/\"usted\". The vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, yet the small awkward spots prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" are all correctly rendered. The term \"grounding\" is translated as \"ancoraje\", which is not the standard Spanish term (\"anclaje\" or \"vinculación\"). The English word \"prompt\" is kept, which is acceptable in a technical context. Consistency is otherwise good.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the podcast format and keeps the conversational tone. Cultural references are neutral, and the speaker’s roles are preserved. Minor issues such as the literal “Vea:” and the non‑standard \"ancoraje\" slightly affect adaptation, but the overall intent and purpose are fully conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No sentences or ideas are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The content remains concise and accurate.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and generally easy to understand. It captures the technical content and the podcast’s conversational style well. A few literal translations and the unconventional choice of \"ancoraje\" are the main detractors, but they do not significantly impair the reader’s experience. With minor polishing, the text would read like a native‑written Spanish podcast script.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 89/100."
