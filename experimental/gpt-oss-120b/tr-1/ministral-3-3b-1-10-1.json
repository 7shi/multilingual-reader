    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is riddled with incomplete sentences, abrupt line breaks, and interspersed translation‑process notes (e.g., “(the next step was …)”, “**Justification for final translation choices**). These fragments make it very hard for a Spanish‑speaking reader to follow the dialogue. The logical flow of the original podcast is lost, and many speaker turns are unintelligible.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish sounds unnatural: there are literal translations, gender/number mismatches (e.g., “las nuevas conocimientos”), mixed English fragments, and occasional literal retention of French syntax. Phrases such as “Exactamente, el aprendizaje por transferencia es la clave. Por ejemplo, no enseñarías…” are acceptable, but the surrounding text breaks the natural rhythm. Overall the passage feels like a draft rather than a polished script.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally recognizable (\"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"memoria a corto plazo\"). However, their usage is inconsistent (e.g., \"afinado\" vs. the more common \"ajuste fino\"), and some translations are awkward (“las nuevas conocimientos”). No consistent glossary is applied, and occasional English words remain untranslated.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation does not fully adapt the original conversational tone to Spanish‑speaking audiences. Cultural references are left untouched, and explanatory footnotes appear in the middle of the dialogue, breaking immersion. The intent of the speakers is often obscured by the inserted meta‑comments, so the adaptation is insufficient.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A significant portion of the original content is missing or truncated. Several speaker lines are cut off (e.g., “Camille: re‑”, “Luc: you can take”), and large blocks of the original explanation are replaced by translation notes rather than the actual dialogue. While the core ideas appear in places, the overall completeness is low.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is far from publishable. It mixes the actual translated dialogue with extensive meta‑annotations, resulting in poor readability, low fluency, and gaps in information. Technical terminology is partially correct but inconsistently applied. To reach an acceptable level, the translator should produce a clean, continuous Spanish script, remove all editorial notes, ensure consistent terminology (e.g., \"ajuste fino\" instead of \"afinado\"), and verify that every line from the original podcast is present and correctly rendered.\n\nIn short, the current version would require a complete rewrite and thorough editing before it could be used for a Spanish‑language podcast episode."
