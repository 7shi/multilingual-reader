    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the flow of ideas follows the original podcast script. However, there are several awkward constructions (e.g., “las informaciones necesarias”, “Voyez plutôt:”, “el ajuste fino” used inconsistently) and occasional French remnants that can momentarily confuse the reader. These issues lower the ease of comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound natural, but a number of literal translations and French‑Spanish code‑switches make the prose feel stilted. Phrases like “las informaciones” (instead of “la información”), the untranslated French “Voyez plutôt:” and the unusual abbreviation “AIC (Aprendizaje In-Contexto)” break the native‑speaker flow.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto* and *grounding* (rendered as “anclaje”) are correctly rendered and consistently used. The only notable issue is the change of the original acronym ICL to AIC, which could mislead readers familiar with the literature.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the informal podcast tone and adapts cultural references (e.g., “consultor brillante”) appropriately. Nevertheless, remnants of French punctuation and phrasing, plus the occasional overly literal rendering, prevent a fully smooth adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the substantive information from the French source is present; no major ideas are omitted. The inserted meta‑comment about Camille’s summary is extraneous but does not delete content. The change of the acronym (ICL → AIC) is a minor deviation, but overall the content remains complete.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original message accurately and preserves most of the technical detail. It is functional and mostly clear, yet it suffers from several literal leftovers, inconsistent terminology (the ICL→AIC switch) and occasional unidiomatic phrasing that affect readability and fluency. A careful revision to remove French fragments, correct plural noun usage, and keep the original acronym would raise the quality significantly.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 14/20.\n\nScore: 14"
