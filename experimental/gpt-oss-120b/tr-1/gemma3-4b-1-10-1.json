    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the main ideas are conveyed, but there are several interruptions (e.g., \"Camille: suelen\", an incomplete sentence \"Cuando abre una nueva ventana\") and some literal translations that make the flow harder for a native reader. The sentence structure is mostly logical, yet occasional fragments break comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural: \"el afinamiento\" for fine‑tuning, \"suelen\" standing alone, and awkward phrasing such as \"El conocimiento que le proporcionas en el prompt es temporal\" (the word *prompt* is left in English). The presence of editorial comments (//Alternative…) further reduces naturalness. Overall the translation does not read as smooth native Spanish.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *grounding* rendered as \"anclaje\". However, consistency is lacking (sometimes \"afinamiento\", sometimes \"ajuste fino\"). Acronym ICL is kept without explanation, which is acceptable for the target audience. The terminology is adequate but not perfectly uniform.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and the podcast‑style dialogue. Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is required. Nevertheless, some literal translations (e.g., \"consultor brillante\") feel slightly stiff, and the inclusion of translation‑process notes in the body distracts from the target audience’s experience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present, but a few fragments are cut off (\"Cuando abre una nueva ventana\" ends abruptly) and translation‑process comments appear in the final text, which are not part of the original content. Thus, while the core information is mostly retained, completeness is imperfect.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the core technical explanations and maintains the dialogue format, but it suffers from several readability and fluency issues, including stray editorial notes, incomplete sentences, and some unnatural lexical choices. Terminology is largely correct, yet consistency could be improved. Overall, the text is understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience with a technical background, but it would benefit from thorough editing to remove artifacts and polish the language.\n\nScore (average of criteria): 13.8 ≈ 14/20."
