  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are short and the logical flow mirrors the original. However, the frequent use of opening exclamation marks combined with periods (e.g., \"¡Exacto.\") creates slight visual clutter, which can momentarily hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward constructions and punctuation errors. Phrases such as \"¡El preentrenamiento.\" and the over‑use of \"¡Exacto.\" with a period feel un‑Spanish. Some verb choices (e.g., \"el afinar\" instead of \"el afinamiento\") are less idiomatic. These issues lower the overall fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved (preentrenamiento, ICL, ventana de contexto, afinamiento). Nevertheless, the translation introduces a typo – \"anchora\" instead of the correct \"anclaje\" or \"ancoraje\" – and keeps the English word \"grounding\" in quotes, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the term. Consistency is acceptable but not perfect.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent, tone, and educational purpose of the original podcast are well conveyed. Cultural references are neutral, and the Spanish version uses appropriate register for a tech‑focused audience. Minor phrasing issues do not affect the overall message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are present: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, la diferencia entre memoria temporal y permanente, y la explicación de las funciones de \"Memoria\". No significant information is omitted, and the translation stays concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation faithfully transmits the original content and maintains the educational tone, but it is marred by punctuation inconsistencies, a few non‑idiomatic expressions, and a typo in a technical term. These issues prevent it from achieving a fully natural, native‑speaker quality.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20.\nScore: 16"
