  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure, but several awkward constructions (e.g., “El afinado”, “El aprendizaje en contexto, es aprendizaje superficial”, “Simply utiliza”) slightly hinder smooth comprehension. Overall, a native reader can follow the discussion without major difficulty.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are multiple unnatural expressions and occasional mix‑language errors (e.g., “Simply utiliza”, “sueña con los detalles”). Punctuation errors and unnecessary commas also affect flow. The translation sounds mostly natural but still feels a bit mechanical.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”. However, “fine‑tuning” is rendered as “el afinado”, which is not the usual Spanish term (preferible: “ajuste fino”). The word “prompt” is left untranslated, which is acceptable in a technical context. Overall terminology is adequate but not optimal.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, and the examples (consultor brillante, bicicleta) are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor mistakes like “sueña con los detalles” (should be “se acuerda”) slightly distort the nuance, but the overall message remains clear.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas, examples, and explanations from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is omitted, and the logical progression of the podcast script is retained. Minor typographical issues do not affect completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the content and technical concepts of the original podcast fairly well. Readability and terminology are solid, but fluency suffers from several awkward phrases and occasional English intrusions. Terminology could be refined (e.g., using “ajuste fino” for fine‑tuning). Despite these issues, the Spanish version is comprehensible and faithful to the source.\n\n**Overall Score:** 15/20 (average of the five criteria)."
