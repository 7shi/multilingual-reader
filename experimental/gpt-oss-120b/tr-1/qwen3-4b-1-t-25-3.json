  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the logical flow of the original dialogue. Most sentences convey the intended ideas, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can follow. However, there are several awkward phrasings (e.g., \"¡Hola y bienvenido en …\", \"aprendizaje en última hora\") and occasional missing accents that slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains numerous non‑native constructions and literal renderings that feel stilted. Phrases such as \"¡Hola y bienvenido en\", \"el afinamiento... es allí donde interviene\", and \"aprendizaje en última hora\" are not idiomatic Spanish. Some punctuation and capitalization errors (e.g., missing accent on \"¡Hola y bienvenido en\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" without capitalisation) further reduce naturalness. A native speaker would need to edit the text for fluidity.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely preserved and correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". The translator consistently uses the same Spanish equivalents, which helps readability. The only minor issue is the translation of \"cramming\" as \"aprendizaje en última hora\", which is understandable but not the most common term (\"estudio de última hora\" would be clearer).",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent of the podcast script is maintained, and the examples (consultant, graduate, etc.) are kept. Nonetheless, some expressions are too literal and do not adapt to Spanish‑speaking cultural expectations (e.g., \"¡Hola y bienvenido en\" instead of \"¡Hola y bienvenidos a\"). The occasional retention of French words such as \"antisèche\" with only a brief parenthetical explanation may confuse readers unfamiliar with the term. These issues lower the adaptation score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the content of the original French dialogue is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas or details are omitted, and the structure of the conversation is kept intact. Minor stylistic redundancies exist but do not affect the transmission of information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in transmitting the full technical content of the original podcast and uses appropriate terminology for the target audience. Readability is acceptable, but fluency suffers from several literal and unidiomatic constructions. Minor terminology choices and occasional retention of French words slightly reduce the naturalness. With a light post‑editing pass to smooth phrasing and correct minor errors, the text would be a solid, professional Spanish version of the original.\nOverall rating (average of the five criteria): 15.6 → rounded to 16/20.\nOverall score: 16 out of 20 points."
