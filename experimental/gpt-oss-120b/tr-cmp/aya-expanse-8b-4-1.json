  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but the sentence structure is often repetitive and overly long. Some paragraphs repeat the same idea multiple times, making it harder to follow. Minor ambiguities (e.g., \"marca de memoria a corto plazo\") also reduce smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several awkward constructions and shifts in register (mix of \"tú\" and \"usted\", informal vs formal). Phrases like \"marca de memoria a corto plazo\" and duplicated clauses feel literal and unnatural. Overall the translation sounds stilted rather than conversational.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved, but consistency suffers. \"pre‑entrenamiento\"/\"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\" kept in English, \"grounding\" rendered as \"enraizamiento\" only once, and \"in‑context learning\" is sometimes called \"marca de memoria a corto plazo\". The terminology is understandable but not uniformly applied.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent is conveyed, yet the translation adds unnecessary repetitions and does not adapt the style to a natural Spanish podcast script. Cultural references are fine, but the excessive verbatim rendering makes the text feel mechanical.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No major factual information is lost; the key concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory features) are all present. The main drawback is redundancy rather than omission.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation transmits the core ideas of the original French podcast, but its readability and fluency are hampered by repetitive phrasing, inconsistent terminology, and occasional unnatural language choices. While technically accurate, the text would benefit from a tighter, more natural rewrite that respects Spanish conversational style and maintains consistent terminology throughout.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14/20."
