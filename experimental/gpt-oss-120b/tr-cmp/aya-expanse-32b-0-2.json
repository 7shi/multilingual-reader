  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and follows a logical flow that mirrors the original French podcast script. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can follow. Minor hiccups (e.g., mixed gender pronouns for \"IA\") do not seriously impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, using idiomatic Spanish and appropriate register for a conversational podcast. A few constructions feel slightly awkward or literal (e.g., \"partes de un contexto vacío\", \"ICL (Lenguaje de Comprensión e Investigación)\"), and there are occasional inconsistencies in gender agreement, but overall the text sounds fluent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely well‑handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are correctly rendered. The major flaw is the incorrect expansion of the acronym ICL as \"Lenguaje de Comprensión e Investigación\" (the correct translation would be \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\"). This could confuse readers familiar with the field, lowering the score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original tone (informal, podcast‑like) and adapts cultural references appropriately for Spanish‑speaking audiences. No French‑specific idioms are left untranslated, and the content feels tailored to the target readership. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve flow, but the overall adaptation is strong.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. The only notable loss is the inaccurate definition of ICL mentioned later, which could mislead readers. No substantive content is omitted, and the structure remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the original content accurately, maintains readability and a natural podcast tone, and handles most technical terminology well. The primary weaknesses are a mis‑translation of the ICL acronym and a few minor fluency hiccups. With a small edit to fix the acronym expansion and smooth out a couple of sentences, the text would be near‑perfect for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
