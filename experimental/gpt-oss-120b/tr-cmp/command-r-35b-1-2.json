  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Most sentences convey the original ideas without confusing structures. Minor issues such as leftover markdown (** **), an unnecessary parenthetical note \"(desciframos)\" and a few missing accent marks slightly detract from smooth comprehension, but they do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, using appropriate colloquial Spanish. A few phrasing choices feel overly literal (e.g., \"Miren esto\", \"el 'affinage'\"), and occasional mixed‑language tags break the flow. Overall, native speakers would find it understandable but notice the occasional awkwardness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje/grounding, etc. The translation sometimes keeps the French word \"affinage\" in quotes, which is inconsistent, and occasionally repeats English terms in parentheses. Still, terminology is largely appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The podcast tone is preserved, with a friendly greeting and conversational style adapted to Spanish listeners. Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is needed. Minor leftover markup does not affect the intended message. The translation successfully conveys the original intent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French original is present. No major ideas or examples are omitted, and the logical flow of the discussion is maintained. The only minor loss is the occasional redundant formatting, which does not affect content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, this is a solid translation that captures the technical content and conversational tone of the original podcast. It is accurate and mostly fluent, though it suffers from a few leftover formatting marks, minor inconsistencies in terminology, and occasional literal phrasing that feels slightly unnatural to native Spanish speakers. With a quick editorial pass to clean up markdown artifacts and harmonize term usage, the translation would be excellent.\n\nFinal aggregate score (out of 100): 80/100."
