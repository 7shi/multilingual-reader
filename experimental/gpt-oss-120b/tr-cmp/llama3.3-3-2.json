  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and the technical ideas are conveyed in an understandable way. However, the inclusion of translator’s side‑comments (e.g., “?Es decir? or more naturally ?Qué quieres decir?”) and an editorial parenthesis after “Ella lo olvida todo” interrupt the flow and can confuse a reader. Mixed use of “tú” and “usted” also slightly hampers smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places and uses appropriate vocabulary. Minor awkwardness appears in a few sentences (e.g., “aprendizaje automático en contexto” instead of a smoother “aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”) and the aforementioned meta‑comments break fluency. Overall, a native speaker would find it fairly smooth but not polished.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as «pré‑entraînement», «fine‑tuning», «In‑Context Learning», «prompt» and «grounding» are mostly handled correctly. The term «ancrage (grounding)» is rendered as “anclaje (anclaje)”, which loses the original English word and is a slight inconsistency. Apart from that, the terminology is consistent and appropriate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone and explanatory style of the podcast. Added phrases like “Es un placer tenerlos aquí” are benign and fit the context. Nevertheless, the presence of translator notes and mixed register (formal / informal pronouns) detracts from a fully adapted version for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the factual content of the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted; only extra editorial comments were inserted, which do not remove information but add noise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. The main drawbacks are the leftover translator notes and occasional inconsistencies in pronoun usage and a few awkward phrasings. Removing the meta‑comments, standardising the register, and fixing the grounding translation would raise the quality to a near‑native level."
