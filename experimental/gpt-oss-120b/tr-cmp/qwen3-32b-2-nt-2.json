  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version flows naturally and preserves the logical sequence of the original French dialogue. Sentences are clear, the concepts are explained in an accessible way, and there are no confusing fragments. Minor stylistic switches between \"tú\" and \"usted\" do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for native Spanish speakers. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. A few minor issues—mix of formal/informal pronouns, and the phrase \"en segundo plano\" for \"en coulisses\"—are slightly less idiomatic but do not break fluency.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, grounding, memoria a corto plazo, ventana de contexto, ajuste fino, etc. Where the original kept English terms (e.g., \"grounding\"), the translation does the same with a clear parenthetical. No crucial term is lost or mistranslated.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish‑speaking listeners, using familiar analogies (consultor brillante, aprender a andar en bicicleta). Cultural references are kept neutral, which is appropriate. The slight inconsistency in register (tú vs usted) is the only minor drawback.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No sentences or ideas have been omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of very high quality. It conveys the original content accurately, uses suitable technical language, and remains easy to understand for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic inconsistencies prevent a perfect score, but the work is essentially excellent and could be used as‑is for a podcast transcript.\n\nStrengths: faithful rendering of concepts, clear structure, correct handling of technical jargon. Areas for improvement: maintain a consistent pronoun register throughout, and consider slightly more idiomatic phrasing for \"en coulisses\" (e.g., \"detrás de escena\")."
