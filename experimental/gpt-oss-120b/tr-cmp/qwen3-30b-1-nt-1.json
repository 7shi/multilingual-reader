    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are clear. A minor hiccup is the plural \"informaciones\" instead of the more natural singular \"información\", but this does not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural to a native speaker. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and the dialogue flows smoothly. Small inconsistencies (\"aprendizaje en contexto\" vs \"aprendizaje contextual\", and the less common term \"anclaje\" for \"grounding\") create a slight feeling of awkwardness, but they are not jarring.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\" (fine‑tuning), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\". The translation of \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\" is understandable, though \"enraizamiento\" or \"fundamentación\" could be more standard. Consistency is largely maintained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original intent perfectly for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are preserved, the tone remains conversational, and the examples (consultor, estudiante de último minuto) are equally relatable. Minor lexical choices do not affect the overall purpose.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present. No substantive content is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary filler. The only negligible loss is the parenthetical \"(fine‑tuning)\" after \"afinamiento\", which does not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical concepts accurately and keeps the lively podcast tone. Minor issues such as a plural noun where singular is usual, slight inconsistency in terminology, and the choice of \"anclaje\" for \"grounding\" prevent a perfect score, but they do not detract significantly from readability or correctness. The result would be easily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners and serves the original purpose well."
