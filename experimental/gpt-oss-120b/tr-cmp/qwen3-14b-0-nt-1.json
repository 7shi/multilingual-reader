  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the flow of ideas mirrors the original. Minor issues such as occasional over‑formal phrasing (e.g., “Usted ha entendido todo”) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few constructions feel slightly stiff or literal (e.g., “Vean esto:” instead of “Veamos esto”, “El afinado” rather than a more common “fine‑tuning”). Vocabulary is appropriate, yet the register varies between formal and informal.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “afinado (fine‑tuning)”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL”, “grounding → anclaje”. The term “prompt” is left in English, which is acceptable for a technical audience. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the podcast greeting (“Buenos días”) and keeps the conversational tone suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Cultural references are preserved, and the analogy of a consultant is rendered naturally. No cultural mismatches are evident.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present. No sentences or concepts are omitted, and the nuances about temporary vs. permanent knowledge, memory tricks, and the distinction between ICL and fine‑tuning are fully retained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and maintains the podcast’s engaging style. Minor fluency hiccups and occasional register inconsistencies prevent it from being perfect, but they do not affect the listener’s understanding.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
