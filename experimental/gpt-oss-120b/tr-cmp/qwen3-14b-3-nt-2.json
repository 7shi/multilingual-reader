    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and the dialogue flows logically. Most sentences are understandable for a general audience, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in a way that mirrors the original. Minor hiccups (e.g., overly long sentences, occasional missing connective words) slightly impede smooth reading, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are a few awkward constructions: \"Imaginen:\" without a following clause, \"crammar\" instead of \"estudiar de último momento\", and the unnecessary insertion of \"Instruccional\" in \"Aprendizaje Contextual Instruccional (ICL)\". Vocabulary is generally appropriate, yet the phrasing occasionally feels literal rather than idiomatic.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well‑handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\" and \"memoria\" are correctly rendered. However, \"afinamiento\" is a less common translation for \"fine‑tuning\" (\"ajuste fino\" would be preferred) and the added \"Instruccional\" creates inconsistency. The mistake \"crammar\" shows a misunderstanding of the original \"bachoter\". These issues lower the overall terminology score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the content to Spanish‑speaking listeners effectively, preserving the podcast tone and educational intent. Cultural references are neutral and the examples remain relevant. The only notable mis‑adaptation is the erroneous \"crammar\" phrase, but overall the adaptation is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. Minor inaccuracies (the \"crammar\" error and the extra \"Instruccional\" label) slightly distort the original meaning, but no major sections are omitted.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the educational content of the podcast with good fidelity. It is readable and mostly fluent, though a handful of lexical slips and non‑standard technical translations prevent it from being perfect. With minor edits—especially correcting \"crammar\", using the more common term \"ajuste fino\", and removing the spurious \"Instruccional\" label—the text would reach native‑level quality.\n\nOverall, the work demonstrates a strong grasp of both languages and the subject matter, earning a respectable score.\n\n**Overall Score:** 16/20"
