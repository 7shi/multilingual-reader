  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is a jumble of placeholders (e.g., **Revised version**, **Versión mejorada**), editorial notes, and side‑by‑side comparisons rather than a continuous Spanish rendering of the podcast script. A Spanish‑speaking reader cannot follow a narrative; the structure jumps between French, English, and Spanish without clear separation. Consequently comprehension is extremely difficult.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Because the output mixes languages, bracketed instructions, and meta‑comments, it never achieves the smooth, natural flow expected of a native Spanish text. There are many unfinished sentences, abrupt shifts, and literal translations that sound awkward. Fluency is therefore very low.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as «pré‑entraînement», «affinage», «apprentissage par transfert», «fenêtre de contexte», «apprentissage en contexte (ICL)» are mentioned, but their treatment is inconsistent: sometimes a French term is kept, sometimes an English acronym is introduced, sometimes a Spanish equivalent is suggested without a clear decision. The lack of consistent terminology harms the reader’s understanding.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation does not adapt the original French podcast to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Instead of delivering the intended explanatory tone, it provides editorial guidance (“versión más natural”, “nota”, “recomendación final”). Cultural or contextual adjustments that would make the content resonate with Spanish listeners are absent.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Much of the original dialogue is missing; only isolated fragments appear (e.g., “El preentrenamiento (o entrenamiento previo)”). The core explanations, analogies, and flow of the podcast are largely omitted, resulting in severe loss of information.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "overall_comment": "The provided ‘translation’ is not a finished translation at all but a collection of revision notes and alternative phrasings. It fails to deliver a readable, fluent, or complete Spanish version of the original French podcast script. To be usable, the text would need to be rewritten from scratch, selecting consistent terminology, removing all meta‑commentary, and presenting the dialogue in a natural, continuous Spanish narrative that preserves the educational tone of the original.\n\nGiven the current state, the work scores very low across all criteria, reflecting that it is essentially an intermediate draft rather than a final translation."
