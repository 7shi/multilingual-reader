  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas without excessive complexity, and the podcast dialogue format is preserved. A few long sentences could be broken up for smoother reading, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are occasional awkward expressions (e.g., \"consultor temporario\" instead of \"consultor temporal\", and occasional literal renderings that feel a bit stiff). Vocabulary is appropriate, yet a few phrasing choices could be refined for native‑speaker fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled very well. Key terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"refinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" and \"grounding\" (anclaje) are correctly translated or retained with clear explanations. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and podcast style. Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor issues like the unusual \"consultor temporario\" slightly reduce the adaptation quality, but overall the message is effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All relevant information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue, ensuring that listeners receive the full explanation.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and faithful to the source. It delivers the technical concepts clearly and retains the conversational podcast feel. Minor fluency hiccups and a few non‑idiomatic word choices prevent a perfect score, but the text is highly understandable and technically accurate.\n\nOverall rating (average of criteria): 17/20.\n\nStrengths: accurate terminology, complete information, clear readability. \nAreas for improvement: polish some phrasing to sound more natural to native speakers, especially the use of \"consultor temporal\" instead of \"consultor temporario\" and breaking up long sentences.\n\nOverall score: 17"
