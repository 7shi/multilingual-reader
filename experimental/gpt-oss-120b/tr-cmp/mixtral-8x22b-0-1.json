  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the dialogic format is preserved, so a Spanish‑speaking listener can understand the concepts without difficulty. A few very long sentences could be split for better flow, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places. Word order, verb tenses and idiomatic expressions are appropriate. Minor issues affect fluency: the English loan‑word *cheat sheet* is left untranslated, and the phrase “una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje contextual automatizado” feels slightly forced. These quirks prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely correct: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL* are kept or explained. However, the French term *ancrage* is retained alongside the English *grounding* instead of using the Spanish *anclaje* or *acople*, and the abbreviation ICL is not expanded for a Spanish audience. Consistency could be improved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent, tone and educational purpose. Cultural references are neutral, so no loss of meaning occurs. Some expressions could be more idiomatic for a Spanish audience (e.g., “consultor brillante” vs. “consultor excelente”), but overall the adaptation is successful.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the dialogue flow is preserved. Redundancies are minimal and the added parentheses for translations help clarity.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. It reads well, keeps the pedagogical style, and includes virtually all the original information. Small issues—untranslated English loan‑words, occasional overly literal phrasing, and inconsistent handling of a few technical terms—prevent it from being flawless, but they do not impede understanding. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience."
