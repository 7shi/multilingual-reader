    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the flow mirrors the original French dialogue. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, transferencia de aprendizaje and aprendizaje en contexto are explained in a straightforward manner, making the content comprehensible for a non‑expert audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for native Spanish speakers. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and the conversational tone (¡Exacto!, ¡Lo has comprendido todo!) feels authentic. Minor hiccups exist – e.g., “el modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus conversaciones” is slightly formal and a bit clunky, and occasional over‑use of exclamation marks – but they do not hinder overall fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently and accurately: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), grounding → anclaje. The acronyms are retained and explained, and no key term is mistranslated or omitted.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the intent and tone of the original podcast, adapting the style to Spanish‑speaking listeners (use of “¡Exacto!”, “¡Lo has comprendido todo!”). Cultural references are neutral, so no loss of meaning occurs. A few expressions are literal (“ventana de contexto”) but they are already accepted in Spanish technical discourse.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is retained. No sentences are omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as in the source. The translation does not introduce redundancies and keeps the content concise while preserving nuance.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains readable and mostly fluent, and respects the original conversational style. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve smoothness, but they do not detract from the effectiveness of the translation.\n\nStrengths: precise terminology, faithful rendering of concepts, clear structure.\nAreas for improvement: smooth out a few overly formal or clunky phrases and moderate exclamation usage for a more natural spoken tone.\n\nThe translation would be well‑understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners of a tech podcast and fulfills the purpose of the original script effectively.\n\nScore out of 20 (average of criteria): 18.4 → 18"
