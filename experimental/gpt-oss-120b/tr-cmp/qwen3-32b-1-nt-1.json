  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall easy to follow and the complex concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory) are explained clearly. Sentence structure is logical, though a few constructions are slightly clunky (e.g., “Puede tomar un modelo experto en inglés, luego presentarle…”, “Cuando abre una nueva ventana, parte de un contexto vacío”). These minor hiccups do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are occasional awkward phrasing choices: “Miren:” as a stand‑alone interjection, “El preentrenamiento.” as an isolated line, and the use of “afinamiento” (still understandable but less common than “ajuste fino”). Vocabulary is appropriate, but a few sentences could be smoother. Overall, a native speaker would understand it without effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and “anclaje” are consistently used. While “afinamiento” and “anclaje” are not the most common translations, they are clear and kept consistent throughout. The English abbreviations are preserved, which is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and didactic style of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogies (consultant, cheat‑sheet, bike riding) are rendered naturally for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor improvements could be made to idiomatic phrasing, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant details are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue. Redundancies are not introduced, and the content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and faithfully conveys the technical content of the original French podcast. Readability and terminology are strong, and the core information is fully retained. Fluency could be polished in a few places, and some terminology choices, while understandable, could be replaced by more standard Spanish equivalents. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts."
