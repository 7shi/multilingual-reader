    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow and the logical flow of the dialogue is preserved. Most sentences are clear, and complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia and aprendizaje en contexto are explained in a straightforward way. A few minor phrasing issues (e.g., \"el ajuste fine\" instead of \"ajuste fino\") slightly hinder smooth reading, but they do not block comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the text sounds natural, but there are several awkward constructions that a native speaker would not use: \"aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje\", \"aprendizaje de ida y vuelta basado en IA\", \"le hemos proporcionado un 'preguntas y respuestas'\". These oddities reduce the feeling of fluency, even though the rest of the translation reads well.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje de transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"grounding\" rendered as \"ancraje\" (a less common term, \"anclaje\" would be preferable). The term \"fine‑tuning\" is translated inconsistently (\"ajuste fine\" vs. the more common \"ajuste fino\"). Nevertheless, the intended meaning is preserved throughout.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the original intent and adapts the examples (consultant, memory feature) appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the explanatory tone is maintained. Minor lexical choices (e.g., \"ancraje\") are slightly off but do not affect the overall message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the structure of the dialogue remains intact. The only issues are stylistic rather than informational.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and is largely understandable. It captures the technical concepts and the conversational style, but it suffers from occasional unnatural phrasing and inconsistent terminology. With a few refinements—especially standardizing technical terms and smoothing out awkward sentences—the text would reach a higher level of native‑like quality.\nOverall, the translation is good, functional, and faithful, though not fully polished.\nScore: 17/20 overall (average of the five criteria)."
