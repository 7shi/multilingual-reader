  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory) are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can understand. A few long sentences could be broken up for better flow, and the phrase \"ventana contextual\" is less common than \"ventana de contexto\", but the meaning is still evident.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, with appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic expressions. Minor awkwardness appears in places such as \"ventana contextual\", \"aprendizaje puntual\" (instead of repeating \"aprendizaje en contexto\"), and the shift from \"ajuste fino\" to \"optimización\" later in the dialogue, which can feel inconsistent to a native speaker.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"transferencia de aprendizaje\", \"In‑Context Learning (ICL)\", \"grounding\", etc. However, the inconsistency between \"ajuste fino\" and later \"optimización\" may confuse readers about whether the same process is being described. Also, \"aprendizaje puntual\" is not a standard term for in‑context learning. These issues lower the overall consistency of terminology.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately. The podcast format is preserved, and the examples (consultant vs. expert, cramming for an exam) are conveyed effectively for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor lexical choices could be refined, but the overall adaptation is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the dialogue flow mirrors the original. Redundancy is minimal and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does an excellent job of transmitting the original podcast dialogue, preserving the educational tone and the technical depth. Readability and completeness are high, and the text feels natural for Spanish readers. The main areas for improvement are terminology consistency (maintaining \"ajuste fino\" throughout) and polishing a few awkward expressions (e.g., \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" instead of \"aprendizaje puntual\"). With these minor tweaks, the translation would be near‑perfect."
