  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the technical ideas are explained clearly. Minor redundancies (e.g., repeating “aprendizaje en contexto”) and a couple of long sentences slightly affect flow, but a native reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, but there are a few awkward spots: the duplicated phrase “aprendizaje en contexto, o aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, inconsistent naming of the podcast (“Tecnología Revelada” vs. “Tecnología Rápida”), and occasional overly literal constructions. These issues prevent it from being completely seamless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclado, prompt, etc. The terminology is consistent and appropriate for the target audience. Only minor duplication of the ICL acronym occurs.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original tone and style well for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience. Cultural references are handled correctly, and the language feels suitable. The main drawback is the inconsistent translation of the podcast’s title, which can confuse listeners about the brand identity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No important concept is omitted, and the explanations remain faithful. Redundancies are minimal and do not cause loss of information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and is largely clear and natural. Strengths include solid handling of technical terminology and faithful transmission of the educational narrative. Weaknesses lie in minor stylistic repetitions and the inconsistent rendering of the podcast’s name, which slightly detracts from fluency and contextual coherence. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation that only needs small polishing to reach excellence.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
