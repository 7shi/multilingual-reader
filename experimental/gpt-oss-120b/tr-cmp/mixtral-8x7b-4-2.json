  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but several sentences are clunky or contain stray characters (e.g., \"...en general.\"}''). These interruptions break the flow and force the reader to reread. Some French words remain (\"université\", \"Tech Éclair\"), which can confuse a Spanish‑only audience. Overall the main ideas are conveyed, but the logical progression is sometimes obscured.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are numerous non‑native constructions: \"ancraje\" instead of \"anclaje\", \"Elimina todo\" for \"Olvida todo\", mixed use of English/French acronyms, and redundant phrasing. Verb tenses and article usage are occasionally incorrect, making the text sound translated rather than written directly in Spanish. The translation lacks the smooth, natural rhythm expected from native prose.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"ICL\" are correctly rendered. However, the translation is inconsistent (\"fine‑tuning\" appears in parentheses, \"aprendizaje en contexto\" is repeated unnecessarily) and sometimes leaves the original French term unchanged. The terminology is mostly appropriate but not fully consistent.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator kept many literal equivalents from French, which sometimes feel out of place in Spanish (e.g., \"consultor brillante\" is fine, but the phrase \"una nueva IA\" sounds odd). Cultural adaptation is minimal; the podcast name remains in French, which may be acceptable but could have been explained. Overall, the intent is preserved but the adaptation could be smoother.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the original information is present; no major ideas are omitted. The only drawbacks are minor redundancies and stray characters that do not add new meaning. Therefore, the content is complete, albeit a bit noisy.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original dialogue and technical concepts, but it suffers from several linguistic inaccuracies, awkward phrasing, and occasional leftover French terms. While the information is largely intact, the readability and fluency are compromised, making the text feel like a rough machine translation rather than a polished Spanish script. A thorough edit focusing on natural expression, consistent terminology, and removal of artefacts would raise the quality significantly.\n\nOverall rating (out of 20): 11"
