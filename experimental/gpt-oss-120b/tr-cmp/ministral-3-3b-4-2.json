  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is overloaded with parenthetical notes, alternative phrasings, and meta‑explanations that were not present in the original French script. This makes the flow chaotic and forces the reader to constantly switch between the intended dialogue and the translator’s commentary. Sentences are often long and contain abrupt switches (e.g., “Camille: Dans le contexte d'un dialogue technique…”, “Luc: Cuando abres una nueva ventana…”). Consequently, a native Spanish‑speaking audience would struggle to follow the conversation as a podcast script.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most vocabulary is correct, many expressions sound stilted or overly literal (e.g., “preentrenamiento” vs. the more common “pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje en contexto” used inconsistently, “memoria a uso único”). The insertion of English terms in parentheses, redundant repetitions, and occasional grammatical slips (e.g., “la información almacenada no persiste entre conversaciones, sino que se reutiliza en el contexto actual para mejorar la precisión de la respuesta.”) hinder naturalness. The text does not read like a spoken podcast but rather like a written technical commentary.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, grounding) are generally rendered correctly and consistently. However, the translation sometimes adds unnecessary explanations that dilute the terminology (e.g., multiple parenthetical expansions for the same concept). Some terms are left in French or English, breaking consistency. Overall, the handling of terminology is acceptable but not optimal.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator attempts cultural adaptation (e.g., using “consultor brillante” instead of “consultant”) but over‑compensates by inserting extensive meta‑comments that were never part of the original. The tone shifts between formal exposition and instructional notes, which does not match the original podcast’s conversational style. Hence, the adaptation is only partially successful.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, temporary vs. permanent memory, and the notion of “memory” features. Nevertheless, the translation adds many optional phrasings and sometimes truncates or re‑orders sentences (e.g., the final farewell is incomplete). The core information is conveyed, but the added noise reduces clarity.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the essential technical content but is far from a clean, podcast‑ready Spanish script. It is cluttered with translator’s side notes, alternative translations, and explanatory digressions that break the natural flow and make the text difficult to read aloud. Terminology is mostly correct, yet the over‑explanation and inconsistent style lower overall quality. A revised version should strip out the meta‑commentary, streamline sentences, and adopt a more conversational tone appropriate for a spoken podcast.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 10.2/20."
