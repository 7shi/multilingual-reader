  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the concepts are explained clearly. Most sentences are easy to follow, though occasional phrasing such as “Ustedes han entendido perfectamente” sounds slightly formal for a podcast dialogue. Overall, a Spanish‑speaking listener can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are minor inconsistencies (mixing “Ustedes” and “vosotros/podéis”, occasional literal renderings like “una IA completamente nueva”). These do not break comprehension but give a slightly stilted impression for native ears.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “transfer learning” (explained as aprendizaje por transferencia), “ventana de contexto”, “In‑Context Learning”, “grounding”. English loanwords are kept in quotes, preserving the original jargon. No major mistranslations.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The podcast tone is preserved and cultural references are appropriate. Small issues with pronoun consistency (Ustedes vs vosotros) slightly affect cohesion, but the intent and style of the original are effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue elements and explanatory details from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No important information is omitted or distorted, and the translation remains concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid overall, conveying the technical discussion clearly and preserving the conversational podcast style. Minor stylistic and consistency issues prevent it from being completely natural, but the terminology is accurate and no content is lost. It would benefit from a uniform register (choosing either Ustedes or vosotros throughout) and smoothing a few literal constructions, but it remains a high‑quality translation suitable for the intended audience.\nTotal score: 85/100."
