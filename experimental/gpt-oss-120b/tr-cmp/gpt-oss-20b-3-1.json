  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) are explained in plain language. Only a couple of very long sentences could be split for better flow, but overall the reader can understand without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and most idiomatic expressions are well rendered. Minor awkwardness appears in phrases such as “es un mero repaso” (a more natural wording would be “es solo un repaso”) and the occasional retention of English words like “prompt”, but these do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: “preentrenamiento”, “afinación (fine‑tuning)”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (In‑Context Learning)”, “anclaje (grounding)”. The occasional use of the English term “prompt” is acceptable in a tech‑focused podcast. Overall terminology is accurate and coherent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator kept the original intent and tone of a conversational podcast. Cultural references are adapted (e.g., “es como contratar a un consultor brillante”). The style matches a Spanish‑speaking audience and no French‑specific idioms remain untranslated.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent nature of knowledge, and the explanation of “memoria” features. No essential information is omitted.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, reads naturally for Spanish listeners, and preserves the podcast’s informal, explanatory tone. Minor phrasing tweaks could improve smoothness, but they do not affect overall comprehension. The work demonstrates solid bilingual competence and good handling of technical jargon.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20.\nScore out of 20 points: 18"
