    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and easy to follow. Most sentences convey the original ideas without confusing structures. Minor issues such as the untranslated French interjection \"D'accord.\" and occasional long sentences slightly affect flow, but overall a native Spanish reader can understand the content comfortably.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are a few awkward phrasings (e.g., \"lee una cantidad masiva de datos\", \"La IA no tiene «olvidado»\", retaining English terms like \"fine‑tuning\"), and the stray French phrase breaks the smoothness. These prevent the text from feeling completely native.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is mostly well handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly rendered. However, some English terms are left untranslated (\"fine‑tuning\", \"grounding\"/\"ancrage\"), and the Spanish equivalent could have been used for consistency (e.g., \"ajuste fino\").",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only notable lapse is the untranslated French interjection, which slightly reduces adaptation quality.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the logical order of the discussion is retained. The stray \"D'accord.\" is a minor formatting issue rather than a loss of meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation does an excellent job of conveying the technical discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning. Readability and fidelity are strong, though fluency and terminology could be refined by eliminating remaining English words and fixing the isolated French phrase. With a few polish tweaks, the text would read as a seamless, native‑speaker podcast script.\n\nScore (out of 100): 80/100."
