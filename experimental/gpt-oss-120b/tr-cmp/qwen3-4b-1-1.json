  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences are clear, but a few long constructions and minor grammatical slips (e.g., “Los conocencias desaparecen”) slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several unnatural expressions: “Los conocencias”, “prueba de fuego” for “cheat‑sheet”, “Usted ha entendido completamente”, and “en segunda plano”. These make the translation feel a bit stilted for a native speaker, although the overall flow remains acceptable.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, ventana de contexto, grounding) are mostly preserved and correctly rendered. However, inconsistencies appear (e.g., mixing English “fine‑tuning” with Spanish, mistranslating “knowledge” as “conocencias”), which could confuse readers with a technical background.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Formal “Usted” is used throughout, which is acceptable but slightly more formal than the original French. Minor cultural mismatches (e.g., “prueba de fuego”) reduce the natural fit.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present; no substantive information is omitted. The only issues are the small lexical inaccuracies that do not remove content but may alter nuance.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transferring the content of the podcast and keeps the technical discussion intact. Readability and completeness are strong, but fluency and terminology suffer from a handful of awkward word choices and mistranslations. With a bit of polishing—correcting ‘conocencias’, using a more appropriate term for ‘cheat‑sheet’, and ensuring consistent handling of English technical terms—the text would read like a native‑level Spanish podcast script.\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 78/100."
