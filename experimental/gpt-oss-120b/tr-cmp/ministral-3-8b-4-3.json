  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The answer is presented as a long list of isolated translation suggestions, alternatives and meta‑comments rather than a single coherent text. A Spanish‑speaking reader would have to sift through many brackets, headings and duplicated content to understand the intended narrative, which makes the passage hard to follow. Sentence structure is often broken by parenthetical notes, and the flow is interrupted by meta‑explanations (e.g., “---**Key improvements**”). Consequently, comprehension is low.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While many of the individual sentences are well‑crafted and sound natural, the overall document feels fragmented. The frequent use of asterisks, capitalisation for emphasis, and mixed registers (formal, casual, technical) creates an inconsistent tone. The presence of English terms (e.g., “prompt”, “ICL”) without consistent Spanish equivalents also reduces naturalness.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, ventana de contexto, ICL, matriz de pesos, etc.) is largely accurate and consistent across the alternatives. When a term could be ambiguous, the translator often supplies a brief explanation. However, the proliferation of alternatives sometimes introduces redundant or conflicting terms, which can be confusing.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator makes an effort to adapt cultural references (e.g., keeping “bachotage” with explanations, using “consultor” vs “experto”) and to choose register‑appropriate phrasing. Yet the sheer volume of options makes it hard to see which adaptation is intended, and some choices (e.g., “memoria persistente” for a feature that is still experimental) may over‑interpret the original intent.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the original French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, temporary vs permanent knowledge, memory features, etc. No critical information is omitted. The downside is that the information is duplicated many times across alternatives, leading to redundancy and potential confusion about the final message.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a deep understanding of the technical content and provides many well‑phrased Spanish alternatives. However, as a final product it is not usable because it is a collection of suggestions rather than a single, polished translation. To be effective, the translator should select one consistent version, remove meta‑comments, and present the dialogue as a continuous script. With those edits, the technical accuracy would be strong, but in its current form the text scores modestly overall.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 8.6 ≈ 9/20."
