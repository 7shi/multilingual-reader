  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences convey the original meaning, and complex concepts are explained with simple analogies. However, there are occasional redundancies (e.g., the pre‑training explanation is repeated) and some overly long sentences that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part and uses appropriate colloquial expressions. Nevertheless, a few constructions feel awkward or literal (e.g., \"¡Exacto. El aprendizaje en contexto es como estudiar para un examen\"; \"¡Ella olvida todo\"), and there are minor grammatical slips such as duplicated phrases and occasional mismatches in verb tense. Overall, a native speaker would understand it, but the flow is not perfectly polished.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\" (instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\" but still understandable), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL). The abbreviation \"ICL\" is kept, though a typo \"IC\" appears once. Consistency is good, and the terminology matches the expected level for a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast tone and intent, adapting cultural references appropriately (e.g., \"Tecnología Flash\" for \"Tech Éclair\"). Some sentences could be re‑phrased to better suit Spanish‑speaking listeners, but the overall message and educational purpose are maintained.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of \"memory\" features. Minor repetitions and a slight re‑ordering do not cause loss of information. No critical content is omitted.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and is largely readable for Spanish‑speaking audiences. While the terminology is well handled and the essential information is complete, the text suffers from occasional redundancy, minor grammatical slips, and a few unnatural phrasing choices that prevent it from being fully fluent. A light editorial pass to tighten sentences and eliminate duplicated sections would bring the quality to a higher level.\nOverall, the work is solid and functional, suitable for a tech podcast, but it could benefit from polishing for native‑speaker polish.\nScore: 81/100 (average of the five criteria)."
