    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow for native speakers. The dialogue format is preserved, and the complex ideas about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained clearly. Some sentences are long, but they remain comprehensible. No crucial information is lost, so the text is largely readable.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but a few lexical choices feel odd to a Spanish‑speaking audience: \"el afinado\" instead of the usual \"ajuste fino\", \"pre‑entrenamiento\" with a hyphen, and expressions like \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje contextual automático\" that could be smoother. These minor awkwardnesses prevent a perfect fluency rating.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well handled. \"In‑Context Learning\" (ICL), \"grounding\", \"ventana de contexto\", etc., are rendered correctly. The main weakness is the translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"el afinado\", which is not the standard term in Spanish (normally \"ajuste fino\" or \"fine‑tuning\" in italics). Apart from that, the terminology is consistent and appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts it to a Spanish‑speaking audience. The use of Spanish‑style punctuation and the preservation of the podcast tone work well. A few French‑style quotation marks (« » ) remain, but they do not hinder comprehension. Overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and the dialogue flow is maintained. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy, keeping the content concise and faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the technical content well. Readability and completeness are strong points. Fluency and terminology could be polished, especially by using the more common Spanish term \"ajuste fino\" for fine‑tuning and by smoothing a few slightly clunky phrases. With those minor adjustments, the text would read as a natural, professional Spanish podcast script."
