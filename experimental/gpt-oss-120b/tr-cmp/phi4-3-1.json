  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are clear. A few very long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but overall a native‑speaker would understand without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are occasional literal renderings that feel slightly awkward: “vuestra datos” (should be “sus datos”), “Se puede decir eso” (more idiomatic would be “Se podría decir eso”), and the retention of the English word *prompt*. These minor slips prevent a perfect fluency rating.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled very well. Core terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ICL*, *grounding* are correctly translated or kept in parentheses, and the usage is consistent throughout the dialogue.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogies (e.g., consultant vs. expert, cramming for an exam) work in Spanish. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve idiomatic feel, but the overall adaptation is successful.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No key points are omitted, and the logical flow is maintained. The only issue is a small grammatical mistake (“vuestra datos”) which does not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the full technical content of the original podcast script. It is generally clear and faithful, with only a handful of minor linguistic imperfections that slightly affect naturalness. For a technical podcast aimed at a broad audience, the translation is of high quality and would be easily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\nStrengths: precise terminology, complete information transfer, clear explanations. Weaknesses: occasional literal phrasing and a few grammatical slips.\n\nOverall, the work is very solid and only needs light editing for perfect fluency and stylistic polish.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.2 ≈ 18/20."
