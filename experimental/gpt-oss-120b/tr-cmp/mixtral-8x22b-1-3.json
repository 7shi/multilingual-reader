    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original dialogue structure. However, there are several confusing elements that hurt readability: the line \"Camille: French: C'est‑à‑dire ? Spanish: ¿Cómo es eso?\" mixes languages and breaks the flow, and there are occasional encoding glitches (e.g., \"discusiĆ³n\"). Minor punctuation and accent errors also require the reader to pause. Overall, a native reader can follow the content but with some effort.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are numerous awkward constructions and redundancies: duplicate speaker tags (\"Luc: Luc:\"), literal translations that feel stiff (e.g., \"ventana de contexto\" is acceptable but the surrounding phrasing is clunky), and inconsistent use of terminology such as \"anclado\" instead of the more common \"anclaje\". These issues make the text feel slightly robotic rather than conversational.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\" are all appropriate. The term \"grounding\" is left in English with a parenthetical explanation, which is acceptable for a technical audience. Consistency is good, and no major mistranslations of technical concepts are observed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, adapting the podcast format to Spanish. Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is needed. The main drawback is the mixed‑language line mentioned earlier, which feels out of place for Spanish readers, and the final sign‑off keeps the French title \"Tech Éclair\" unchanged, slightly breaking immersion.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French source are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of \"memory\" features. Minor typographical errors and the duplicated speaker label do not remove information, so completeness is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical discussion accurately and keeps the conversational structure, but it suffers from several readability and fluency hiccups, most notably the mixed‑language line, duplicated tags, and occasional awkward phrasing. Technical terminology is well‑handled, and the essential information is intact. With some editorial polishing to remove the language‑mixing artefacts and smooth out phrasing, the translation would be much stronger.\nOverall score: 74/100."
