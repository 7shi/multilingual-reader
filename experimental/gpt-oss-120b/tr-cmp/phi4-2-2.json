  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are clear. Minor issues such as a slightly heavy use of parentheses do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural in most places and uses appropriate colloquial register for a podcast. There are a few awkward phrasings – e.g., \"aprendizaje contextual\" instead of the more common \"aprendizaje en contexto\", and \"el modelo mismo\" – but they do not break the flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved (preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL). The translation occasionally introduces non‑standard wording (\"aprendizaje contextual\"), and the acronym explanation is a bit redundant, but overall the terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent and podcast tone are well conveyed. Cultural references are adapted naturally (e.g., \"consultor brillante\"), and the Spanish phrasing respects the target audience’s expectations. No major cultural mismatches are observed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No key points are omitted, and the added parentheses do not remove meaning. The translation is faithful and complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate, clear and faithful to the source. It successfully transmits the technical explanations and the conversational style of the podcast. Minor terminological inconsistencies and a few slightly stilted phrases keep it from being perfect, but they do not hinder understanding. The work demonstrates solid competence in both languages and in conveying technical content to a general audience."
