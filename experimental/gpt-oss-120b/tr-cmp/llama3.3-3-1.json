  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences are clear, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can understand. Minor issues such as redundant wording (e.g., “Es donde interviene el concepto de ‘anclaje’ (anclaje)”) and a few slightly clunky constructions slightly reduce the flow, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several expressions that sound unnatural to native speakers: “Ustedes han entendido todo”, “Es una forma astuta de aprendizaje automático en contexto”, and the duplicated parenthetical term for ‘anclaje’. Some sentences are overly literal translations of French idioms, which makes the dialogue feel a bit stilted. Overall the text is understandable, but the lack of smooth, idiomatic Spanish prevents a higher rating.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, and the acronym ICL are preserved and correctly explained. The translation of “grounding” to “anclaje” is acceptable and consistently used. A minor point is the occasional retention of the English word “prompt”, which could have been italicized or explained, but this does not significantly detract from the technical accuracy.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the podcast’s informal, conversational tone and conveys the original intent. Some cultural adaptation choices (e.g., using “Ustedes” instead of a more natural “tú”) feel slightly formal for a podcast, and the duplicated phrase for “anclaje” shows a lack of polish. Nevertheless, the overall message and persuasive analogies are preserved for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the substantive information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the examples (English‑to‑French transfer, memory vs. fine‑tuning) are retained. The only redundancy is the repeated “Ella lo olvida todo”, which does not affect completeness but does add a slight inefficiency.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the technical content effectively. It succeeds in preserving the educational purpose of the podcast and includes the necessary terminology. However, the text suffers from occasional awkward phrasing, redundancy, and a few literal translations that make it feel less natural in Spanish. A revision focused on smoothing dialogue, removing duplicated terms, and choosing more idiomatic expressions would raise the fluency and readability scores substantially.\nOverall rating (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
