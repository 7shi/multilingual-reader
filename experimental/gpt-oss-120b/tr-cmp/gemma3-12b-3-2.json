    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear order. Most sentences are easy to follow, and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are adequately rendered. Minor hiccups such as a slightly long sentence about “el concepto de ‘fundamentación’” do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are a few awkward word choices. \"El perfeccionamiento\" is an uncommon rendering of fine‑tuning (\"ajuste fino\" would be more idiomatic). \"Fundamentación\" for \"grounding\" is also unusual; native speakers would expect \"anclaje\" or simply keep \"grounding\" in English. These issues lower the native‑speaker feel, though the rest of the text is smooth.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto) are all appropriate. The main weakness is the translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"perfeccionamiento\" and \"grounding\" as \"fundamentación,\" which are not standard in AI literature in Spanish. Consistency is otherwise good.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent, tone, and podcast format. It adapts the opening to a Spanish audience (\"¡Hola a todos!\"), keeps the podcast name \"Tecno Revelada,\" and preserves the explanatory style. Cultural references are neutral, so the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is retained. No major ideas are omitted, and the explanations are kept at the same level of detail. The only slight deviation is the non‑standard term for \"grounding,\" but the factual content remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and is generally clear and readable. It would benefit from more idiomatic terminology for fine‑tuning and grounding, which would raise fluency and technical precision. Apart from those lexical choices, the text is well‑structured and retains the educational tone of the podcast.\n\nOverall, the translation is solid but not fully native‑like, especially in specialized vocabulary.\n\nScore out of 100: 78/100.\n\nScore (overall): 78 }"
