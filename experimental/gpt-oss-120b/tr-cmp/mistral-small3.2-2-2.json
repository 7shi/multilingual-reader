  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version flows naturally and the complex ideas about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained clearly. Sentences are generally short and logical, making the content easy to follow for a native‑Spanish audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are a few awkward repetitions (e.g., \"aprendizaje en contexto, o aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\") and some phrasing that feels slightly literal (\"la IA no ha olvidado en el sentido humano\"). These minor hiccups keep the fluency just shy of perfect.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\" (rendered as \"afinamiento\" which is acceptable), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"grounding\" → \"anclado\". Consistency is mostly kept, though \"ajuste fino\" would be a more common translation than \"afinamiento\".",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, but the podcast name changes inconsistently (\"Tecnología Revelada\" at the start and \"Tecnología Rápida\" at the end). Keeping a single, consistent title would better respect the brand and cultural context. Apart from that, the cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present: description of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent knowledge distinction, and the explanation of the “memory” feature. No substantive information is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality and conveys the technical content accurately. Minor issues—repetitive phrasing, the slightly unconventional term \"afinamiento\", and inconsistent podcast naming—prevent it from being flawless, but they do not hinder comprehension. With a small editorial pass, the text would be fully polished for native speakers.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 88/100.\n\nThe translation excels in readability, terminology, and completeness, while fluency and contextual adaptation are slightly weaker due to the noted repetitions and naming inconsistency.\n\nScore: 88"
