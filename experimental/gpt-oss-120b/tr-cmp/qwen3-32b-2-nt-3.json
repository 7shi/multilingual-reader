  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor hiccups such as slightly clunky phrasing (“el aprendizaje en contexto, es como memorizar a corto plazo”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most of the dialogue, but there are a few unnatural constructions (“memorizando a corto plazo”, “el modelo experto en inglés”) and occasional missing accents or article mismatches. These quirks are minor but prevent the text from feeling completely native.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, prompt, etc. The choice of “afinamiento” instead of the more common “ajuste fino” is acceptable and consistent throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast tone and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., “consultor brillante”). The Spanish version feels suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience without losing the original intent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant details are omitted, and the dialogue structure is retained. The translation is concise yet complete.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is very good. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational style of the podcast, and is largely readable and natural for Spanish speakers. Minor stylistic and fluency issues keep it from being perfect, but they do not affect the overall comprehension.\n\nStrengths: precise terminology, faithful retention of information, appropriate cultural adaptation. Areas for improvement: smooth out a few awkward phrases and consider more idiomatic expressions in a few places.\n\nThe translation would be well‑understood by the target audience and serves its purpose effectively.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18/20."
