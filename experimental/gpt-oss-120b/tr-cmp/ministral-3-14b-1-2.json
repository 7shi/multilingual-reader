    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original. The explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are understandable for readers with a basic to intermediate knowledge of AI. However, the presence of meta‑comments (e.g., “dependiendo del tono de Camille”, “Notes clave”) and a few untranslated French fragments (\"Le pré‑entraînement.\", \"D'accord.\") can interrupt the reading experience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, using appropriate colloquial and technical vocabulary. Minor awkward constructions appear, such as \"informaciones\" instead of \"información\", \"memoria de uso único\" and the literal rendering of some phrases (e.g., \"es una observación excelente, y es crucial entender cómo funciona esto\"). The mixture of bold/italic markup does not affect fluency but the occasional literal calque from French feels slightly stiff.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled very well: *pre‑training* → \"preentrenamiento\", *fine‑tuning* → \"afinamiento\", ICL → \"aprendizaje por contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\", etc. The translator kept terminology consistent throughout. The only drawbacks are the leftover French words (\"Le pré‑entraînement\", \"D'accord\") and the decision to leave \"prompt\" in English, which could have been rendered as \"entrada\" or \"indicación\".",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone (explanatory, comparative) and the pedagogical analogies. Cultural adaptation is adequate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The inclusion of extra explanatory notes (e.g., \"dependiendo del tono de Camille\") is unnecessary and slightly breaks immersion. Untranslated French interjections also detract from a fully adapted text.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present: the distinction between pre‑training and fine‑tuning, the concept of transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent nature of knowledge, and the description of \"memory\" features. No major ideas are omitted, and the added notes do not remove any content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and technically sound. It conveys the core concepts clearly and uses appropriate Spanish terminology for AI. Minor issues such as leftover French fragments, occasional unnatural phrasing, and unnecessary meta‑comments prevent it from being perfect, but the text remains highly usable for its intended audience.\nScore (average of the criteria): 16.4 ≈ 16/20."
