  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is overall easy to follow. Sentences are mostly clear and the logical flow mirrors the original French dialogue. A few long sentences could be split for better clarity, but readers can understand the concepts without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally, but there are several awkward constructions (e.g., “encadenamiento (la entrada de usuario a la IA)”, “aprendizaje interactivo contextual”, “fondeo”). Inconsistent switching between Spanish and English terms also creates a slightly stilted feel for native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled inconsistently. \"Grounding\" is rendered as \"fondeo\", which is misleading. \"In‑Context Learning\" becomes \"AIC (Aprendizaje Interactivo Contextual)\" – a term that does not exist in the community. Some English words (fine‑tuning, ICL) are left untranslated while others are translated, leading to confusion. Overall, the terminology could be more accurate and uniform.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original intent and tone, and the cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The main shortcoming is the mis‑translation of a few key technical concepts, which slightly weakens the adaptation but does not alter the overall message.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No substantive information is omitted, though the inaccurate term substitutions affect precision.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core ideas of the podcast accurately and is generally readable. However, inconsistencies and inaccuracies in technical terminology (especially \"grounding\" → \"fondeo\" and the creation of a non‑standard acronym AIC) detract from its professionalism. Improving term consistency and choosing more idiomatic Spanish equivalents would raise both fluency and terminology scores.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
