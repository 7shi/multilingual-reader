  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly clear and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. A few minor hiccups (e.g., \"Tecnología Claro\" instead of a more natural \"Tecnología Clara\") do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, but there are occasional literal renderings that feel slightly stiff (e.g., \"el concepto de « anclaje » (grounding)\" and the repetition \"Aprendizaje en Contexto (en inglés, In-Context Learning)\"), as well as a few overly long sentences. Native speakers would find it smooth but not perfectly idiomatic.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"pre-entrenamiento\" → \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\" → \"ajuste fino\", \"transfer learning\" → \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"in‑context learning\" → \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", and \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\". Consistency is maintained and the terms are appropriate for a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original podcast format and retains the French brand name, adding a helpful parenthetical translation. Cultural references are neutral, so no major mismatches. Some phrasing could be more adapted to Spanish‑speaking listeners, but the intent and tone are preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the notion of temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of the “memory” feature. No substantive information is lost, and redundancy is kept to a minimum.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency could be polished slightly to sound more natural in Spanish. Contextual adaptation is adequate, and no important information is omitted. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking tech‑focused audience.\n\n**Total score:** 85/100 (sum of the five criteria)."
