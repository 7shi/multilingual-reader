  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia y aprendizaje en contexto are explained with clear analogies. Minor hiccups (e.g., occasional long sentences) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native speaker overall. Most idioms and expressions are well‑chosen, but a few formulations are slightly clunky (e.g., \"partes de un contexto vacío\" instead of \"empiezas con un contexto vacío\"). The occasional over‑literal rendering of French‑style exclamations (\"¡Exactamente!\", \"¡Una analogía perfecta!\") is acceptable but slightly stiff.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje, memoria, etc. The terms are consistent throughout and match the level expected for a podcast audience. No mistranslations of key concepts were found.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural references are neutral, and the speaker‑style (conversational, enthusiastic) is kept. Small French‑style constructions are adapted naturally to Spanish, so the message reaches the target audience effectively.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is retained. No sentences or ideas were omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as in the source. Redundancies are not introduced, and the content stays concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content clearly, uses appropriate terminology, and reads naturally for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve flow, but the translation faithfully represents the original while being fully understandable.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18 out of 20."
