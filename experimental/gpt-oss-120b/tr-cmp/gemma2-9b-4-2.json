  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly understandable and the flow of the dialogue is preserved, but several interruptions (e.g., the inserted note “Here are some improved translations…”, leftover French words such as *donc* and *Ce serait*, and occasional formal wording like “Mire usted”) make it harder for a typical listener to follow smoothly. These issues lower the overall readability.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are noticeable unnatural expressions: the formal “Mire usted”, the use of “conexión” for the technical term *grounding*, and the presence of untranslated French fragments. Such slips would sound odd to native speakers and break the natural podcast rhythm.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, memoria de uso único). The only minor inconsistency is the translation of *grounding* as “conexión” rather than a more precise term like “anclaje”. Overall the terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally respects the original intent and the podcast style, but the inclusion of translator notes and residual French expressions shows insufficient adaptation to the target audience. Cultural and stylistic adaptation could be tighter.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key ideas from the original script are present; no major content is omitted. The extraneous note adds noise but does not delete information. Hence completeness is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the substance of the French podcast and conveys the technical explanations clearly. However, it is marred by leftover French words, an unnecessary translator’s note, and occasional stiff phrasing. Cleaning these artifacts and choosing more natural Spanish expressions would raise the quality substantially, especially for a spoken‑word format like a podcast.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14.0/20."
