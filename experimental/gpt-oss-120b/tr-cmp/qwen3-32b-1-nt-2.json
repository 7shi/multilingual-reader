  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are clear. A few sentences are long, which slightly hampers quick comprehension, but overall the reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part and uses appropriate colloquial expressions (e.g., \"¡Una analogía perfecta!\", \"Es una excelente observación\"). Minor awkwardness appears with the choice of \"afinamiento\" for fine‑tuning and a couple of slightly clunky constructions, but they do not break the flow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\", \"anclaje\". The only point of contention is \"afinamiento\", which is less common than \"ajuste fino\" or \"fine‑tuning\", yet it remains understandable and consistent throughout the text.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original intent to a Spanish‑speaking audience effectively. Cultural references are neutral, and the tone of a podcast script is preserved. Minor improvements could be made in word choice to better match everyday Spanish usage, but the overall adaptation is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is retained. No ideas are omitted, and the supplementary explanations (e.g., analogies) are faithfully reproduced. The translation is neither redundant nor lacking important details.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational style of the podcast, and is largely clear and natural for Spanish readers. Minor issues such as the choice of \"afinamiento\" instead of a more idiomatic term and occasional long sentences prevent a perfect score, but they do not detract significantly from the usefulness of the translation."
