  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the technical concepts are explained clearly. Minor issues such as gender agreement (\"bienvenido\" instead of \"bienvenida\") do not significantly hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native Spanish speaker, but there are a few stylistic hiccups (e.g., \"¡Exactamente. Y este aprendizaje…\" could be smoother, and occasional punctuation choices feel slightly off). Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely well‑handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\". However, the term \"afilado\" is introduced later for fine‑tuning, creating inconsistency, and the abbreviation changes from ICL to LCI, which is inaccurate. These inconsistencies lower the score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references and idiomatic expressions appropriately (e.g., \"consultor\" instead of \"consultant\"). The overall intent and tone of the original podcast script are preserved, making it suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French are present; no major information is omitted. The only slight deviation is the mistaken abbreviation (ICL → LCI), which does not remove content but alters terminology.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality and conveys the original content effectively. The main drawbacks are minor terminology inconsistencies and a few stylistic quirks. With a bit of polishing—standardising \"ajuste fino\" throughout and correcting the ICL abbreviation—the text would be excellent.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 17/20."
