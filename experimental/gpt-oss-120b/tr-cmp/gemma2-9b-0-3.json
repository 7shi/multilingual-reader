  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally clear and easy to follow. The main ideas are conveyed without ambiguity, and the conversational flow mirrors the original French script. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., \"los palabras\", \"esas conocimientos\") do not impede comprehension, but they slightly affect smoothness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the text reads naturally for the most part, several lexical choices sound odd to a native Spanish speaker: \"afianzamiento\" for fine‑tuning, \"fundamentación\" for grounding, and a few gender/number mismatches. These reduce the naturalness of the language.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ICL\" and \"prompt\" are kept correctly. However, the translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"afianzamiento\" is not the standard term (\"ajuste fino\" would be expected), and \"anclaje\" would be more appropriate than \"fundamentación\". The inconsistency slightly harms terminology accuracy.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational style. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogies (consultant, bike‑riding, exam cramming) work well in Spanish. The only drawback is the occasional use of less idiomatic wording, but overall the adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No sentences or concepts are omitted, and the sequence of ideas remains intact. Minor typographical errors do not delete content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does an excellent job of transmitting the content and pedagogical tone of the original podcast. It is largely readable and complete, but it suffers from a few non‑standard lexical choices and small grammatical errors that affect fluency and technical precision. A revision of the key technical terms (using \"ajuste fino\" and \"anclaje\") and correction of gender/number mismatches would raise the quality to a near‑native level.\nOverall score (average of the criteria): 16.2 ≈ 16/20."
