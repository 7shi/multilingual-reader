  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto) are clear. A few long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part and uses appropriate colloquial phrasing (e.g., “como contratar a un consultor brillante”). There are a handful of slightly awkward constructions – \"El aprendizaje en contexto es memorizar para un examen\" and \"funcionalidades como la « Memoria » que algunas IA comienzan a integrar\" – which a native speaker would likely rephrase, but they do not break the flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL*, *grounding* rendered as *anclaje*. The translation keeps terminology consistent throughout and provides parenthetical explanations where needed, matching the source’s level of detail.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts cultural references and the podcast tone to Spanish well. Expressions such as \"como contratar a un consultor brillante\" and \"una hoja de trucos\" fit Spanish‑speaking audiences. Minor opportunities for deeper localization (e.g., using \"incorporar\" instead of \"comenzar a integrar\") exist, but the overall intent and register are preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the translation does not add irrelevant material. The dialogue flow and the logical progression of ideas are maintained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, retains the conversational style of the podcast, and is largely clear and natural for Spanish readers. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but the text is fully understandable and technically sound.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.2 ≈ 18/20."
