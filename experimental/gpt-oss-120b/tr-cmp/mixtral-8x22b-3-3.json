  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the concepts are explained clearly. Sentences are mostly short and easy to follow, making the content accessible to the target audience. Minor hiccups (e.g., “el afino (fine‑tuning)”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but a few expressions feel awkward or literal: \"el afino\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\", the switch from ICL to \"ACL\", and occasional word order that feels translated rather than idiomatic. These reduce the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly – pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, grounding – but some choices are sub‑optimal. \"Afino\" and \"ACL\" are not standard in Spanish AI literature, and \"enraizamiento\" is rarely used for \"grounding\" (\"anclaje\" would be better). Consistency could be improved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts metaphors well (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", \"una antisècha\"). Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience, and the explanatory tone is maintained.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent knowledge distinction, and the explanation of \"memoria\" features. No significant information is lost.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is generally clear and faithful to the original, conveying the technical discussion effectively. Fluency and terminology could be refined – especially the use of standard AI vocabulary in Spanish – to make the text feel more natural to native readers. Overall, it is a solid translation with minor stylistic issues that can be easily corrected.\n\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 83/100."
