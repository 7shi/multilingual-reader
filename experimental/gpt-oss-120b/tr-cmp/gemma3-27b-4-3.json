  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original. Most sentences are understandable, but occasional literal translations (e.g., “Pre‑capacitación” instead of “preentrenamiento”, “optimización” for fine‑tuning) introduce slight confusion for readers not familiar with those terms. Overall, a native speaker can grasp the content without major effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound a bit awkward or redundant: “aprendizaje puntual” for “bachotage”, “insertar automáticamente estos extractos de forma automática”, and the repeated definition of ICL. The lexical choice is mostly appropriate, yet the prose lacks the smoothness of a native‑written script.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is largely correct – “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana contextual”, “anclaje”. The main weakness is the translation of “fine‑tuning” as “optimización”, which is not the standard term (normally “ajuste fino”). Consistency is otherwise good.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts the podcast name to “Tech al Instante”, which fits Spanish‑speaking audiences. Minor issues like “aprendizaje puntual” slightly reduce naturalness, but the cultural adaptation is satisfactory.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the concepts, examples, and analogies from the French script are present. No significant information is lost; only some redundancy and minor phrasing quirks appear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original material accurately and keeps the educational tone of the podcast. While the meaning is fully retained, the text would benefit from more idiomatic phrasing and the use of standard technical terms (e.g., “preentrenamiento” and “ajuste fino”). After addressing these points, the version would read as a natural, fluent Spanish podcast script.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
