  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are easy to follow. Sentences are mostly short and clear, and the podcast‑style explanations are preserved. Minor issues such as the uncommon use of “afinamiento” instead of the more usual “ajuste fino” do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, but there are occasional awkward choices: “Usted lo tiene claro” feels overly formal for a conversational podcast, the English term “cheat sheet” is left untranslated, and the mix of “usted” with the informal tone creates a slight inconsistency. Nevertheless, a native speaker would understand without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, and the abbreviation “ICL” are correctly rendered. The only slight deviation is the use of “afinamiento” rather than the more common “ajuste fino”, but the meaning remains clear and consistent throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and podcast atmosphere. However, the shift between formal “Usted” and the otherwise informal style, as well as the retention of the English phrase “cheat sheet”, reduces cultural adaptation slightly. A fully consistent register would improve the reader’s connection.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present. No ideas are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue. The only addition is the English “cheat sheet”, which, while not translated, still conveys the intended meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the technical content clearly. Readability and terminology are strong points. Fluency and contextual adaptation could be refined by using a consistent informal register and translating remaining English borrowings. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nOverall score (sum of the five criteria): 86 / 100."
