  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally clear and the ideas are easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can understand. A few sentences are a bit long or overly literal (e.g., “una nueva aproximación más flexible está surgiendo”), which slightly hampers smooth reading, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward turns that betray the source‑language structure: \"una nueva aproximación más flexible está surgiendo\" (instead of \"está surgiendo una nueva aproximación más flexible\"), \"Aprendizaje en Contexto (ACL)\" (the correct abbreviation is ICL), and occasional literal translations such as \"una astucia\" for \"una jugada astuta\". Vocabulary is appropriate, yet the occasional clunky phrasing reduces overall fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, afinamiento (fine‑tuning) and anclaje (grounding) are all present and consistent. The main drawback is the wrong abbreviation for in‑context learning (ACL instead of ICL) and the use of \"entrenamiento ajustado\" which, while understandable, is not the most common Spanish rendering of \"fine‑tuning\". Overall terminology is solid but not perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue, using familiar Spanish expressions (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", \"una anécdota de bachotaje\"). Cultural references are neutral, so no misunderstandings arise. Minor phrasing issues exist, but the adaptation is effective and the message is conveyed appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is retained. No key ideas are omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as in the original. The only minor discrepancy is the incorrect acronym, which does not delete content but could cause confusion. Otherwise, the translation is complete.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is a solid, faithful rendering of the original French podcast script. It conveys the technical content accurately and keeps the conversational style, making the material accessible to Spanish listeners. Minor issues—primarily the wrong abbreviation for in‑context learning and a few slightly stiff sentences—prevent it from being completely natural, but these do not detract significantly from overall comprehension.\n\nOverall the work demonstrates good competence in both linguistic and technical domains, with room for polishing fluency and terminology consistency.\n\nScore (average): 17/20"
