  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but many sentences are overly long and contain redundant repetitions (e.g., the same explanation of pre‑entrenamiento appears twice). This makes the flow harder to follow, especially for listeners reading a transcript.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural or overly formal for a podcast script: \"Usted lo ha comprendido todo\", \"ancoraje\" (instead of \"anclaje\"), inconsistent use of \"¡\" and spacing, and duplicated filler phrases. These issues break the natural conversational tone expected in Spanish.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly correctly rendered (preentrenamiento, ajuste, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL). The only notable slip is the translation of \"grounding\" as \"ancoraje\", which is not the usual term in Spanish technical literature. Overall terminology handling is solid.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent but adds extra explanatory clauses that were not in the source (e.g., \"Es importante destacar...\", \"Es una excelente observación\"). While these do not distort meaning, they make the text feel less faithful to the original conversational style and occasionally introduce a more formal register.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key ideas from the French script are present: pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto, la diferencia entre memoria temporal y permanente, y la explicación de las funciones de \"memoria\". No major information is lost; only minor stylistic expansions are added.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and preserves most of the original information, but the style is cumbersome and occasionally unidiomatic for a spoken‑language podcast. Reducing redundancy, smoothing conversational phrasing, and using more common technical vocabulary (e.g., \"anclaje\" instead of \"ancoraje\") would greatly improve readability and fluency.\n\nOverall, the translation is functionally correct but needs polishing to reach a native‑speaker level of naturalness and clarity.\n\nScore: 72/100 (average 14.4/20)."
