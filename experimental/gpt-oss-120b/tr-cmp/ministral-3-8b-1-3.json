    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The overall story is recognizable and the main ideas can be followed, but numerous grammatical mistakes, gender‑agreement errors and odd word choices (e.g., *las informaciones*, *el IA*, *las nuevas conocimientos*) interrupt the flow. Some sentences are incomplete (\"Camille: we\", \"Luc: we simply provide the documents.\") which forces the reader to guess the missing content. Consequently, a Spanish‑speaking reader can understand the gist but must work around many hiccups.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural constructions and outright errors: \"una área específica\" (should be *un área*), \"el afinado\" (rare, should be *ajuste fino*), \"las respuestas del IA\" (gender mismatch), and repetitive or clumsy phrasing such as \"el modelo en sí no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus conversaciones\" that feels forced. The mix of formal and informal registers is inconsistent, and the presence of untranslated English/French fragments breaks the naturalness. Overall the text does not read like a smooth native‑speaker podcast script.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly preserved (preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, grounding). However, some terms are rendered incorrectly or inconsistently (\"afinado\" instead of the more common *ajuste fino*, \"memoria a corto plazo\" is fine, but \"informaciones\" is not the usual term for *information*). The occasional misuse of gender and plural forms for nouns like *conocimientos* and *información* shows a lack of careful handling of terminology. The terminology is acceptable but not fully accurate.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator attempted to adapt the register to a conversational podcast style, but the execution is uneven. Cultural references are mostly kept, yet several literal translations sound odd in Spanish (e.g., \"es como enviar a este graduado a especializarse en una área específica\"). Moreover, leftover French/English fragments indicate incomplete adaptation. The overall intent is conveyed, but the adaptation is marred by linguistic inaccuracies.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, temporary vs. permanent memory, and the “memory” feature trick. Nonetheless, two dialogue lines are completely missing (\"Camille: we\" and \"Luc: we simply provide the documents.\") and some nuances are lost or distorted by incorrect wording. The core information is there, but the omissions and errors reduce completeness.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the skeleton of the original podcast script and retains most of the technical concepts, but it suffers from serious linguistic flaws. Frequent grammar mistakes, gender mismatches, unnatural phrasing, and a few untranslated fragments hinder readability and fluency. Terminology is largely correct but inconsistently applied, and cultural adaptation is only partially successful. While the essential information is conveyed, the translation would need a thorough revision by a native‑speaking editor to become a polished, listener‑ready Spanish version of the podcast.\n\n**Total score (out of 100): 49**"
