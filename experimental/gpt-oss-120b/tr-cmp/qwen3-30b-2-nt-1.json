    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can understand. Some long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but comprehension is not impeded.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, using idiomatic Spanish vocabulary (e.g., “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”). A few literal renderings feel slightly awkward (“su espacio de trabajo temporal ha sido simplemente vacío”, “refinamiento” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”), which prevents a fully native feel.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, grounding → anclaje, etc. The choice of “refinamiento” for fine‑tuning is understandable but not the most common term in Spanish technical literature, which slightly reduces consistency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral, and the examples remain relevant for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor literalism does not affect the overall message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is retained. No major ideas are omitted, and the explanations of memory, ICL vs. fine‑tuning, and the “memoria” feature are fully conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and faithful. It communicates the technical discussion clearly, with only a few lexical choices that could be refined for greater naturalness. The reader will grasp the distinction between temporary in‑context learning and permanent fine‑tuning without confusion. Minor stylistic tweaks (splitting long sentences, using more common terminology) would raise the quality to near‑native level.\nScore breakdown: Readability 16, Fluency 15, Terminology 14, Contextual Adaptation 17, Information Completeness 18. Total 80/100.\nThe translation is suitable for a podcast audience and successfully adapts the French content to Spanish while preserving nuance and technical accuracy."
