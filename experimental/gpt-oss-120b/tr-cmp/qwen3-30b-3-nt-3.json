  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow; sentences are logical and concepts are explained clearly. Minor punctuation issues (e.g., missing opening exclamation marks) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are occasional awkward constructions and a mix of formal \"usted\" with informal podcast tone. Some phrases could be smoother (e.g., \"vincular las respuestas de la IA a la información\" → \"vincular las respuestas de la IA con la información\").",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally well‑handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\" are appropriate. However, \"fine‑tuning\" is left untranslated and \"grounding\" becomes \"anclaje\", which, while understandable, is not the most common Spanish term (\"anclaje\" is acceptable but less precise). Consistency could be improved.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast’s explanatory and conversational intent, adapting cultural references appropriately. The only drawback is the occasional mismatch in register (formal vs. informal) which slightly reduces the natural feel for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present; no ideas are omitted or added unnecessarily. The content remains concise and faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the original content effectively. Readability and completeness are strong points. Fluency and terminology could be polished further, especially by adopting more consistent Spanish technical vocabularies and smoothing the register to match the informal podcast style. The translation would be well‑understood by Spanish speakers, though a native‑level edit could raise its naturalness to near‑perfect level.\n\nTotal score (out of 100): 85"
