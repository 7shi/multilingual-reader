    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. Most sentences convey the original ideas, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained clearly. However, occasional French fragments (e.g., “C’est tout à fait ça.”) and minor grammatical slips slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several unnatural expressions: mixed French/Spanish words (\"C’est tout à fait ça\", \"On puede decir eso\", \"C’est donc una memoria\"), the use of \"Ustedes han comprendido todo\" which sounds forced, and occasional punctuation issues. While a native reader can follow the dialogue, the translation does not consistently sound like natural spoken Spanish.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\". The term \"grounding\" is left as the French \"ancrage\" in parentheses, which may confuse readers. Consistency is good but the few untranslated French terms reduce the overall adequacy.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The podcast tone and explanatory style are kept, and cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Nevertheless, the presence of untranslated French words and occasional literal translations (e.g., \"consultor brillante\" for \"brilliant consultant\") slightly weaken the adaptation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning, the concept of grounding, the temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of \"memoria\" features. Only minor omissions (the untranslated French sentence) are noted, but no substantive content is lost.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core content and retains the educational podcast format, but it suffers from several lexical and grammatical inconsistencies due to leftover French fragments and occasional awkward phrasing. Technical terminology is largely correct, though the mixed‑language handling of \"grounding\"/\"ancrage\" could be improved. With a careful edit to remove French remnants and smooth out idiomatic Spanish, the translation would reach a much higher level of naturalness and readability.\nOverall score: 73/100.\n\n**Strengths**: good coverage of concepts, accurate technical terms, maintains the conversational structure.\n**Weaknesses**: residual French text, some unnatural expressions, inconsistent handling of specialized vocabularies.\n**Recommendation**: perform a thorough copy‑edit focusing on language consistency and native‑speaker phrasing, and translate all remaining French terms into Spanish equivalents."
