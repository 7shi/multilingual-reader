  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version uses clear, straightforward sentences that convey the podcast dialogue without ambiguity. Complex AI concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, y aprendizaje en contexto are explained with simple analogies (e.g., graduate, consultant) that are easy for a non‑expert audience to follow. Minor long sentences could be split for easier reading, but overall the text is comprehensible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural to a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and the style matches a conversational podcast. A few expressions feel slightly literal (“Lo has entendido todo”, “una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”), but they do not break fluency. Overall the flow is smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are correctly rendered. The choice of \"afinamiento\" for \"fine‑tuning\" is understandable, though the more common \"ajuste fino\" could be preferred. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the French cultural references (e.g., podcast intro, informal banter) appropriately for Spanish‑speaking listeners. No French‑specific idioms are left untranslated, and the analogies (consultant, bike‑riding) work equally well in Spanish. The tone remains engaging and suitable for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original script is present in the Spanish version. No sentences or key ideas are omitted, and the logical order is preserved. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy, keeping the content concise while retaining all nuances.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate, clear, and largely natural. It conveys the technical discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning in a way that is accessible to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor lexical choices (e.g., \"afinamiento\" vs. \"ajuste fino\") and a few slightly literal phrases prevent a perfect score, but they do not hinder understanding. Overall, the work demonstrates a high level of proficiency in both languages and in handling technical content.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18/20"
