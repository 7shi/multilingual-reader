    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the main ideas are clear. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en”, “a un entrenamiento”, typo “francque”) slightly hinder smooth reading, but they do not block comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several awkward or inconsistent expressions: the mix of ‘tú’ and ‘usted’, the isolated word “Voy.” for “I see”, and phrasing such as “Imagínense que se envía una IA… a un entrenamiento”. These make the translation feel less natural to native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding, prompt, etc. The terminology is consistent and appropriate for a tech‑savvy audience. The only flaw is a typographical error (“francque”).",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast tone and the explanatory style of the original. Minor issues appear in register (formal ‘usted’ vs informal tone) and in a few literal renderings that could be smoother, but the intent and purpose are well conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the points made in the French script are present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted. The only loss of nuance is the truncated “Voy.” which does not fully convey “I see.”, but overall the content remains complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the educational spirit of the original podcast and accurately conveys the technical content. It is largely complete and uses appropriate terminology. However, fluency suffers from several unnatural phrasings, register inconsistencies, and a few typographical errors, which prevent it from feeling fully native. Improving these stylistic aspects would raise the overall quality significantly.\n\nStrengths: correct technical vocabulary, faithful conveyance of ideas, generally clear structure.\nWeaknesses: occasional awkward wording, mixed formal/informal address, minor typos, and an odd isolated sentence (“Voy.”).\nOverall, the translation is good but needs polishing for native fluency and consistency.\n\nScore out of 20 (average of criteria): 16"
