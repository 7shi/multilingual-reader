    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand and follows a logical flow. Most sentences convey the original ideas clearly, but there are occasional awkward constructions (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en…”, “Véase:”) that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural for native speakers: mixing formal \"Usted\" with informal \"tú\", odd word order (“Le dar simplemente”), and leaving the French word \"antisèche\" untranslated. Punctuation around exclamation marks is also inconsistent.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"grounding\" (as \"anclaje\") are correctly rendered. However, the term \"prompt\" is kept in English and \"antisèche\" remains in French, showing slight inconsistency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, but the shift from a conversational, informal French tone to a more formal Spanish tone (use of \"Usted\") reduces the natural podcast feel. Cultural nuances are largely retained, but the tone adaptation could be better.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original script is present; no major ideas are omitted. The only loss is the untranslated \"antisèche\", which may cause a brief moment of confusion for Spanish readers.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the content and technical explanations accurately, but it suffers from several fluency and tone issues that make it feel slightly stilted. The handling of terminology is solid, though a few loanwords should have been adapted. Minor adjustments—especially consistent pronoun use, translating all French terms, and smoothing awkward phrasing—would bring the translation to a higher level of naturalness and readability.\nOverall score (out of 100): 76/100."
