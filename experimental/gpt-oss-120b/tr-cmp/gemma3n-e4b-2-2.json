  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is overall clear and the dialogue flows logically, allowing readers to follow the technical discussion. However, the opening line mixes French and Spanish (\"Bonjour y bienvenido\"), and occasional mismatches of pronouns (\"sus\" vs. \"vuestras\") slightly disrupt comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural, but a few expressions are awkward or redundant (e.g., \"se inserta automáticamente estos extractos en el prompt, de forma automática\", \"el modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de vuestras conversaciones\"). Minor punctuation issues (missing inverted exclamation marks) also affect native‑speaker fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are correctly rendered and used consistently. The occasional retention of English words like \"prompt\" is acceptable in a tech‑focused context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and purpose, but cultural/linguistic adaptation is imperfect in places (the mixed \"Bonjour y bienvenido\", inconsistent use of \"sus\"/\"vuestras\"). These choices slightly reduce the naturalness for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas, analogies, and examples from the French script are present. No significant information is omitted, and the explanations remain faithful to the source. Redundancies are minimal and do not hinder understanding.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content of the podcast, preserving most of the nuance and examples. Minor linguistic slips—especially the mixed‑language greeting, occasional pronoun inconsistency, and a few redundant or awkward phrasing—prevent it from reaching the highest level of polish. Overall, it is a competent and accurate translation that would be easily understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts, though a quick edit could improve fluency and cultural adaptation.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
