  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow; the main ideas and analogies are preserved and the sentence flow is logical. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en”, “las conocimientos”, “bachotar”) slightly hinder smooth reading but do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural to a native speaker: the preposition in the greeting, the verb ‘bachotar’, the agreement error in ‘las conocimientos’, and awkward phrasing such as ‘la IA no está constantemente refinada’. Despite these issues, the text reads relatively fluently overall.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL* and *grounding* are correctly translated or left in the original when appropriate. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish, using culturally appropriate equivalents (e.g., “consultor brillante”, “hoja de trucos”). Minor lapses like ‘antiespia’ instead of a more natural phrase slightly reduce the adaptation quality, but the intent and register are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present. No major ideas are omitted, and the examples (English‑French transfer, memory vs. fine‑tuning) remain intact. Small wording errors do not lead to loss of meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast’s concepts accurately and retains most of its pedagogical tone. While the terminology and completeness are strong, fluency suffers from a handful of grammatical and lexical inaccuracies that make the text feel slightly stilted for native Spanish speakers. Overall, it is a solid translation that would benefit from a careful proofread to polish the awkward phrases and agreement errors.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16.8 ≈ 17/20."
