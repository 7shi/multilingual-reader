  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are broken down similarly to the original, and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, transfer learning, and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can understand. A few sentences feel a bit wordy (e.g., “Se puede tener una conversación larga y detallada…”), but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most of the text, but there are a few awkward or uncommon expressions. \"Aprendizaje puntual\" for \"In‑Context Learning\" is not a standard term in Spanish AI literature; native speakers would expect \"aprendizaje en contexto\". The switch from \"ajuste fino\" to \"optimización\" later in the script creates inconsistency. Small stylistic issues (e.g., “memorización” instead of the more common “memoria” for the feature) make the text feel slightly forced in places.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"transferencia de aprendizaje\", \"ventana contextual\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" (as \"fundamentación\"). However, the inconsistency between \"ajuste fino\" and later \"optimización\" may confuse readers. The translation also introduces a neologism \"aprendizaje puntual\" that is not widely used, which slightly harms term consistency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the content well to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are kept neutral, and the tone remains conversational. The use of \"consultor brillante\" and \"experto permanente\" mirrors the original metaphor. Minor lapses (e.g., the unusual \"aprendizaje puntual\") do not severely affect the overall intent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the examples (English‑French transfer, memory feature) are kept. Redundancies are minimal, and the translation does not add unnecessary information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and maintains a clear, engaging style. The main weaknesses lie in a few non‑standard term choices and slight inconsistencies in terminology, which slightly affect fluency and technical precision. With minor adjustments—using \"aprendizaje en contexto\" consistently and keeping \"ajuste fino\" throughout—the translation would be excellent for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nFinal score (average): 17/20."
