    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the original dialogue structure. However, several sentences are overly long, contain repetitive clauses, and some wording is clunky (e.g., \"marca de memoria a corto plazo\" instead of the more common \"ventana de contexto\"). The duplication of paragraphs makes it harder for the reader to keep track of the flow, lowering overall comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are numerous unnatural expressions and grammatical slips: \"Camille imagina una IA...\" mixes speakers, \"el preentrenamiento\" is fine but later \"pre-entrenamiento\" is used inconsistently, and phrases like \"el propio modelo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de vuestras conversaciones\" sound forced. The translation sounds like a literal, machine‑generated draft rather than a smooth native‑speaker text.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly present (pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, grounding), but their handling is inconsistent. \"Grounding\" is left as \"anclaje\" without explanation, and \"ventana de contexto\" is replaced by the less common \"marca de memoria a corto plazo\". Some English acronyms are kept without Spanish equivalents, which may confuse a non‑technical audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue, but it adds redundant explanations and repeats whole sections, which does not improve cultural relevance. Minor adaptations (e.g., using \"Buenos días\" instead of \"Bonjour\") are correct, yet the overall presentation feels bloated and less engaging for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French script are conveyed: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the pseudo‑memory feature. No crucial information is omitted, though the repeated passages make the text longer than necessary.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the full content of the original podcast and is largely understandable, but it suffers from redundancy, occasional mistranslations of technical jargon, and a lack of natural flow. A thorough edit to remove duplicated paragraphs, streamline sentence structure, and ensure consistent terminology would raise the quality considerably."
