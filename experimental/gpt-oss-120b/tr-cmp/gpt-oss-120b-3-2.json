  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained clearly. A few long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part and uses appropriate vocabulary. Minor awkwardness appears with loanwords like «bachotage» (a French term left untranslated) and the phrase «memoria de uso único», which are understandable but not the most idiomatic Spanish. Otherwise the flow is smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, etc. The translator kept the original English/French terms in parentheses where helpful, aiding reader understanding. No major terminology errors.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the podcast tone, uses colloquial but appropriate Spanish (e.g., «chuleta», «consultor»). Cultural references are kept neutral, and the intent of the original is preserved. The only slight issue is the use of «bachotage», which may not be familiar to all Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No omissions or distortions are detected; supplemental explanations are faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational style of the podcast, and is largely readable and natural. Minor lexical choices (e.g., retaining the French word «bachotage» and a slightly stilted phrase «memoria de uso único») prevent a perfect score, but they do not hinder understanding. The translator demonstrates solid command of both languages and the subject matter.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18.4 → rounded to 19/20."
