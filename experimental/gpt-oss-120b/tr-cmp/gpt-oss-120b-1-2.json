  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are clear. Minor hiccups such as occasional long sentences or a few redundant connectors do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and the dialogue flows smoothly. A few expressions are slightly odd (e.g., \"memoria a corto plazo de la IA\" instead of \"memoria de corto plazo\" and the colloquial \"chuleta\"), but they do not break fluency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\" (although \"ajuste fino\" is more common), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". Consistency is maintained throughout the script. The only drawback is the choice of \"afinamiento\" which is less usual in Spanish technical literature.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts cultural references well. The use of \"pódcast\" and the informal \"chuleta\" shows an attempt to sound conversational, though \"chuleta\" may be region‑specific (Argentina) and could alienate other Spanish‑speaking audiences. Overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and nuances from the French source are present. No major information is omitted, and the order of the dialogue is kept intact. The explanation of memory functions and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge is fully retained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, reads smoothly, and respects the conversational tone of the original podcast. Minor issues are limited to a few lexical choices that could be refined for broader Spanish‑speaking audiences (e.g., preferring \"ajuste fino\" over \"afinamiento\" and using a more neutral term than \"chuleta\"). Overall, the work is clear, faithful, and engaging.\n\n**Strengths**: clear explanations, consistent terminology, faithful to the source, natural dialogue flow.\n**Areas for improvement**: adjust a couple of region‑specific colloquialisms and consider more standard technical vocabulary.\n\n**Total score (out of 100)**: 82"
