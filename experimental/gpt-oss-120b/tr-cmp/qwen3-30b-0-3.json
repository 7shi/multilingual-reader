  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas flow logically, making the technical discussion accessible. Minor issues such as the phrase \"montas en silla\" (instead of \"te subes a la bicicleta\") and occasional punctuation quirks slightly affect smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., \"montas en silla\", \"preentrenamiento\" without hyphen, and the handling of quotation marks). These do not impede understanding but betray a non‑native feel.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL), and \"anclaje\" for grounding. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience, though a few expressions could be refined for greater naturalness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present; no significant omissions or additions are detected. The content remains faithful to the original narrative.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality: it conveys the technical concepts clearly, uses appropriate terminology, and retains the conversational style of the podcast. Minor phrasing tweaks (especially \"montas en silla\") would improve fluency, but the text is fully understandable and faithful to the source.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 16, Fluency 15, Terminology 18, Contextual Adaptation 17, Information Completeness 19. Total: 85/100.\n\nRecommendations: replace \"montas en silla\" with \"te subes a la bicicleta\" or similar, smooth out punctuation around quotes, and consider hyphenating \"pre‑entrenamiento\" for consistency with common usage.\n\nOverall rating: 85/100, indicating a strong translation with room for minor refinements."
