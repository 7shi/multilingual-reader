  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. Sentences are generally clear, and complex concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can understand. Minor typographical issues (e.g., the duplicated \"Camille: Camille:\") slightly disrupt the smoothness but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, using appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic Spanish. There are a few awkward constructions – such as \"Mire:\" and the capitalised filler \"Mira:\" – which feel a bit stilted. The duplicated speaker label is also a small glitch. Overall, the language sounds native‑like with only occasional hiccups.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento (fine‑tuning)\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". The term \"prompt\" is left unchanged, which is common in Spanish technical discourse. No crucial term is mistranslated or omitted.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue, adapting cultural references appropriately (e.g., \"consultor brillante\"). Some literal renderings (e.g., \"Mire:\") feel slightly out of place in spoken Spanish, but the overall message and persuasive framing are intact.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are lost, and the examples (English‑to‑French transfer, memory feature) are fully retained. The only issue is a duplicated speaker tag, which is a formatting error rather than a loss of content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, uses suitable terminology, and is largely readable and fluent. Minor stylistic slips and a small formatting glitch prevent a perfect score, but the overall effectiveness of the translation is strong.\n\nStrengths: precise handling of technical jargon, clear exposition of concepts, faithful preservation of the original structure. \nAreas for improvement: smooth out filler expressions like \"Mire:\" and eliminate duplicated speaker labels to enhance polish.\n\nOverall, the translation would serve Spanish‑speaking listeners of the podcast very well.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 90"
