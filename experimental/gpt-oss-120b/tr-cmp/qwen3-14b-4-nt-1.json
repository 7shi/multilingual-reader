    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are generally short and the dialogue format is preserved, making the technical discussion accessible. Minor hiccups (e.g., occasional missing articles) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, but there are a few literal renderings that feel slightly off for native speakers: “aprendizaje transferido” instead of “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “la totalidad del historial de su conversación constituye el contexto” (should be “constituyen”). These occasional awkward phrases lower the overall smoothness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely kept, but some are not the most common Spanish equivalents. “preentrenamiento” and “ajuste fino” are fine, yet “aprendizaje transferido” is uncommon; the standard term is “aprendizaje por transferencia”. The acronym ICL is retained correctly, and “grounding” is rendered as “anclaje”, which is acceptable. Consistency is good, but the non‑standard term prevents a higher score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original podcast tone, keeps the informal yet informative style, and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., “Hola y bienvenidos”). No French‑specific idioms remain, and the Spanish version feels targeted to a Spanish‑speaking tech‑enthusiast audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No major pieces of information are omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as the source. Redundancies are minimal, and the content stays concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original content accurately and maintains the podcast’s engaging style. Minor issues with terminology (use of less‑common equivalents) and occasional awkward phrasing keep it from being flawless, but it is highly understandable and technically sound.\n\nStrengths: clear structure, faithful content, appropriate cultural adaptation. \nWeaknesses: non‑standard technical terms and a few literal constructions that slightly affect naturalness.\n\nThe translation would benefit from replacing \"aprendizaje transferido\" with \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and smoothing a couple of sentences, but it is otherwise strong.\n\nScore out of 20: 17"
