  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are clear and the concepts are explained in a way that a native reader can understand. There are a few minor grammatical slips (e.g., \"experto de vuestras datos\"), but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, using colloquial interjections like \"¡Exactamente!\" and appropriate podcast‑style language. Some constructions are slightly awkward or contain mismatched gender/number (\"vuestras datos\"), and a few phrases could be smoother, but overall fluency is good.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". The term \"fine‑tuning\" is translated as \"entrenamiento especializado\", which is acceptable. The word \"prompt\" is left untranslated, which is common in the field. Consistency is maintained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and informal podcast atmosphere. Cultural references are neutral and the style fits a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor regional choices (e.g., \"vuestra\") are noticeable but do not detract from the overall adaptation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No key ideas or examples are omitted. The only issues are small linguistic errors, not content loss.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality and conveys the technical discussion clearly. It could be improved by fixing a few grammatical mismatches and polishing some slightly clunky phrases, but the meaning, tone, and technical accuracy are well preserved.\n\nScore breakdown: readability 16, fluency 15, terminology 18, contextual adaptation 17, information completeness 18. The average yields a solid 17 out of 20 for the whole translation.\n\nRecommended actions: correct gender/number agreement (e.g., \"sus datos\"), adjust a few awkward constructions, and consider translating \"prompt\" to \"instrucción\" for full consistency.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
