  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. Most sentences flow logically, and a Spanish‑speaking listener can grasp the discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning. Minor hiccups such as “Hola y bienvenido para” and a few overly literal constructions slightly disrupt smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several unnatural expressions and inconsistencies in register. The translation mixes formal \"usted\" with informal dialogue, uses “Hola y bienvenido para” instead of \"para el\", and keeps English‑derived words like \"prompt\" unchanged. These issues make the dialogue feel less natural for native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well‑handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"anclaje\" are appropriate. The only minor drawback is the untranslated \"prompt\", which could have been rendered as \"entrada\" or explained, but overall the terminology is consistent and accurate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone of a podcast conversation, but it does not fully adapt the register to Spanish‑speaking audiences. The shift to a formal \"usted\" style feels out of place for a casual podcast, and a few literal translations (e.g., \"estudiar apresuradamente\") sound awkward. Cultural adaptation is adequate but could be smoother.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present. No key ideas, examples, or analogies are omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is preserved.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully transmits the full content and technical depth of the original French podcast script. It excels in completeness and accurate terminology, but it suffers from occasional fluency problems and register mismatches that make the dialogue feel less natural in Spanish. Minor stylistic adjustments (consistent informal tone, smoother phrasing, translating \"prompt\") would raise the overall quality considerably.\nOverall score (out of 100): 83."
