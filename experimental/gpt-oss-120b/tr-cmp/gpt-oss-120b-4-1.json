  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clearly presented. The flow of the conversation mirrors the original, and complex concepts are explained in an accessible way. However, there are a few typographical errors (e.g., “apriestar” instead of a correct verb, double opening question marks) that slightly disrupt smooth reading.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part and uses appropriate vocabulary for a podcast audience. Some sentences are a bit clunky (“apriestar para un examen”, “Es una excelente observación, y es crucial comprender cómo funciona”) and the punctuation with duplicated question marks feels unnatural, which prevents a perfect fluency rating.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje (grounding). The terminology is consistent throughout and matches what a Spanish‑speaking technical audience would expect.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal, conversational tone of the podcast and adapts cultural references appropriately. Minor issues such as the double question marks and a few slightly literal translations prevent a perfect score, but overall the intent and style are well conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No relevant detail is omitted, and the content remains faithful to the source while staying concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, this is a high‑quality translation that accurately conveys the technical content and conversational tone of the original podcast. The main weaknesses are a couple of typographical errors and occasional awkward phrasing, but these do not significantly hinder comprehension. The translator demonstrates solid command of both languages and the subject matter.\n\nScore (sum of criteria): 90/100"
