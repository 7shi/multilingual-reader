  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the complex ideas about pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained clearly. Minor typographic choices (French guillemets) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. There are a few slightly awkward constructions (e.g., \"una IA completamente nueva\", the introduction of the unfamiliar acronym AIC, and occasional English terms like \"prompt\"). Overall, a native Spanish speaker would find it smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally well‑handled: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, etc. The switch from ICL to the invented acronym AIC is inconsistent with the source and could confuse readers. Retaining \"prompt\" in English is acceptable but a Spanish equivalent would be preferable.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately. The consultant analogy and the discussion of memory features are conveyed correctly. The only slight mismatch is the use of French quotation marks, which are uncommon in Spanish publishing.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted or altered, and the logical flow of the dialogue is preserved.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, this is a high‑quality translation. It faithfully reproduces the original dialogue, keeps the technical explanations intact, and is largely readable and natural for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Minor issues—such as the unexpected AIC acronym, occasional Anglicisms, and typographic quirks—prevent it from being perfect but do not detract significantly from understanding.\n\nScore summary: Readability 18, Fluency 17, Terminology 16, Contextual Adaptation 18, Information Completeness 20. The average yields an overall rating of 18/20."
