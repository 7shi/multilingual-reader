    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original. Most sentences are understandable, but there are a few hiccups that can slightly impede smooth reading: the French interjection “¿C'est‑à‑dire?” is left untranslated, and the colloquial “bacharelarse” is odd. Nonetheless, a Spanish‑speaking listener can follow the discussion without major difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are occasional awkward constructions and inconsistent pronoun use (“tus” vs. “vuestras”). Phrases such as “contexto amplio” and “como bacharelarse” are not idiomatic. Overall the language is fluent enough for a podcast script, but it could be polished.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ICL”, “grounding”, etc. Some inconsistencies appear – “ventana de contexto” is introduced earlier but later replaced by “contexto amplio”, and the French term “C’est‑à‑dire?” remains. Still, the terminology is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using appropriate analogies and explanations. Minor issues such as leftover French words and mixed formal/informal pronouns reduce the cultural fit slightly, but the overall intent and tone are preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present. No significant information is omitted, and the added parenthetical clarification for fine‑tuning is helpful. The only minor deviation is an extra explanatory clause about learning from examples, which does not alter the meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. It succeeds in keeping the conversational tone of the podcast while transmitting the key concepts about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning. The main areas for improvement are cleaning up residual French fragments, standardising pronouns, and refining a few non‑idiomatic expressions. With those tweaks, the text would read as a completely natural Spanish podcast script.\nScore: 79/100"
