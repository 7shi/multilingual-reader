    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the ideas are clearly presented. Sentence structures are logical, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑specialist can grasp. A few sentences are long, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds largely natural and idiomatic. Most phrasing matches native‑speaker expectations. Small grammatical slips (e.g., \"las nuevas conocimientos\" instead of \"los nuevos conocimientos\", occasional missing articles) and occasional literal renderings prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered (preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje). The translator correctly adapts English terms to Spanish while keeping the meaning. One minor error in gender agreement (\"las nuevas conocimientos\") slightly hurts the rating.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The tone of a podcast dialogue is preserved, with appropriate Spanish interjections (¡Una perfecta analogía!) and culturally neutral examples. No French‑specific references are left untranslated, and the content is well‑suited to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original script is present. No sections are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The explanations of temporary vs. permanent knowledge, memory functions, and the consultant analogy are fully retained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the original message accurately, uses appropriate technical language, and is generally easy to read. Minor grammatical inconsistencies prevent it from being flawless, but the work is highly effective for the intended audience.\nScore: 18/20 (average of the five criteria)."
