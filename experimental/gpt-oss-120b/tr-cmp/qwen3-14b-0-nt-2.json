  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logical and the dialogue format is preserved, allowing readers to grasp the concepts without difficulty. Minor clunkiness (e.g., occasional long sentences) does not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few word choices feel unnatural for native speakers – notably “el afinado” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”, and occasional punctuation quirks. Overall the flow is good but not fully idiomatic.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly rendered (preentrenamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL). However, some terms are translated in a less standard way (“el afinado” for fine‑tuning, “anclaje” for grounding). Consistency is adequate but could be improved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator kept the original intent and tone, adapting greetings and cultural references appropriately. The Spanish wording respects the target audience, with only minor lapses in stylistic nuance.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas, examples, and analogies from the French script are present. No substantive information is omitted, and the translation does not add irrelevant content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and clearly. It is readable and complete, but a few lexical choices (especially for technical jargon) feel slightly off for a native‑speaker audience. Polishing those terms would raise fluency and terminology scores, bringing the translation closer to a native‑like quality.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 16/20, Fluency 14/20, Terminology 15/20, Contextual Adaptation 17/20, Information Completeness 18/20. Total: 80/100.\n\nThe translation is solid and functional for most readers, yet refinement of terminology and idiomatic phrasing would improve its naturalness.\n\nRecommendation: replace “el afinado” with “el ajuste fino”, adjust punctuation, and ensure consistent use of established AI terminology in Spanish.\n\nScore out of 100: 80."
