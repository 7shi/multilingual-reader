  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is difficult to follow. Sentences are fragmented, speaker tags are duplicated or misplaced, and many stray symbols (e.g., “}”, “{”, “]”) interrupt the flow. A reader would have to pause repeatedly to decipher whether a line belongs to Camille or Luc, making comprehension labor‑intensive.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Numerous unnatural expressions appear: \"el pre‑entrenamiento””, \"optimización\" for fine‑tuning (acceptable but later inconsistently used), \"ancrage\" left untranslated, and literal‑word‑for‑word renderings that sound awkward in Spanish. The presence of raw editor notes (\"improved_translation:\") and missing punctuation further breaks the naturalness.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are partially handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\" and \"ventana de contexto\" are correctly rendered, but \"fine‑tuning\" becomes \"optimización\" without clarification, and \"In‑Context Learning (ICL)\" is sometimes omitted or left in English. The term \"grounding\" is left as \"ancrage\" in parentheses, which may confuse Spanish‑speaking readers.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to keep the podcast tone, but the numerous formatting errors and untranslated fragments prevent the original intent from being clearly conveyed. Cultural adaptation is minimal, and the broken structure hinders the listener‑like experience intended for a podcast script.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Key ideas from the French script are present in outline (pre‑training, transfer learning, ICL, memory features), yet many sentences are truncated or garbled, causing loss of nuance (e.g., the analogy about \"bachotage\", the detailed explanation of the memory‑feature implementation, and the concluding call‑to‑action). Consequently, the Spanish version omits or obscures several details.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely unsuccessful. While the core concepts are recognizable, the output is riddled with formatting glitches, incomplete sentences, and inconsistent terminology. A native Spanish reader would struggle to understand the podcast dialogue, and the technical explanations lose clarity. Substantial editing, cleanup, and consistent term handling are required to reach an acceptable quality level for a public‑facing podcast script.\n\nOverall rating (out of 20): 6.5/20 (rounded to 6). The translation needs a thorough revision rather than minor polishing.\n\n**Breakdown**: readability 6, fluency 5, terminology 8, contextual adaptation 7, information completeness 6. The cumulative raw score is 32/100, which translates to roughly 6‑7/20 overall."
