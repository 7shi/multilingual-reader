    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the concepts are explained clearly. A few long sentences could be split for better flow, but overall a native‑speaker reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are some awkward choices: “bacotaje” is not a standard Spanish term (the usual would be *estudiar a fondo* or *memorizar*), and the English word *grounding* is left untranslated while earlier the concept was rendered as *anclaje*. Minor punctuation quirks (spaces before quotation marks) also affect smoothness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well overall: *pré‑entraînement* → *preentrenamiento*, *transfer learning* → *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto* for “context window”, and the retention of English terms like *fine‑tuning* is acceptable in Spanish technical discourse. The only weak point is the non‑standard “bacotaje”. Consistency is otherwise good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. The analogies (consultant, bike‑riding) are kept and make sense for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor inconsistencies (mixing *grounding* and *anclaje*) slightly reduce the cultural adaptation, but the overall message is intact.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No relevant information is omitted. All examples, explanations, and the concluding call‑to‑action are present. The translation even adds a brief clarification (“memoria a corto plazo”) that does not distort the original meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and keeps the educational tone. Readability and completeness are strong points. Fluency suffers from a few non‑standard lexical choices and inconsistent handling of the term *grounding*. Terminology is largely appropriate, with only minor lapses. Overall, it is a solid translation that would be easily understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience, but polishing the few awkward expressions would raise it to near‑perfect quality.\n\n**Overall score:** 17/20 (average of the five evaluated criteria)."
