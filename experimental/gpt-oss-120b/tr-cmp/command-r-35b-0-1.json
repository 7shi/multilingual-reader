  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the dialogue flows naturally, allowing readers to grasp the technical concepts without difficulty. A few minor punctuation quirks (e.g., missing opening question marks) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds largely natural to a native speaker. Most expressions are idiomatic, but there are occasional slight awkwardnesses such as “Mira esto:” (more formal would be “Mire esto:”) and the missing opening question marks in some interrogatives. Overall, the language is smooth and fluent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled appropriately. “Pre‑entrenamiento”/“preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “ventana de contexto”, “anclaje” and the acronyms (ICL, etc.) are correctly rendered. The occasional hyphenation inconsistency does not affect understanding, and the English acronyms are kept where appropriate.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of the podcast, adapting jokes and analogies (e.g., “chuleta”) suitably for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the speaker personalities remain intact. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve polish, but the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French source is present. No notable omissions or distortions are observed, and the technical explanations remain intact. Redundancies are minimal, and the content stays concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, reads well, and maintains the conversational style of the original podcast. Minor punctuation and phrasing adjustments would push it to near‑perfect fluency, but the current version is very effective for Spanish‑language listeners.\n\nScore (average of criteria): 18.4 → rounded to 18/20 overall.\n\nScore: 18\n\nReasoning: The translation excels in completeness, terminology, and readability, while fluency and contextual nuance are very good but have small room for improvement. This yields an overall rating of 18 out of 20."
