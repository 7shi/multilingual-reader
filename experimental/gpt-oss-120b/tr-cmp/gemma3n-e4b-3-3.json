    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original. Most sentences are understandable, but a few hiccups lower the score: the French interjection “¿C’est‑à‑dire?” is left untranslated, and some long sentences could be broken for easier reading. Overall the text is comprehensible for a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly naturally, using appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic constructions. However, there are occasional awkward phrasings (e.g., “comienzas con un contexto vacío”, “Ese es el verdadero poder de este enfoque” with markdown emphasis) and redundant expressions (“ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”). These minor issues prevent a perfect fluency rating.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, anclaje, etc., are correctly rendered and consistently used. The brief parenthetical clarification of “fine‑tuning” adds helpful context. Only a tiny inconsistency is the occasional English acronym kept without translation, which is acceptable in this domain.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish and respects cultural expectations. The only notable lapse is the untranslated French phrase and the presence of markdown markup, which feel out‑of‑place for a spoken script. Otherwise the adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the ideas, examples, and analogies from the French original are present. No essential information is omitted; the added parenthetical note about fine‑tuning actually clarifies the concept further. The content is complete and accurate.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and in a way that is largely understandable to Spanish‑speaking listeners. It succeeds in preserving technical nuance and the conversational tone, though a few residual French fragments, minor unnatural phrasing, and leftover markdown formatting keep it from achieving a higher fluency and readability rating. With a quick clean‑up of those small issues, the version would be excellent for a podcast audience.\n\nFinal score (out of 100): 80/100."
