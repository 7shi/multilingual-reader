  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is a collection of editorial notes, placeholders (e.g., **Revised version**, **Versión mejorada**), and fragmented sentences. A reader cannot follow a coherent dialogue because the original podcast script is not presented in a continuous form. The presence of meta‑instructions interrupts the flow, making comprehension difficult.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Because the text mixes actual Spanish sentences with English terms, bracketed comments, and multiple alternative phrasings, it does not read as natural Spanish. Several expressions are awkward (e.g., \"La borra todo\", \"El borrador actual es casi correcto\"), and the alternation between formal and colloquial registers is inconsistent.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"aprendizaje por contexto\" are correctly identified, but the translation offers many conflicting alternatives and sometimes leaves the English acronym (ICL) without explanation. Consistency is lacking, though the core terminology is mostly present.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to adapt certain concepts to a Spanish‑speaking audience (e.g., using \"máster\" for specialization), but the numerous editorial notes prevent the intended message from being delivered. Cultural adaptation is therefore only partially achieved.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A large portion of the original script is missing; instead of a full dialogue, the document contains only fragments, suggestions, and placeholders. Important explanatory passages, examples, and the overall narrative are omitted, resulting in a very incomplete rendering.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "overall_comment": "The provided material is not a finished translation but a working draft filled with editorial instructions, alternative phrasings, and placeholders. While the translator has identified key technical terms and offered several plausible Spanish equivalents, the final product is far from usable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. To be acceptable, the draft would need to be transformed into a coherent, continuous script that fully conveys the original podcast’s content, with consistent terminology, natural phrasing, and no remaining meta‑comments.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 5/20."
