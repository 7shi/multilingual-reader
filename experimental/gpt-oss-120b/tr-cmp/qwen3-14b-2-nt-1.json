  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Complex ideas are explained in a straightforward way and the sentence flow is logical. The only noticeable issue is the untranslated French interjection \"D'accord.\", which may confuse readers who do not know French.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, using appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic constructions. Small awkwardness appears in a few places, such as \"Usted entiende todo\" (a more natural phrasing would be \"Lo entiendes todo\" or \"Entiendes todo\") and occasional inconsistency in formality. These do not break comprehension but slightly reduce the smoothness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" and \"memoria a corto plazo\". The translation of \"grounding\" as \"fundamentación\" is acceptable, though \"anclaje\" is more common; overall terminology is consistent and appropriate for the intended audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and cultural references. It adapts the consultant analogy well for Spanish‑speaking listeners. The lone untranslated French phrase slightly detracts from full adaptation, but otherwise the content feels natural for the target audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All substantive information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No key points are omitted, and the flow of the dialogue remains intact. The only minor blemish is the retained French interjection, which does not cause loss of information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical concepts clearly, uses appropriate terminology, and maintains the conversational style of the podcast. Minor issues—an untranslated French phrase and a few slightly unnatural wordings—prevent it from being perfect, but they do not impede comprehension. The translation would be well‑understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI topics.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20"
