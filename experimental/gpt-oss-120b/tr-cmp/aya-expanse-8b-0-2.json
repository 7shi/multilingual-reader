  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand. Sentences are logical and the flow mirrors the original dialogue. A few constructions are slightly literal (e.g., “Usted ha entendido todo”) but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several moments where the translation sounds stiff or overly literal, such as “Usted ha entendido todo”, “Se puede decir que es eso”, and the use of formal “Usted” in a casual podcast. Nevertheless, most phrasing is natural for a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *ICL*, *anclaje*, etc., are consistently translated and kept in Spanish where appropriate. No major mismatches were found.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of the podcast. Cultural adaptation is adequate, though the opening “Buenos días” may be overly specific for a podcast that could be listened to at any time. The biggest slip is the change of the podcast name at the very end from “Tech Éclair” to “Tech Flash”.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is lost, and the explanations remain intact. The only minor inconsistency is the final brand name change, which slightly alters the original branding.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. Terminology is appropriate and the dialogue remains faithful to the source. Some literal renderings make the text feel a bit stiff, and the inconsistency in the podcast’s name at the end is a noticeable slip. With minor polishing, especially to improve naturalness and fix the naming error, the translation would be excellent.\n\nOverall Score (out of 100): 83/100"
