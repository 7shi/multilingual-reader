  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original logical flow. However, typographical errors (e.g., “crammar”, “increñablemente”, “perfila”) and occasional overly literal constructions make some sentences feel clunky, which slightly hinders smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural for native speakers: “el afinomamiento”, “ancoraje”, “Sería increñablemente ineficiente”, and the inclusion of English‑style parenthetical notes. These issues break the natural rhythm, even though the overall meaning is clear.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto/ICL) are mostly correctly rendered. Mistakes like “el afinomamiento” and “ancoraje” show inconsistency, but the terminology is largely appropriate for the intended audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and adds a few explanatory sentences that are helpful (e.g., “Este proceso de aprendizaje se basa en la acumulación de grandes cantidades de datos”). Minor mis‑renderings (e.g., “crammar” for “cram”) and cultural mismatches slightly affect adaptation, but the overall message is preserved.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present; no significant ideas are omitted. Some added commentary does not detract from completeness, though a few nuances (like the precise difference between temporary and permanent knowledge) could be sharper.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the core concepts of the podcast and is largely complete, but it is marred by typographical errors, occasional mistranslations of technical terms, and unnatural phrasing that reduce readability and fluency. A careful proofreading and adjustment of the few inaccurate terms would raise the quality substantially.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 13/20.\nScore out of 20 points: 13"
