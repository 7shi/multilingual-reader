  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the dialogue format is preserved, making the technical discussion accessible. A few long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but overall comprehension is not hindered.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are occasional literal renderings (e.g., \"es estudiar de memoria\", \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\") that feel slightly awkward to a native ear. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and the informal podcast tone is kept.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\" → \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\" → \"ajuste fino\", \"In‑Context Learning\" → \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\", etc. The same acronyms (ICL) are retained, and explanations remain consistent throughout the text.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent, preserving the conversational and explanatory style. Cultural references are neutral, and the informal greeting \"Hola y bienvenida\" fits Spanish‑speaking audiences. Minor phrasing issues do not affect the overall message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted, and the technical concepts are fully conveyed. The only loss is a tiny nuance in the original phrasing that is not critical to understanding.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content clearly. Minor awkward phrasings and a few overly literal translations prevent a perfect score, but the text remains fluent, accurate, and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience. Overall quality is high, with room for slight polishing to reach native‑like smoothness.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 17.4/20."
