  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the dialogue format is preserved, so a native reader can understand the concepts without difficulty. A few long sentences could be split for better flow, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places. Minor awkwardness appears in phrases such as “Vea más bien:” and “en segundo plano”, which feel slightly literal. Vocabulary choice is appropriate and the style matches a podcast script, but a couple of expressions could be smoother.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento” (although “ajuste fino” is also common), “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”. Consistency is maintained and explanations are kept, making the terminology appropriate for the intended audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately. The informal podcast tone is preserved. Some French‑specific turns (e.g., “Vea más bien”) could be rendered more idiomatically in Spanish, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No content is omitted, and the logical flow of the discussion is retained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and keeps the conversational podcast style. Minor phrasing issues prevent it from being flawless, but they do not hinder understanding. Technical terminology is well‑chosen, and the complete information is retained throughout. A few idiomatic adjustments would make the text feel even more natural to native Spanish listeners, but overall it is an excellent rendering of the original French dialogue.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 92"
