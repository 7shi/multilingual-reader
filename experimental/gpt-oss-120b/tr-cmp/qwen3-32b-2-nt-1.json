  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the flow of ideas mirrors the original. The explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are clear and the dialogue format remains coherent. Minor phrasing quirks (e.g., \"muy realista\") do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most of the text. Vocabulary is appropriate and the style matches a podcast conversation. There are a few literal renderings that feel slightly stiff (\"muy realista\", \"una antisèche\" becomes \"una guía rápida\") but overall the language is smooth and idiomatic.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated and kept recognizable (preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, grounding). When necessary, the English term is retained in parentheses, which is helpful for a technically‑savvy audience. No mis‑use of jargon was detected.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the original intent, tone, and pedagogical approach. Cultural references are neutral, and the examples (consultor brillante, bicicleta) are well‑adapted to Spanish‑speaking listeners. A few expressions could be refined for greater local flavor, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No information is omitted, and the supplementary explanations (e.g., how the \"Memoria\" feature works) are retained. Redundancy is minimal, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains understandable, and mostly sounds natural in Spanish. Minor stylistic tweaks could raise fluency a point or two, but the work successfully delivers the original podcast script to a Spanish‑speaking audience without loss of meaning or clarity."
