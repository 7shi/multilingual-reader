  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and conveys the main ideas, but many sentences are overly long, contain redundant repetitions, and some phrasing is clunky (e.g., \"marca de memoria a corto plazo\", \"Usted ha captado la idea perfectamente\"). These issues force the reader to re‑parse the sentences, slightly hampering smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several unnatural constructions and inconsistencies in register (mix of formal \"Usted\" and informal \"tú\"). Word choices such as \"enraizamiento\" instead of the more common \"anclaje\" or \"grounding\", and literal translations like \"marca de memoria a corto plazo\" make the text sound translated rather than native. The flow is therefore only moderate.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly present (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, aprendizaje en contexto), but the handling is inconsistent: \"fine‑tuning\" appears both as \"fine‑tuning\" and \"afinado\", \"grounding\" is left untranslated, and \"ventana de contexto\" is replaced by the awkward \"marca de memoria a corto plazo\". The inconsistency can confuse readers familiar with the usual Spanish terminology.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original French‑style exposition without adapting to typical Spanish podcast language. It stays fairly literal, missing opportunities to use more natural colloquial expressions or cultural references that would resonate with a Spanish‑speaking audience. Nonetheless, the intent and tone of the original are preserved.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present, including the distinction between fine‑tuning and in‑context learning, the concept of grounding, and the explanation of “memory” features. Some redundancy and occasional omission of minor clarifications (e.g., the exact meaning of \"fenêtre de contexte\") are noted, but no essential information is lost.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the content and technical concepts adequately, but it suffers from a lack of natural flow, inconsistent terminology, and occasional awkward phrasing. A thorough edit focusing on register, terminology consistency, and smoother sentence construction would raise the quality substantially.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 13.4 → rounded to 13/20.\n\nScore: 13"
