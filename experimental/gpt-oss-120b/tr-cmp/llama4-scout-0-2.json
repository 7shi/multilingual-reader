  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste, aprendizaje por transferencia, etc.) are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. Minor hiccups such as the formal \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\" in an otherwise informal podcast setting slightly affect flow, but overall comprehension is excellent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds largely natural to a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and most idiomatic expressions are well chosen (e.g., \"entre bastidores\", \"una antisèche\" rendered as \"una ayuda\"). There are a few slightly stiff or overly formal turns (\"Usted lo ha entendido todo\", \"el ajuste\" instead of \"ajuste fino\") that make the tone feel a bit mismatched for a casual podcast, but they do not impede fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly. Key terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste\" (fine‑tuning), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are accurately translated and consistently used throughout. The translator chose standard Spanish equivalents that are familiar to the target audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and explanatory style, but the choice of formal second‑person pronouns (\"Usted\") contrasts with the informal, conversational tone typical of podcasts, where \"tú\" would be more natural. Apart from this register issue, cultural references are well adapted and no meaning is lost.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is retained. No sentences or ideas are omitted, and the explanatory depth is preserved. Minor paraphrasing (e.g., \"una ayuda\" for \"una antisèche\") does not remove any essential content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and reads well, with only minor stylistic and register issues that prevent it from being completely natural for a podcast audience. The terminology is spot‑on, and the information is fully preserved, making the translation suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners who want a clear understanding of AI training concepts.\n\nScore summary: 18 + 17 + 19 + 16 + 20 = 90/100.\n\nRecommended improvements: adjust the pronoun and verb forms to a more informal \"tú\" register, and consider using \"ajuste fino\" instead of just \"ajuste\" to match common Spanish usage for fine‑tuning.\n\nOverall rating: 90/100."
