  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mixes the actual dialogue with numerous parenthetical comments about how the translation could be improved. These meta‑remarks interrupt the flow and force the reader to constantly switch between the spoken content and editorial notes. As a result, a Spanish‑speaking listener would find it hard to follow the conversation, especially because the speaker labels (Camille, Luc) appear repeatedly within long paragraphs that also contain explanatory side‑bars.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While many sentences are grammatically correct, the text contains awkward constructions (e.g., \"La versión mejorada mantiene the original message's integrity\", \"la IA no ha « olvidado » en el sentido humano del término; su espacio de trabajo temporal simplemente ha sido vaciado\"), occasional English fragments, and inconsistent use of punctuation and capitalization. The presence of HTML tags (<br>) and the mixture of formal and colloquial registers also make the prose feel unnatural for a podcast script.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are correctly rendered and consistently used. The translator occasionally offers alternative phrasings, which is useful, but the inclusion of those alternatives inside the dialogue distracts from the core content.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent of explaining AI training concepts to a general audience. However, the insertion of editorial comments (\"Esta versión mantiene el significado original y mejora la fluidez\") changes the tone from a natural podcast conversation to a meta‑translation discussion, which is not appropriate for the target audience. Cultural references are preserved, but the overall adaptation suffers from the mixed registers.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of \"memory\" features. No major factual omissions are detected, though the added commentary creates redundancy and occasional over‑explanation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full technical content of the original podcast, and the terminology is handled well. Unfortunately, the frequent interspersed editorial remarks, English fragments, and formatting artifacts severely damage readability and naturalness. A clean version that removes the meta‑comments and smooths the phrasing would be much more suitable for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience.\n\n**Final Scores (out of 20 each):**\n- Readability: 10\n- Fluency: 9\n- Terminology: 15\n- Contextual Adaptation: 12\n- Information Completeness: 16\n\nOverall, the translation is functionally complete but needs substantial editing to become a polished, listener‑friendly script."
