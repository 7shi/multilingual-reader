  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logical and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor typographical errors (e.g., missing accent in \"¿Porque\") and occasional long sentences slightly affect flow, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but a few lexical choices feel slightly forced for native speakers (e.g., \"el afinamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\"). There are also punctuation issues with opening question marks and a couple of awkward constructions that break the smoothness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"grounding\" are all rendered appropriately. Consistency is maintained throughout. The only minor drawback is the use of \"afinamiento\" instead of the more standard \"ajuste fino\", but the meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of the podcast dialogue. It adapts expressions to Spanish‑speaking audiences without losing the explanatory nature of the content. A few cultural nuances (e.g., the consultant metaphor) could be refined, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No substantial ideas are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue closely. Minor typographic issues do not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. Readability and terminology are strong points, while fluency could be polished by adjusting a few word choices and fixing punctuation. The translation successfully maintains the podcast’s educational tone and delivers the complete content to Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\nScore (average of criteria): 17/20"
