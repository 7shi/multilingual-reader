  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are mostly short and the flow of the dialogue is preserved. Concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinado y aprendizaje en contexto are explained clearly. Minor issues like the hyphenated “pre‑entrenamiento” and occasional overly literal phrasing do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., “para proporcionarle una base cultural”, “aprendizaje automatizado en contexto”). The parenthetical note “un truco (or *apunte*, or *resumen rápido*)” mixes English and Spanish and feels out of place. Overall, the text is fluent but not completely polished.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”. The term “grounding” is left in English, which is acceptable for a niche audience, but a Spanish equivalent could have been offered for consistency. The use of *prompt* is also kept in italics, which is appropriate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the podcast tone and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., “consultor brillante”). It conveys the original intent and purpose effectively. The only drawback is the mixed‑language parenthesis mentioned above, which slightly breaks the cultural adaptation.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is preserved. The extra explanatory parenthesis does not remove any content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational style of the podcast, and includes virtually all the original information. Minor fluency issues and the occasional mixing of languages prevent a perfect score, but the text is clear, informative, and well‑adapted for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\n**Total score (average):** 17.8 / 20"
