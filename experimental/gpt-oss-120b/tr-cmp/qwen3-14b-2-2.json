  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the ideas are clearly expressed. Sentences are generally well‑structured, and the dialogue format is preserved. A few very long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but overall a Spanish reader can understand the concepts without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic, but there are occasional minor awkwardnesses (e.g., spacing before punctuation, “informaciones” instead of the more common “información”, and a slightly stilted phrase “es una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”). These do not impede comprehension but prevent a fully native feel.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto* (ICL), and *anclaje* are all rendered with the standard Spanish equivalents. The abbreviation ICL is retained and explained, and the newer “Memoria” feature is kept as a proper noun, preserving consistency throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast discussion. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogies (e.g., “consultor brillante”, “aprender a montar en bicicleta”) are adapted naturally to Spanish. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve flow, but the message is fully conveyed for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No relevant detail is omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue, ensuring the listener receives the same content without loss or redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is very good. It accurately conveys the technical content, maintains the conversational style, and uses appropriate terminology. Small stylistic and punctuation issues prevent a perfect score, but the text is clear, natural, and complete for Spanish readers/listeners.\n\nStrengths: faithful terminology, complete information, clear explanations of complex ideas.\nWeaknesses: occasional punctuation quirks and slightly long sentences that affect fluency.\n\nThe translation would be readily understood by a non‑technical audience while still satisfying more knowledgeable listeners.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18/20."
