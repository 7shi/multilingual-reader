  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but numerous typographic and grammatical errors (missing opening exclamation marks, mismatched gender, accidental English words, inconsistent use of \"Usted\" vs \"tú\") interrupt the flow. Some sentences are awkwardly phrased, making it harder for a native reader to follow without rereading.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many literal renderings that sound unnatural in Spanish (e.g., \"encaje (enraizamiento)\" for grounding, \"aprendizaje contextual, es memoria de estudios\", \"cuando begins\"). The rhythm is choppy and the mix of formal and informal registers reduces naturalness.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"ICL (Aprendizaje In‑Context)\" are correctly kept. However, the translation of \"grounding\" as \"encaje\" is inaccurate, and a few terms are inconsistently rendered, slightly lowering the score.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original podcast style, but cultural adaptation is limited. Mixed registers, improper punctuation, and the occasional English word (\"begins\") make the text feel less polished for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the explanation of memory features. No substantial information is omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the full content of the original episode and uses the correct technical vocabulary, which is a strong point. Nevertheless, frequent grammatical slips, awkward phrasing, and a few inaccurate term translations hinder readability and fluency. A thorough proofread and some localization of idiomatic expressions would raise the quality considerably.\nOverall score (out of 100): 65/100.\nRecommendations: correct punctuation, unify register, replace \"encaje\" with \"anclaje\" or \"grounding\", and eliminate residual English fragments. A native‑speaker edit would greatly improve naturalness.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 12/20, Fluency 10/20, Terminology 13/20, Contextual Adaptation 12/20, Information Completeness 18/20."
