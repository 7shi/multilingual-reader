  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow; sentences are generally short and the dialogue flow mirrors the original. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained clearly. A few minor typographical quirks (e.g., “preentrenamiento ” with an extra space, unnecessary commas) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several literal renderings feel a bit stiff: “Véase: no enseñarías…”, “El aprendizaje en contexto, es el bachotaje.”, and keeping the French word “ancrage” instead of using the Spanish “anclaje”. These small issues prevent a fully fluent reading.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding, etc. Consistency is good, but the decision to leave the French term “ancrage” untranslated is a slight lapse. Overall the terminology is appropriate for a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The podcast tone is preserved and the content is culturally neutral, making it suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor phrasing choices (e.g., “¡Una perfecta analogía!”) are acceptable, though a more idiomatic alternative could improve the adaptation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is retained. No ideas are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The only minor deviation is the untranslated French term, which does not affect factual completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast’s educational content accurately and is largely clear and understandable. It excels in preserving technical detail and overall structure. A few literal translations and the occasional retention of French terminology make the text feel slightly less natural than a native‑crafted version, but these are relatively minor. With small polishing—especially replacing “ancrage” with “anclaje” and smoothing a couple of literal phrases—the translation would reach a very high level of fluency and readability.\nOverall rating: 17/20."
