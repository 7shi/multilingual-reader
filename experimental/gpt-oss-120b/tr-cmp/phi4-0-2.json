  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly logical and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor awkward phrasing such as “para dársela un conocimiento general” slightly hampers smooth reading, but the overall message is understandable.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are a few grammatical slips and inconsistent use of pronouns (e.g., “refinás” vs. the rest of the text). Some expressions are literal translations that feel odd to native speakers (“ventana de contexto”, “anclaje”). These issues prevent full fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well handled: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, etc. The choices are appropriate, even if “afinamiento” is less common than “ajuste fino”. Consistency is maintained throughout the text.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts it well for a Spanish‑speaking audience. No cultural references are lost, and the examples remain clear. Slight lexical oddities do not affect the overall adaptation.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted or altered, and the logical flow of the discussion is maintained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and is largely readable for Spanish speakers. While the technical terminology is solid, occasional unnatural phrasing and minor grammatical inconsistencies reduce overall fluency. With a few stylistic adjustments, the text would be excellent.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
