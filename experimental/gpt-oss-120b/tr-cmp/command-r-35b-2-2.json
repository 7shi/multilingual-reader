    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the logical flow of the original. However, there are several redundant or clunky sentences (e.g., the duplicated definition of pre‑entrenamiento, the overly literal “O bien: El proceso de aprendizaje se inicia…”) that slightly disrupt smooth reading. The overall comprehension is good but not optimal.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural, but a few phrasing choices feel literal or awkward: “aprendizaje por inserción y calibración (ICL)” is not the usual term, the meta‑comment about \"propuesta\" feels out of place, and occasional word order issues (e.g., \"el modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus discusiones\"). The use of the slang \"chuleta\" is acceptable in informal contexts but may not suit a podcast script. Hence fluency is decent but not fully native‑like.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are correctly rendered. Inconsistencies appear later with the incorrect translation \"Aprendizaje por Inserción y Calibración (ICL)\" and the mixed use of \"encastrement\" for \"anclaje\". The terminology is mostly appropriate but suffers from occasional mismatches.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally preserves the original intent and adapts the discourse for Spanish‑speaking listeners. The added comment about \"propuesta\" vs. \"aproximación\" shows awareness of nuance. Nevertheless, some literal translations and the redundant definition of pre‑entrenamiento reduce the natural cultural adaptation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the added explanatory notes do not alter the core content. The translation is therefore complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the podcast’s technical discussion accurately and retains most of the original information. Readability and fluency are good but are hampered by a few redundant or literal constructions and an incorrect rendering of the ICL acronym. Terminology is largely correct, though consistency could be improved. Overall, the translation is functional and understandable, but a second pass focusing on smoothing awkward sentences and fixing the ICL terminology would raise it to a higher professional standard."
