  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall clear and the concepts are explained in a way that a Spanish‑speaking audience can follow. However, there is a noticeable typo (“moldena” instead of “moldea”) and occasional awkward phrasing that can momentarily hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several expressions feel forced or non‑idiomatic (e.g., “afinamiento” for fine‑tuning, inconsistent hyphenation of “pre‑entrenamiento”, and long run‑on sentences). These issues reduce the overall fluency despite the correct grammar in most places.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally well‑handled: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “anclaje”, etc. The choice of “afinamiento” for fine‑tuning is understandable but less common than “ajuste fino”, and the abbreviation ICL is left untranslated, which is acceptable. Overall consistency is good.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style of the podcast. Cultural references are appropriate, and the explanatory note about the double exclamation mark is retained. Minor lexical quirks aside, the adaptation fits the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant information is omitted or altered. All examples, analogies, and explanations from the French source appear in the Spanish version, and the added clarification about the exclamation mark does not change meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the full technical content of the original podcast. It succeeds in making the material understandable for Spanish speakers, but the presence of a typo, some non‑idiomatic word choices, and occasional clumsy sentence constructions prevent it from reaching a fully natural, native‑like level. With minor lexical adjustments and correction of the typo, the text would be excellent."
