  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are clear and the logical flow mirrors the original. A few literal renderings (e.g., “Vea más bien:” instead of a more natural “Mira mejor” or “Más bien”) cause slight hiccups, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are occasional awkward phrasings and literal translations (“Vea más bien:”, “el modelo en sí no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus discusiones”) that a native speaker would phrase differently. Vocabulary is appropriate, and the overall rhythm is good.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, grounding → anclaje, etc. The terminology is consistent throughout and matches what a Spanish‑speaking technical audience expects.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately. Examples and analogies are preserved and understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor phrasing choices could be smoother, but the overall adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is retained. No ideas are omitted, and no extraneous content is added. The translation faithfully reproduces the dialogue and technical explanations.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the technical content clearly. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency could be polished in a few places to sound more native. The translator succeeded in preserving the podcast’s explanatory style and did not lose any essential information. Minor stylistic adjustments would bring the text from very good to excellent.\n\nFinal overall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
