  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. Most sentences are clear, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can follow. Minor issues such as the isolated line “Luc: pre‑entrenamiento” and occasional missing accents slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural to native speakers: mixing French (“Et yo soy Luc”) with Spanish, using “ancraje” instead of the more common “anclaje”, leaving French words like “Mémoire” untranslated, and some clunky constructions (“se basa en unas bases extremadamente sólidas”). These reduce the naturalness of the text.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly kept, which is acceptable for a podcast audience. However, the translation sometimes leaves English/French terms untranslated (e.g., “fine‑tuning”, “grounding”) or uses uncommon Spanish equivalents (“ancraje”). Consistency could be improved, but the core terminology is recognizable.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone, but the occasional code‑switching (French/English words left in) and the literal translation of the podcast title to “Tech Flash” (instead of keeping “Tech Éclair”) slightly reduce cultural adaptation for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original script is present. No major ideas are omitted, and the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning and memory features are retained.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully transmits the original content and technical explanations, making the episode comprehensible to Spanish listeners. Nevertheless, it suffers from inconsistent language mixing, occasional awkward phrasing, and sub‑optimal terminology choices that prevent it from feeling fully native. With a few edits to clean up the code‑switching and refine terminology, the quality would rise substantially.\nOverall rating (average of criteria): 15.8 ≈ 16/20.\nScore: 16"
