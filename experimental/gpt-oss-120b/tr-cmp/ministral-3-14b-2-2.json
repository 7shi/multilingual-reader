    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas are easy to follow. Most sentences convey the original meaning, and the technical concepts are explained in a way a non‑expert can grasp. However, there are a few disruptive artifacts – the stray word “syntaxe”, an unfinished placeholder “Camille: translation”, and occasional awkward phrasing – that force the reader to pause and can momentarily hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly natural, using appropriate colloquial Spanish. Vocabulary choices such as “ventana de contexto”, “ajuste fino” and “aprendizaje en contexto” are idiomatic. Nevertheless, some constructions feel slightly forced (e.g., “exponerlo a una cantidad mucho menor de texto”, “vinculación a datos concretos”) and the presence of English terms in parentheses and the leftover placeholders break the flow.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well overall: “entrenamiento previo”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “grounding”, etc., are correctly rendered. The translator sometimes keeps the English word (fine‑tuning, prompt) but provides a helpful note, which is acceptable for a technical audience. The inconsistency of using both “fine‑tuning” and “ajuste fino” in the same passage is a minor issue.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue, and cultural references are appropriate for Spanish‑speaking listeners. The explanatory note about the word *prompt* is a helpful adaptation. However, missing lines (the question about permanence of fine‑tuned knowledge) and leftover placeholders reduce the completeness of the adaptation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the content from the French script is transferred, but several parts are omitted or truncated: the line where Camille asks whether fine‑tuned knowledge persists is replaced by “translation”, and the stray “syntaxe” line adds noise without providing the intended meaning. These gaps mean the translation does not fully convey all information present in the source.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is a solid first draft that captures the core ideas and uses generally natural Spanish. Technical terms are mostly well rendered and the explanatory notes are useful. However, the presence of placeholders, an untranslated word, and missing sentences indicates the work is unfinished. A careful proofread to remove artifacts, fill in the omitted content, and smooth a few awkward phrases would raise the quality substantially."
