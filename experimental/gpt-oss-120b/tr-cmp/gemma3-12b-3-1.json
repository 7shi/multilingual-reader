  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. Minor issues such as the change of the podcast name (\"Tech Éclair\" → \"Tecno Revelada\") and occasional long sentences slightly affect flow, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most of the passage, but a few expressions feel a bit forced or overly literal (e.g., \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\", \"fundamentación\" for \"grounding\"). Word choice is mostly appropriate, yet some phrasing could be smoother to match native speech.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\". The translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"perfeccionamiento\" and \"grounding\" as \"fundamentación\" are less standard and may cause slight confusion for readers familiar with the usual jargon (\"ajuste fino\", \"anclaje\").",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts well to a Spanish‑speaking audience, keeping the tone conversational and the analogies relevant. The only notable deviation is the renaming of the podcast, which alters the original branding. Otherwise, cultural references and register are appropriate.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original script is present. No major ideas are omitted, and the explanations remain faithful to the source. Minor stylistic differences do not affect the conveyed content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is solid and conveys the original message accurately. Readability and completeness are strong, while fluency and terminology could be refined, especially regarding the translation of specific AI jargon and the occasional unnatural phrasing. The change of the podcast title is a minor inconsistency but does not break understanding. The translation would benefit from using more conventional technical terms and smoothing a few awkward sentences, but it is functional and clear for the target audience.\n\nScore (average of criteria): 15.6 ≈ 16/20.\nOverall rating: 78/100 (or 16/20)."
