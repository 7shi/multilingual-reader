  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the concepts are explained clearly. A few long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but overall a Spanish‑speaking audience can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, using appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic expressions. There are a few awkward phrases such as “aprendizaje intensivo en contexto” (instead of simply “aprendizaje en contexto”) and “Inteligencia Artificial de Lenguaje (ICL)” which mis‑labels the acronym. These minor slips prevent a fully native‑like fluency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly rendered (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, anclaje). The main inconsistency is the erroneous expansion of ICL as “Inteligencia Artificial de Lenguaje”. Apart from that, terminology is consistent and appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the intro and examples to Spanish cultural expectations (e.g., “Bienvenidos a ‘Tech Éclair’”). The tone remains informal and conversational, matching the podcast format. Minor issues such as overly literal renderings of “consultant” as “consultor” do not significantly affect comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original script is present: description of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memoria” features. No important points are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality: it conveys the original message accurately and is mostly readable and natural for Spanish speakers. The primary drawbacks are a few awkward phrasings and a misinterpretation of the ICL acronym. With minor revisions, it would be excellent for a podcast audience.\n\nScore breakdown (out of 20 each): Readability 18, Fluency 16, Terminology 17, Contextual Adaptation 17, Information Completeness 19. Total: 87/100.\n\nRecommendations: replace “aprendizaje intensivo en contexto” with “aprendizaje en contexto”, correct the ICL expansion, and consider splitting some long sentences for smoother flow."
