  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas flow logically. Most sentences are easy to understand, and complex concepts are explained in a straightforward way. Minor issues such as a duplicated speaker label (\"Luc: Luc:\") and a few clunky phrasings slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, using appropriate colloquial expressions (e.g., \"¡Hola y bienvenidos!\", \"consultor brillante\"). However, there are occasional awkward constructions (e.g., \"El aprendizaje por transferencia es la clave. Fíjese:\"), a repeated speaker tag, and a few punctuation quirks that a native speaker would avoid.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is well‑handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\" and \"grounding\" are all correctly rendered and used consistently. The few English abbreviations are kept with their Spanish explanations, which is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts the style to a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience (e.g., \"Me llamo Camille\", \"¡Hola y bienvenidos!\"). Cultural references are neutral, and the tone remains conversational. Small slips (duplicate labels) do not affect the overall message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present; no substantive content is lost. The duplicated \"Luc: Luc:\" line is a typographic error rather than an omission, and no key idea is omitted or altered.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is very good. It conveys the technical content accurately, uses appropriate terminology, and adapts the conversational tone for Spanish listeners. The main shortcomings are minor typographic errors (duplicate speaker tags) and a few slightly unnatural phrasing choices that could be polished for a more fluid reading experience. With a quick proofread these issues would be easy to fix, bringing the translation to a near‑perfect level.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
