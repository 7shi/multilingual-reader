    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are clear. A few sentences are long, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, but there are occasional awkward turns (e.g., \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\", \"se acuerda\" instead of \"recuerda\", \"el afinamiento\" instead of a more common \"ajuste fino\"). These do not break understanding but slightly reduce native‑speaker fluidity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: “preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (In‑Context Learning)”, “grounding” → “anclaje”. Consistency is maintained throughout. The only minor point is the translation of “fine‑tuning” as “el afinamiento”, which is acceptable but less common than “ajuste fino”.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast conversation. Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience, and analogies (consultor brillante, aprender a montar en bicicleta) work well. No expression feels out of place.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French original is retained. No sections are omitted, and the explanatory details are kept intact. The translation is concise yet complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is strong. It conveys the technical content clearly and keeps the conversational tone of the podcast. Minor fluency issues and a less common translation of \"fine‑tuning\" prevent a perfect score, but the work is highly understandable and faithful to the source.\n\nStrengths: clear explanations, consistent terminology, good cultural adaptation, complete transfer of information.\nWeaknesses: occasional slightly awkward phrasing and a non‑standard term for \"fine‑tuning\".\n\nThe translation would be easily understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI topics.\n\nScore out of 100: 88"
