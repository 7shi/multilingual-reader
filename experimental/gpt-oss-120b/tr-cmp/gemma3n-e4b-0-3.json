  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand. Sentences are logically ordered and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., “Y eso aprendizaje” instead of “Y ese aprendizaje”, occasional missing accents) slightly disrupt smooth reading but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward or inconsistent expressions: the shift between \"Ustedes\" and \"vosotros\" pronouns, the slightly stilted \"Miren:\" and \"Ustedes han entendido perfectamente\", and occasional literal renderings that feel a bit forced. Overall, a native speaker would find it readable but not fully idiomatic.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is well‑handled. Key terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are correctly translated and consistently used. No important term is omitted or mistranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural references are appropriate for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Slight register inconsistencies (formal \"Ustedes\" vs informal \"vosotros\") prevent a perfect adaptation, but the overall message is conveyed accurately.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is retained. No significant content is lost or added unnecessarily. The nuances about temporary vs permanent knowledge, memory functions, and the analogy with consultants are all present.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. It handles most terminology correctly and keeps the original meaning intact. Minor grammatical errors, occasional awkward phrasing, and inconsistent use of pronouns prevent it from being completely fluent, but overall it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nStrengths: accurate terminology, completeness, clear explanation of concepts.\nWeaknesses: small grammatical glitches, register inconsistency, occasional literalness that sounds less natural.\nOverall rating: 84/100, indicating a good translation with room for polishing to reach native‑like fluency.\n\nRecommendations: standardize pronoun usage (choose either \"Usted\"/\"Ustedes\" or \"tú\"/\"vosotros\"), correct the few typographical errors, and re‑phrase the few stiff sentences for smoother flow.\n\nScore (total): 84 out of 100."
