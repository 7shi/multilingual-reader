    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable; the main ideas and technical explanations are clear. Minor phrasing issues (e.g., “un proceso muy real”, “¿Es decir?”) cause slight hiccups but do not block comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several sentences sound unnatural or contain grammatical errors: “bienvenidos en”, missing inverted question marks, gender mismatches, and the untranslated word “antisèche”. These make the text feel less like native Spanish.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, ventana de contexto). The choice of “afinamiento” for “fine‑tuning” is acceptable, though less common. The term “antisèche” was left in French, which breaks consistency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, but some cultural/linguistic adjustments are missing (e.g., “bienvenidos en” instead of “a”, “competencia es anclada”, “montas en silla”). These reduce the natural fit for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original script is present; no major omissions or additions. Minor redundancies (e.g., “Eso es exactamente eso”) do not affect completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the content and technical concepts well, making it suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, it needs polishing to improve fluency and idiomatic expression, fix a few grammatical errors, and translate all French terms (like “antisèche”). With these refinements, the text would read like a natural podcast script in Spanish.\n\nOverall, the work is solid but falls short of a fully native‑level rendering due to the noted awkwardness and minor errors.\n\nOverall score (out of 20): 16.0"
