  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the dialogue flow is easy to follow. Most sentences convey the original ideas without requiring extra effort from the reader. A few minor issues (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido para …” and occasional long sentences) slightly reduce smoothness, but overall comprehension is good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several awkward or unidiomatic expressions: the preposition in “bienvenido para”, the mix of formal “Usted” with informal “has entendido”, the plural error “las conocimientos”, and occasional literal translations that feel stiff. These make the text sound less natural to native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly. Core concepts such as “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)” and “grounding (anclaje)” are accurately rendered and consistently used. No critical term is missing or mis‑translated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast discussion. Cultural references are appropriate, and analogies (consultor brillante, aprender a montar en bicicleta) are retained. The main drawback is the inconsistent register (mix of “tú” and “usted”), which slightly weakens adaptation to the target audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present. No sections are omitted, and the explanations remain intact. Minor redundancies are kept but do not affect the completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation conveys the original content accurately and maintains the technical depth required for a tech‑focused audience. The main issues are stylistic: occasional unidiomatic phrasing, inconsistent use of formal/informal pronouns, and a few grammatical slips. Addressing these would raise fluency and readability to near‑native levels.\n\n**Strengths**: correct handling of terminology, faithful transmission of ideas, good overall structure.\n**Weaknesses**: register inconsistency, some literal translations that sound awkward, minor grammatical errors.\n**Recommendation**: revise the opening greeting, unify the pronoun register (preferably informal to match the original tone), and smooth out the few stiff constructions.\n\n**Final rating**: 16/20, indicating a solid translation that needs modest polishing for native‑speaker fluency."
