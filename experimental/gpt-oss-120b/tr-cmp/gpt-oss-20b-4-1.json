  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas without excessive complexity, and the flow of the podcast dialogue remains intact. A few long sentences could be broken up for smoother reading, but overall the content is comprehensible to native speakers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, using appropriate colloquial expressions (e.g., \"¡Hola y bienvenidos!\", \"consultor brillante\"). Some phrases are slightly literal (e.g., \"masiva expansión de la memoria a corto plazo\"), and a couple of minor stylistic tweaks would improve smoothness, but there are no glaring grammatical errors.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento (ajuste fino)\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". Consistency is maintained throughout, and the translator adds helpful parenthetical explanations where needed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the informal podcast tone and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., using Spanish exclamation marks, local idioms like \"¡Una analogía perfecta!\"). The intent and purpose of the original dialogue are fully preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent knowledge distinction, and the explanation of “memory” features. No significant information is omitted or altered.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately while keeping the conversational, lively tone of the original podcast. Minor stylistic adjustments could raise fluency a point or two, but the text is readily understandable and technically sound for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\nOverall, the work demonstrates strong competence in both language and subject‑matter translation.\nScore: 88/100 (average 17.6/20 per criterion)."
