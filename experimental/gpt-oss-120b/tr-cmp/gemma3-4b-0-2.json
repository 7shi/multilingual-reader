  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the main ideas clearly and the dialogue flow is easy to follow. Minor issues such as the repetitive line and occasional over‑use of “las informaciones” slightly hinder smooth reading, but overall a native reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound literal or awkward (e.g., “las informaciones”, “bachorear”, the duplicated sentence, and occasional word order that mirrors French). These reduce the naturalness of the text, though the majority of sentences are well‑formed.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly rendered (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, anclaje, memoria). The only notable lapse is the plural “informaciones”, which is not the usual Spanish term for “information”.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and adapts the examples to Spanish‑speaking listeners. A few cultural‑linguistic mismatches (e.g., “bachorear”) make some parts feel less natural, but the overall message is intact.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential points from the French script are present; no major ideas are omitted. The duplicated line is an error but does not cause loss of information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and captures the technical content and conversational tone of the podcast. Readability and completeness are good, but fluency suffers from literal renderings and occasional non‑standard word choices. With minor polishing—especially replacing “las informaciones” with “la información” and using more idiomatic verbs for “bachorear”—the text would read like a native‑crafted script.\nOverall rating (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
