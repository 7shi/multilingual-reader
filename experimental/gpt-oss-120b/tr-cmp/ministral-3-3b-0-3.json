    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand. Most sentences follow a logical order and the technical concepts are explained clearly. There are a few minor typographical errors (e.g., \"informaciónes\" instead of \"informaciones\") and occasional clumsy phrasing (e.g., \"Vea:\" and the redundant \"aprendizaje en contexto dentro del contexto\"), but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward or literal constructions that a native speaker would avoid: \"Vea:\" as a stand‑alone imperative, \"es decir, en otras palabras\" left incomplete, the duplicated definition of ICL, and the use of \"silla\" for \"saddle\". These issues slightly break the flow, though overall the text is readable.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\", and even the slang \"crunchar\" are retained or explained appropriately. The only slight inconsistency is the overly literal rendering of the ICL acronym, but the meaning is preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original intent to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using familiar analogies (consultor brillante, aprender a montar en bicicleta). Minor cultural mismatches (e.g., \"silla\" instead of a more natural \"asiento\") are present, but they do not affect the overall message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is retained. No major ideas are omitted, and the explanatory details are preserved. The only redundancy is the parenthetical expansion of ICL, which adds length but not loss of content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. It scores high on terminology and completeness, while readability and fluency are slightly lowered by minor typographical errors and a few literal or redundant phrasings. With a quick proof‑read to fix typos and smooth out the awkward sentences, the translation would be near‑perfect for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience."
