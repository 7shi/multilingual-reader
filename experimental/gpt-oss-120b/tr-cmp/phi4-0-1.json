  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained clearly. Minor long sentences do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few expressions feel awkward or overly literal: “para dársela un conocimiento general” should be “para darle una cultura general”, “Cuando refinás un modelo” uses a regional ‘‑ás’ form that may not suit all audiences, and some punctuation could be smoother. Overall, native speakers would understand it without effort, but it isn’t completely idiomatic.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled consistently and appropriately. Terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and “anclaje” are correctly rendered and maintained throughout. Only a marginal point is deducted because some translators might prefer “ajuste fino” for fine‑tuning, but “afinamiento” is acceptable.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral and the examples (consultor brillante, examen) work well in Spanish. Small phrasing choices could be refined for greater naturalness, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and nuances from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted, and no redundant or extraneous material was added.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality, conveying the technical content accurately and clearly. Readability and completeness are excellent, and terminology is consistent. Fluency could be improved with a few idiomatic adjustments, and a more neutral verb form would broaden its audience. Overall, the work is very solid and would serve Spanish‑speaking listeners well, requiring only minor edits for polish."
