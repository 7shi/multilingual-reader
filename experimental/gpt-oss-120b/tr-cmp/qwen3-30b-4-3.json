  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas are easy to follow. Sentences are not overly long and the concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can understand. Minor issues such as occasional missing spaces before punctuation do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally, but there are several spots where the wording feels a bit stiff or inconsistent. The switch between informal \"tú\" and formal \"usted\" is jarring, \"consultor temporario\" is not a common expression (\"consultor temporal\" would be better), and some sentences could be smoother. Overall it is understandable but not fully idiomatic.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are all correctly rendered and consistent throughout. The choice of \"anclaje\" for \"grounding\" is acceptable, though not the most common, and the rest of the jargon is accurate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone of a podcast conversation, but the mixed register (formal vs. informal) and a few unnatural collocations (e.g., \"consultor temporario\") reduce its cultural fit for a typical Spanish‑speaking audience. The core message is preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the examples and analogies are retained. The translation is faithful to the source content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of conveying the technical content and the overall flow of the podcast. It is mostly clear and technically accurate, but it suffers from occasional register inconsistencies and slightly awkward phrasing that prevent it from feeling completely natural to native Spanish listeners. Minor lexical tweaks (e.g., using \"consultor temporal\" and maintaining a consistent informal tone) would raise the quality significantly.\nOverall score: 17/20.\n\n**Breakdown**: Readability 17, Fluency 15, Terminology 18, Contextual Adaptation 16, Information Completeness 19. The average yields an overall rating of 17 out of 20."
