  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor typographical errors (e.g., “moldena” instead of “moldea”) and occasional missing articles do not seriously hinder comprehension, but they slightly reduce smoothness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward constructions: “moldena”, inconsistent hyphenation of “pre‑entrenamiento”, redundant phrasing “aprendizaje en contexto, o Aprendizaje en Contexto (In‑Context Learning)”, and some literal calques (“consultor brillante”). These issues make the text feel a bit stilted for native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is handled well. Key terms such as «pre‑entrenamiento», «afinamiento», «aprendizaje por transferencia», «ventana de contexto», «ICL», and «grounding» (rendered as “anclaje”) are correctly translated and used consistently. The occasional retention of English words like “prompt” is acceptable in this context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original intent and adapts idiomatic expressions appropriately (e.g., “cajas negras”, “consultor brillante”). Cultural references are neutral and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor slips (“moldena”) slightly affect the adaptation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present. No major ideas are omitted, and the added clarification about the double naming of In‑Context Learning does not cause loss of meaning. Redundancies are minimal.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is accurate and conveys the technical content effectively. It is readable and complete, with solid handling of terminology. The main drawbacks are a few typographical mistakes and some slightly unnatural phrasing that prevent it from being completely fluent. With a quick proofread these issues could be resolved, bringing the translation to a near‑native level.\n\nScore (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
