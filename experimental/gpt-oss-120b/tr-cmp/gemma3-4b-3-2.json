    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and conveys the main ideas of the original French dialogue. However, several sentences are oddly phrased (e.g., “Entrenamos una nueva IA completamente a la escuela”, “se enfoca a la mecánica cuántica”), and punctuation is inconsistent, which can momentarily disrupt comprehension. The overall logical flow is preserved, but the reader must work through a few clunky constructions.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural expressions and literal constructions that sound like a word‑for‑word rendering rather than natural Spanish. Phrases such as “optimizarlo”, “es como si lo hicieran los humanos”, and the retained English term *prompt* break the fluency. While a native speaker can grasp the meaning, the text does not read smoothly as native podcast narration.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, ventana de contexto, etc. The terms are consistent throughout the dialogue. The only minor issue is the inclusion of the meta‑comment about “optimizarlo”, which is unnecessary but does not affect the technical meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and conversational tone, but the insertion of translator notes (“Note: the Spanish language does not have the same need…”) is out of place for the target audience. Some cultural/idiomatic adaptations are missing, leading to slightly stilted sentences that feel less natural for a Spanish‑speaking podcast listener.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, short‑term vs permanent memory, and the “memory” feature. No substantive information is lost, but the extraneous translator note adds noise and a few nuances (e.g., the French “un consultant brillant” becomes “un consultor brillante” – acceptable) are slightly less polished. Overall the content is complete.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in delivering the full technical content and preserving the structure of the original dialogue, but it suffers from several stylistic and fluency issues. Literal translations and occasional awkward phrasing make the text feel artificial, and the presence of translator meta‑comments distracts from the podcast narrative. Technical terms are well‑chosen and consistent, yet the overall reading experience would benefit from a more natural, idiomatic Spanish rewrite and the removal of non‑essential editorial notes. The score reflects a competent but imperfect adaptation."
