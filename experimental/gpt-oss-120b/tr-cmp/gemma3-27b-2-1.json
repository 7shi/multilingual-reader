      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the explanations of AI concepts are clear. Listeners can follow the dialogue without confusion. Minor punctuation issues do not impede comprehension.",

    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but a few expressions are slightly awkward (e.g., “ventana contextual”, “optimización” for fine‑tuning, abbreviation “ApC”). These quirks lower the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well‑handled, but some choices are sub‑optimal: “optimización” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”, “ventana contextual” instead of “ventana de contexto”, and the unusual translation of “grounding” as “fundamentación”. Consistency suffers with the new abbreviation “ApC”.",

    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast tone, adapts cultural references (e.g., “Hola y bienvenidos a «Tecno Destello»”), and adds a helpful parenthetical clarification for the program name. The only drawback is the less‑idiomatic “fundamentación” for grounding.",
      "score": 17

    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original script is retained; no ideas are omitted or distorted. The translation includes every example and nuance present in the French source.",

    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version conveys the original content accurately and is easy to understand. Minor lexical and stylistic choices prevent it from being completely native‑like, especially regarding specific AI terminology, but the overall quality is high and suitable for a podcast audience.\n\nStrengths: clear explanations, faithful rendering of the dialogue, good cultural adaptation. Areas for improvement: refine technical vocabulary (use \"ajuste fino\", \"ventana de contexto\"), keep original abbreviations (ICL), and choose more common equivalents for terms like \"grounding\" (e.g., \"anclaje\").\n\nOverall score reflects a solid translation with room for polishing technical phrasing.\n\nScore out of 20: 17"
