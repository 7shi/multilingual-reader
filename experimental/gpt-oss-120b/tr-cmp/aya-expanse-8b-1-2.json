    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in the same order as the original French. Most sentences are clear and the concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained in language that a non‑expert can follow. A few moments, such as \"el afinamiento\" (instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\") or the phrase \"gran expansión de la memoria a corto plazo\" sound a little clunky, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural for a native Spanish speaker. The dialogue style is preserved, and idiomatic expressions like \"es como contratar a un brillante consultor\" work well. Minor issues appear: \"el preentrenamiento\" is sometimes written without hyphen (acceptable), \"memoria a corto plazo\" is technically correct but less idiomatic than \"memoria de corto plazo\". The final line \"Tech Luz\" deviates from the original \"Tech Éclair\" and feels like a mistranslation of the show’s name.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled competently. \"Pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\" (fine‑tuning), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are all correctly rendered. The abbreviation ICL is kept, which is appropriate. Some terms could be more consistent, e.g., \"memoria a corto plazo\" vs. \"ventana de contexto\" (the latter is kept). Overall, terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and tone, preserving the educational‑podcast style. Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is required. The only notable divergence is the final podcast title change to \"Tech Luz\", which loses the original wordplay on \"Éclair\" (flash/lighting). Apart from that, the adaptation is faithful.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is retained: the stages of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the notion of temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No substantive content is omitted. The minor change of the podcast name does not affect the technical content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely successful: it conveys the technical explanations clearly, uses appropriate terminology, and keeps the conversational flow. Minor stylistic glitches and the erroneous renaming of the podcast at the end prevent a perfect score, but they do not undermine the overall understanding. The text would be easily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners interested in AI concepts.\n\nStrengths: accurate technical rendering, clear exposition, natural dialogue. Weaknesses: occasional slightly awkward phrasing, inconsistent naming of the podcast, and a few less idiomatic word choices.\n\nOverall, the work is high‑quality and only needs minor polishing for full fluency and cultural nuance.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 85"
