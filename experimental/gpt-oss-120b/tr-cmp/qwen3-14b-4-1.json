  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained with clear analogies. Minor issues such as occasional long sentences and a few missing hyphens (e.g., “preentrenamiento” vs “pre‑entrenamiento”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, using appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic constructions. A few phrases feel slightly literal (“una antisècha” became “una nota”, which is acceptable but less vivid) and some sentences are a bit wordy, but overall a native Spanish speaker would find the dialogue fluent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", \"Memoria\". Consistency is maintained throughout, and no crucial term is mistranslated or omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts well to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are preserved, the podcast style is kept, and the analogies (consultant vs. expert) are rendered naturally. Slightly more idiomatic alternatives could be used in a few spots, but the overall intent is fully conveyed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No essential content is lost, and the flow of the conversation remains intact. Minor stylistic differences do not affect the completeness of the information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational tone of the podcast, and is largely readable and natural for Spanish speakers. Small stylistic tweaks could raise fluency, but the work is solid overall.\nOverall score (out of 100): 87/100."
