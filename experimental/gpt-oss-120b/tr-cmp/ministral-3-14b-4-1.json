  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is a collection of editor’s notes, alternative phrasings and meta‑comments rather than a continuous Spanish script. Readers would be confused by the abrupt switches between “Versión mejorada”, “Versión alternativa”, and explanatory brackets. The logical flow of the original podcast dialogue is lost, making it hard to understand.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Because the passage mixes many unfinished fragments, English‑Spanish borrowings, and bracketed explanations, it does not read as natural Spanish. Sentences such as “Camille: El preentrenamiento (o *entrenamiento previo*)” appear isolated, and many suggestions are left in English (e.g., “In‑Context Learning”). This results in a very awkward, non‑fluent text.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL) are mentioned, but they are inconsistently rendered and often accompanied by multiple alternative translations without a clear choice. No consistent terminology is maintained throughout, which would confuse a target audience.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation does not successfully adapt the original French podcast tone to Spanish. Cultural references are untouched, but the many meta‑instructions (“Versión más natural”, “Nota”, “Recomendación final”) are left in the text, which is inappropriate for a listener‑oriented script.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A large portion of the original content is missing or replaced by editorial notes. The core explanations about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning are fragmented, and many sentences are omitted or truncated, so the information is incomplete.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The supplied ‘translation’ is essentially a work‑in‑progress document containing numerous editorial suggestions, placeholders, and alternative phrasings rather than a finished Spanish version of the podcast. As such, it fails to deliver a readable, fluent, and complete rendering of the original French dialogue. Significant editing, consolidation of the chosen wording, removal of meta‑comments, and a consistent terminology strategy are required before it can be considered a proper translation.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 4.4 → rounded to 4 out of 20."
