    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the logical flow of the dialogue is preserved. Most sentences are easy to follow, and the technical ideas are explained in an accessible way. The only notable issue is the stray line “Camille: syntaxe” which is untranslated and confusing, and occasional meta‑comments that interrupt the narrative.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, using appropriate Spanish structures and vocabulary. A few constructions feel slightly stiff (e.g., “a partir de ahí, exponerlo a una cantidad mucho menor de texto”) and the inserted explanatory note about the term *prompt* breaks the flow. The leftover English word “syntax” also reduces fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is well‑handled: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, grounding, etc. English terms are kept in italics or explained, which is helpful for readers familiar with the field. Minor inconsistency in translating “fine‑tuning” but overall consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the educational analogies work well. The untranslated “syntax” line and the parenthetical note about *prompt* are the only mismatches.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present: explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No major content is omitted, aside from the stray “syntax” line which does not affect the overall message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is very good. It accurately renders the technical content and maintains the conversational style of the podcast. Minor issues such as an untranslated fragment, a few slightly awkward phrasings, and a meta‑note that interrupts the flow prevent a perfect score, but they do not hinder comprehension. The handling of terminology is strong, and the adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience is effective.\n\nScore (out of 100): 84/100"
