    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is difficult to follow because it mixes the original dialogue with extensive meta‑comments, alternative phrasings and editorial notes. Sentences are often overly long and include parenthetical explanations that break the flow. A reader who just wants to understand the podcast content would have to filter out the additional material, which lowers overall comprehensibility.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the vocabulary is generally correct, the phrasing frequently sounds stilted or unnatural for a spoken podcast. Examples include “pre-entrenamiento” (should be *preentrenamiento*), “procesamiento de contexto” instead of the more common *memoria de contexto*, and many literal translations that do not respect Spanish idiomatic usage. The abundance of parenthetical clauses further hampers smoothness.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)* and *grounding* are generally rendered correctly and consistently. However, the translation sometimes adds unnecessary explanations (e.g., “(Variante más técnica para contextos especializados)”) that are not part of the original and can confuse the reader. Overall, the core terminology is appropriate but the handling is cluttered.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original conversational tone is lost; the Spanish version reads more like a technical manual interspersed with translation advice. Cultural adaptation is minimal, and the added instructional sections (e.g., “Opcional: Si se prefiere…”) are irrelevant to the intended audience of a podcast. Consequently, the intent and purpose of the original are not fully conveyed.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Significant portions of the original dialogue are either omitted or replaced by meta commentary. The final closing lines of the podcast are missing, and many of the back‑and‑forth exchanges are truncated or rewritten with added explanatory content that was not present in the source. This leads to loss of information and adds redundancy.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation provided is more of a hybrid between a literal translation and an editorial guide than a faithful rendering of the original podcast script. It includes extensive side notes, alternative phrasing suggestions, and explanatory brackets that distract from the core dialogue. While the technical terminology is mostly correct, the overall readability, fluency, and completeness suffer because of the added material and unnatural phrasing. A cleaner, dialogue‑focused translation that preserves the conversational tone and removes the meta commentary would be far more suitable for the target audience."
