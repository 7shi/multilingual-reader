    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, but several interruptions break the flow. The stray French phrase “¿C’est?” and the inserted meta‑commentary about “Contextual interpretation” are confusing for a reader. Some sentences keep French words (e.g., “Voyez plutôt”) or awkward constructions (“Camille: Donc, después del pre‑entrenamiento…”) that require extra mental effort. Overall, a native reader can grasp the main ideas, but the occasional gibberish and mixed‑language fragments reduce smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation sounds natural, but there are noticeable awkward spots. Phrases like “Puedes usar un modelo experto en inglés, y luego exponerlo a una cantidad mucho menor de texto en francés” are acceptable, yet the presence of French interjections, the incorrect “Exattamente”, and the literal retention of “Voyez plutôt” feel out of place. The inconsistent use of italics for *prompt* and occasional literal translations (e.g., “¿C’est?”) make the text feel less polished. Hence fluency is moderate, not fully native‑like.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally well handled: pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding → anclaje, etc. The translator kept the English “fine‑tuning” in italics, which is common. However, occasional inconsistency (mixing French “Voyez plutôt” with Spanish) and the unnecessary inclusion of meta‑commentary about translation choices detract from a clean terminology presentation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator succeeded in preserving the original podcast’s explanatory tone and analogies (physicist, consultant). Cultural references remain neutral and appropriate. Nevertheless, the leftover French expressions and the unexplained “¿C’est?” break the adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Some sentences could be smoother (e.g., replacing “exponerlo a una cantidad” with “alimentarlo con una cantidad”). Overall the intent is conveyed, but adaptation is imperfect.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All core ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. No major factual omissions are detected. The only drawback is the insertion of extraneous translation‑process commentary that does not belong to the original dialogue, which adds noise rather than omitting content.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the main technical content and maintains the podcast’s conversational style, but it is marred by several copy‑and‑paste artefacts (French fragments, meta‑commentary) and occasional unnatural phrasing. While a Spanish‑speaking reader will understand the discussion, the presence of out‑of‑place terms and inconsistent language lowers the overall quality. A careful proofreading to remove the stray French bits and to smooth awkward sentences would raise the score substantially.\n\n**Overall score (average):** 13.4 / 20"
