  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the logical flow of the dialogue is preserved. However, several sentences are clunky or overly literal (e.g., “Entrenamos una nueva IA completamente a la escuela…”, “es una memoria de un solo uso”). These constructions may cause a brief pause for the reader, lowering the smoothness of comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are recurring awkward expressions and unnecessary insertions such as “optimizarlo” and the literal rendering of “prompt”. Some gender agreements and verb choices feel off (“Ella olvida todo”). These issues prevent the text from feeling fully native‑like.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje (grounding) are all correctly rendered. The term “prompt” is left in English with italics, which is acceptable for a technical audience. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original podcast script are preserved, and the translation respects Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor issues remain, such as the literal footnote about “optimizarlo” that feels out of place in a spoken script, but overall the cultural adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French version is present; no major ideas are omitted. The only extra element is the explanatory note about the optional “optimizarlo” which does not alter the factual content. The translation therefore remains complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and keeps the structure of the dialogue, which is a strong point. Nevertheless, the prose suffers from occasional literalness and awkward phrasing that affect readability and fluency. Technical terminology is well‑managed, and the message is fully retained. With minor stylistic polishing, the translation would reach a higher level of naturalness for Spanish‑speaking audiences.\n\nOverall rating (average of the five criteria): 16/20.\n\nScore: 16"
