  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the dialogue flow can be followed. Most sentences are understandable, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can grasp. However, there are a few awkward phrasings (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenido en…\", \"desempolvar la forma\") that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural to native speakers: \"desempolvar la forma\", \"rep aprender\", \"bachear para un examen\", \"antiespia\" and \"sillita\" are either literal translations or colloquialisms that do not fit the context. Grammar is mostly correct, but the lexical choices reduce overall fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" and \"grounding\" are correctly retained or translated. Consistency is good, and the translator kept the jargon appropriate for a tech‑savvy audience. Minor issues like leaving \"grounding\" untranslated in parentheses do not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and purpose, but some cultural/idiomatic choices are off (e.g., \"bachear\", \"antiespia\", \"sillita\"). These choices may confuse some Spanish‑speaking listeners. Overall the message is preserved, yet a more natural cultural adaptation would improve it.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue turns and key ideas from the French source are present. No major sections are omitted, and the logical structure remains intact. Minor lexical mistakes do not cause loss of information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in delivering the full content and technical depth of the original podcast script. Readability and terminology are solid, but fluency suffers from several literal translations and odd colloquialisms that make the text feel less natural to native Spanish speakers. A careful revision of idiomatic expressions would raise the overall quality.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
