    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and the flow of the dialogue is preserved. Most sentences are clear and the technical ideas are explained in a way that a non‑expert can grasp. However, occasional French words (e.g., *bachotage*, *C’est une excellente remarque*) interrupt the reading experience and may confuse readers who do not know French.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward constructions and lexical choices that betray a literal translation. Examples include \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotage\" (mixing French), \"Ventana de contexto\" (acceptable but less common than *ventana de contexto*), and the retention of the French interjection \"C’est une excellente remarque\". These reduce the overall smoothness for native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto* and *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)* are correctly rendered and consistently used. The only drawback is the occasional fallback to French jargon (*bachotage*) instead of a Spanish equivalent (*estudio intensivo*, *memorización*), which slightly harms precision.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely preserves the intent and tone of the original podcast. It adapts the examples to Spanish‑speaking listeners, but the presence of untranslated French fragments shows a missed opportunity for full cultural adaptation. Additionally, some idiomatic Spanish could have been used to make the consulting analogy smoother.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the substantive information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the logical progression of pre‑training → fine‑tuning → in‑context learning is intact. The only minor loss is the nuance carried by the untranslated French remark, which does not affect the core content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original content accurately and retains the technical depth required for the audience. It is readable and mostly fluent, but the occasional retention of French words and a few literal‑translation artifacts prevent it from being fully natural for Spanish speakers. Improving those spots and ensuring every segment is fully rendered in Spanish would raise the quality to an excellent level.\n\n**Strengths**: correct handling of key technical terminology, faithful transmission of concepts, good structure.\n**Areas for improvement**: eliminate French remnants, refine awkward phrasing, replace \"bachotage\" with a Spanish equivalent, and polish idiomatic expressions.\n\n**Final recommendation**: The translation is good and usable after minor post‑editing to address the mixed‑language issues."
