  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑specialist can understand. A few long sentences and occasional redundancy make the flow slightly heavy, but overall a Spanish‑speaking reader can grasp the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, using appropriate Spanish vocabulary and idiomatic constructions. Minor awkwardness appears in repetitions (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto es un aprendizaje temporal”) and in slightly literal renderings of French‑style phrasing (“Tecnología Claro”, “Iluminación Tecnológica”). Nevertheless, the text sounds like a native speaker wrote it.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (In‑Context Learning), anclaje, etc. The English acronyms are preserved with explanations, which is helpful. Consistency is maintained throughout, and no key term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using familiar expressions and cultural references. The only notable deviation is the translation of the podcast title “Tech Éclair” to “Tecnología Claro” and later “Iluminación Tecnológica”, which changes the original branding and could confuse listeners. Apart from that, the intent and tone are preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original script is retained. No major ideas are omitted, and the explanations remain intact. Minor redundancies (repeating the English term for In‑Context Learning) do not affect completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and reads fairly naturally, with only small issues related to stylistic consistency and the handling of the podcast’s proper name. The translation would be easily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners and preserves the educational tone of the original podcast script.\n\nStrengths: correct terminology, thorough coverage of concepts, clear explanations. Areas for improvement: keep the original program title unchanged, avoid slight repetitions, and smooth out a few overly literal phrasings.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17 out of 20.)"
