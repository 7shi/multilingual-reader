  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the dialogue clearly. Sentences are well‑structured and the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are easy to follow for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor punctuation quirks (missing opening exclamation in the first greeting) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the text reads naturally. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic, and the speakers’ tone matches the original podcast style. Small issues such as an extra space before \"!\" (\"¡Exactamente !\") and a slightly stiff \"Hola y bienvenida\" prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". No term is left ambiguous and the abbreviations are preserved, which is suitable for the target readership.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content to Spanish cultural and linguistic norms. The use of \"consultor\" instead of \"consultant\" and the handling of gendered language (\"bienvenida\" for Camille) show good adaptation. No cultural references are lost.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French script is present. No sentences or nuances are omitted, and the flow of the dialogue remains intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version is a high‑quality translation that preserves the educational tone and technical depth of the original podcast. Minor punctuation and stylistic tweaks would push it to an even higher level of polish, but the content is accurate, fluent, and fully understandable for the intended audience.\nOverall rating: 18/20."
