    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure. However, there are several grammatical slips (e.g., \"El afinación\" instead of \"La afinación\"), inconsistent use of formal and informal pronouns, and a stray comma that slightly hampers flow. The mistranslation of ICL as \"Inteligencia Computacional Linguística\" may confuse readers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds fairly natural but contains awkward phrasing and mismatched registers. Examples include the incorrect article before \"afinación\", the unnecessary comma in \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es...\", and the mix of \"tú\" and \"usted\". The final line reverts to the French title, breaking the linguistic consistency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\". The term \"grounding\" is left in English, which is acceptable, but the definition of ICL is inaccurate (\"Inteligencia Computacional Linguística\" is not the standard translation). Overall terminology is adequate but not flawless.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational podcast tone is largely preserved, and the translation adapts cultural references appropriately. The main issue is the inconsistent level of formality (mix of \"tú\" and \"usted\") which feels out of place for an informal podcast. The occasional retention of the French title also detracts from full adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the original script are present. No significant sections are omitted. The only drawback is the erroneous expansion of the acronym ICL, which could mislead readers about the concept, but the core information remains intact.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content with good fidelity and remains largely clear to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor grammatical errors, inconsistent register, and a few inaccurate technical renderings (notably the ICL definition) prevent it from being fully polished. With a few revisions—correcting article usage, harmonising pronouns, fixing the ICL expansion, and ensuring consistent branding—the text would reach a high level of naturalness and precision.\nOverall score: 73/100."
