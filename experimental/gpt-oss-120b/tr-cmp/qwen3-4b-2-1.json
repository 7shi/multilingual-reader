  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. The ideas are presented in a logical order and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained clearly. There are a few minor hiccups such as \"bienvenido en\" instead of \"bienvenido a\" and a stray comma in \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es bachotaje\", but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few literal renderings feel slightly awkward to native speakers (e.g., \"afinamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\", \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\"). Punctuation errors and duplicated words (\"anclaje (anclaje)\") also affect smoothness. Overall, the text reads well enough for a podcast script.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly translated: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\". The choice of \"afinamiento\" for \"fine‑tuning\" is understandable but less idiomatic than \"ajuste fino\". The term \"grounding\" is rendered as \"anclaje\", which is acceptable, though the duplicate parenthetical is unnecessary. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original tone to Spanish well, using appropriate register for a podcast (conversational, inclusive). Cultural references are neutral and the analogies (consultor brillante, aprender a montar en bicicleta) work in Spanish. Minor phrasing issues do not affect the conveyed intent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the flow of the discussion is preserved. The only redundancy is the double \"anclaje (anclaje)\" which does not remove information but is a slight stylistic flaw.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Readability and completeness are strong, while fluency and terminology could be polished by using more idiomatic expressions such as \"ajuste fino\" and fixing minor punctuation and duplication errors. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a podcast transcript, needing only light editing for native‑speaker polish.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 16.6 ≈ 17/20.\n\nScore: 17"
