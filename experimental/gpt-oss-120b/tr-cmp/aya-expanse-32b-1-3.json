  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear order. Sentences are generally not overly long, and the podcast‑style explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are easy to follow for a non‑expert audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for native Spanish speakers. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. Minor awkwardness appears in a few places (e.g., \"El afinamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\", and a slightly clunky clause \"simplemente, su espacio de trabajo temporal ha sido vaciado\"), but these do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL), \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\", etc. The loan‑word \"prompt\" is left unchanged, which is acceptable. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references (e.g., using \"consultor\" and \"experto\"). The tone remains conversational and fits a podcast audience. The only slight mismatch is retaining the French title \"Tech Éclair\" at the end, but this is a deliberate brand choice and does not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the concept of temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of \"memoria\" features. No notable omissions or distortions are detected.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, reads smoothly, and is easily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor lexical choices could be refined, but they do not detract from the overall effectiveness of the translation.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 18/20, Fluency 18/20, Terminology 17/20, Contextual Adaptation 18/20, Information Completeness 19/20. The average yields an overall rating of 18/20.\n\nOverall score (average): 18/20.\n\nThe translation successfully maintains the educational and conversational tone of the original podcast while delivering the technical concepts in clear, natural Spanish.\n\n---\n**Detailed Reasoning**\n- Readability: Clear structure, logical progression, easy for non‑technical listeners.\n- Fluency: Natural phrasing, occasional minor awkwardness.\n- Terminology: Correct technical vocab, consistent, occasional less‑common synonym.\n- Contextual Adaptation: Good cultural adaptation, maintains original intent.\n- Information Completeness: No loss of meaning, all points covered.\n- Overall: Strong translation with only small stylistic tweaks needed."
