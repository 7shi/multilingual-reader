    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is clear and the dialogue flows logically. Most sentences are easy to understand, and the technical ideas are explained in a straightforward way. There are a few long sentences that could be split for easier reading, but overall the content is comprehensible to the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text generally sounds natural, but some word choices feel awkward for native speakers (e.g., “fundamentación” for grounding, “perfeccionamiento” for fine‑tuning, and “le hemos proporcionado un atajo”). Minor grammatical slips such as “evoluciona de tus conversaciones” slightly reduce fluency. Nevertheless, the translation is intelligible and maintains a conversational tone.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”. The translation of fine‑tuning as “perfeccionamiento” is understandable but not the most common term (\"ajuste fino\"). “Grounding” is rendered as “fundamentación”, which is not standard and may confuse readers. Consistency is maintained across the script.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the informal podcast style and adapted greetings and cultural references appropriately (e.g., “¡Hola a todos!”). The only minor mismatch is keeping the original French show name at the very end, which could be slightly jarring but does not affect overall intent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French version is present in the Spanish version. No key points, examples, or analogies have been omitted, and the dialogue structure is intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original content accurately and maintains the conversational tone of the podcast. Technical concepts are well explained, and the dialogue remains engaging. The main weaknesses lie in a few non‑standard term choices and occasional phrasing that sounds slightly forced to native speakers. With minor lexical adjustments, the translation would be near‑perfect.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 16.4 → rounded to 16/20."
