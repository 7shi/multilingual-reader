  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto are explained clearly. Minor repetitions of \"por lo tanto\" and occasional long sentences slightly reduce flow, but overall the reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native speaker in most places. There are a few literal renderings (e.g., \"ha sido vaciado\" for \"has simply been emptied\", \"chuleta\" for \"cheat‑sheet\") that feel a bit colloquial or stiff, but they do not break comprehension. Overall the language is smooth and appropriate for a podcast script.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje (grounding)\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"memoria\" are all rendered with the usual Spanish equivalents. Consistency is maintained throughout the dialogue.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The metaphor of a \"consultor brillante\" and the use of \"chuleta\" are appropriate and convey the same nuance as the French. Minor literal translations exist but do not hinder the message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is preserved. No sentences or ideas are omitted, and the technical explanations remain intact. The translation also avoids unnecessary redundancy while keeping the content complete.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is highly accurate and comprehensive. It conveys the technical content of the podcast clearly, uses appropriate terminology, and maintains the conversational tone of the original. A few spots feel slightly literal or overly formal, but they do not detract significantly from the overall quality. The work would be very effective for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 88 / 100 → 17.6 ≈ 18 / 20."
