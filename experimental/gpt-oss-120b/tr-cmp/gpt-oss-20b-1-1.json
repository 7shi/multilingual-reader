  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow and the dialogue flow mirrors the original. Most sentences are clear, and the technical ideas are presented in understandable language. Minor hiccups such as occasional long sentences and a few punctuation choices prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, but there are some awkward constructions (e.g., \"Usted ha entendido todo\", mixing of \"tú\" and \"Usted\", and occasional literal renderings). These affect the smoothness a bit.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, etc. The terminology is consistent throughout and appropriate for a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent, tone, and explanatory style of the original podcast are well preserved. The translation does not introduce cultural references that would be confusing, though the mixed use of formal/informal pronouns slightly detracts from a fully adapted text.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is accurate and conveys the original content effectively. It excels in terminology handling and completeness. Minor issues with pronoun consistency and a few unnatural phrasing choices keep it just shy of perfection, but the text is still very readable and informative for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\nScore breakdown: readability 16, fluency 15, terminology 18, contextual adaptation 16, information completeness 20. The average yields an overall score of 17/20."
