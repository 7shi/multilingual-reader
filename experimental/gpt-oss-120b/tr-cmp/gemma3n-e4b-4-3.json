    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and conveys the dialogue clearly. Most sentences are well‑structured, and complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained in plain language. Minor issues affect readability: the opening “¡Bonjour y bienvenido” mixes French and Spanish, and the alternation between “afinamiento” and “ajuste fino” may cause a brief moment of confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, but there are a few awkward spots that native speakers would notice. Examples include the mixed‑language greeting, the use of “vuestras conversaciones” (vosotros) while the rest of the text uses “sus”, and occasional literal renderings like “*prompt*”. These do not break comprehension but reduce the smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely accurate: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, ICL, ventana de contexto, anclaje a datos, etc. Consistency could be improved (e.g., sticking to “afinamiento” instead of switching to “ajuste fino”). Keeping the English word “prompt” is acceptable in a technical podcast, but a Spanish equivalent could be added for completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content well to a Spanish‑speaking audience, preserving the educational tone and analogies. Cultural adaptation is solid except for the opening bilingual greeting, which feels out of place, and the occasional use of the second‑person plural “vuestras” that does not match the rest of the text.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present. No ideas are omitted, and the explanations of pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, and the “memoria” feature are fully retained. The translation adds no unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality and faithfully reproduces the original podcast script. It successfully conveys complex AI concepts in an accessible way for Spanish listeners. Minor inconsistencies (mixed language greeting, term variation, occasional regional pronoun choice) keep the score from being perfect, but they do not hinder comprehension. With a few stylistic tweaks the translation would be near‑flawless.\n\nFinal averaged score (rounded): 17/20.\n\nScore (average of the five criteria): 17"
