  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are not overly long and the logical flow mirrors the original. A few minor issues (repetition of “aprendizaje en contexto”, occasional heavy punctuation) slightly affect smoothness, but overall a reader can comprehend the discussion without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most part, but there are occasional awkward constructions (e.g., “Este enfoque se llama aprendizaje en contexto, o Aprendizaje en Contexto (ICL)”, “Se podría decir”, “Es una excelente observación”). Vocabulary is appropriate, yet the occasional literal translation reduces the native feel.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento* (ajuste fino), *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)*, and *anclaje* for grounding are correctly rendered and used consistently. The translation respects the jargon expected by a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone. Cultural references are minimal, and the Spanish version adapts expressions suitably for the target audience. Minor literal renderings (e.g., “consultor brillante” vs. a more idiomatic “consultor experto”) keep the meaning intact but could be smoother.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as in the source. Redundancies are not introduced, and the core concepts are fully retained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. Readability and terminology are strong points, while fluency could be polished by smoothing a few literal phrases. The translation succeeds in delivering the original podcast’s educational tone to Spanish‑speaking listeners, with only minor stylistic hiccups that prevent a perfect score."
