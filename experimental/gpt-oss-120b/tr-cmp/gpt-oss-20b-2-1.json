  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the complex concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning) are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. Minor issues arise from inconsistent use of formal/informal pronouns (\"Usted\" vs \"tú\") which can momentarily confuse the reader, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and the flow is smooth. A few expressions feel slightly awkward or overly formal for a podcast style (e.g., \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\", \"hoja de trucos\"), and the mix of \"tú\" and \"Usted\" breaks the colloquial tone. Nevertheless, native speakers would understand it without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\" (acceptable alternative to \"ajuste fino\"), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\", \"grounding\" (explained as \"anclaje (grounding)\"). The terms are used consistently throughout the translation.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and purpose of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral and appropriate for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The only drawback is the inconsistent register (formal vs. informal), which slightly reduces the adaptation to a conversational podcast style.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No key points are omitted, and no redundant or extraneous material has been added. The content remains faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality and faithfully conveys the original French podcast script. It is clear, technically accurate, and retains the educational tone. Minor improvements could be made by standardising the pronoun usage and slightly smoothing a few formal‑sounding phrases to better match the informal podcast style. These adjustments would raise the fluency and readability scores a bit further.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
