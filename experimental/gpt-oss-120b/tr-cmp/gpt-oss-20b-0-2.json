    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are not overly long and the technical concepts are explained with clear examples (e.g., the English‑to‑French transfer). Minor issues such as a switch from informal \"tú\" to formal \"Usted\" and occasional punctuation quirks slightly disturb the flow, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward spots: the sudden use of \"Usted\" in an otherwise informal podcast, the phrase \"El aprendizaje en contexto es bachotaje\" which, while understandable, is not a common colloquial expression, and the inconsistency between \"ajuste fino\" and \"afinamiento\". Overall, a native speaker would understand everything, but the prose could be smoother.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\". However, the translation keeps the French word \"ancrage\" (with an English parenthesis) instead of using a Spanish equivalent such as \"anclaje\" or \"fundamentación\", and alternates between \"ajuste fino\" and \"afinamiento\", which may confuse readers. Consistency and full localization of terminology would improve the score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent—explaining the difference between fine‑tuning and in‑context learning—is preserved. The conversational tone is mostly kept, with appropriate exclamations (\"¡Exactamente!\") and relatable analogies. The only drawback is the occasional shift in register (formal \"Usted\"), which slightly weakens the cultural adaptation for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant information is lost or added. All examples, analogies, and explanations from the French source appear in the Spanish version. The translation does not introduce redundancy and remains faithful to the original content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does an excellent job of conveying the original podcast’s content and educational value. Readability and completeness are strong points, and the technical ideas are communicated clearly. Fluency and terminology could be refined: maintain a consistent informal register, choose Spanish equivalents for retained foreign terms, and use a single translation for \"fine‑tuning\". With those adjustments, the translation would feel completely natural to a Spanish‑speaking audience while preserving the technical precision of the source."
