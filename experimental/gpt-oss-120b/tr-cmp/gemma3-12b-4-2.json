  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear order. Most sentences are easy to follow, and the technical concepts are explained with sufficient context. A few long sentences could be split for easier reading, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds largely natural to a native Spanish speaker. Minor awkwardness appears in phrases such as “la fase de pre‑entrenamiento” (more common would be *preentrenamiento*) and “fundamentación” for the term *grounding*. Nevertheless, the language is smooth and idiomatic in most places.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)*, etc. Consistency is maintained throughout. The only slight deviation is the translation of *grounding* as “fundamentación”, which is understandable but less standard than alternatives like “anclaje”.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts the discourse to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the explanatory tone is maintained. Some literal translations (e.g., “estudiar a marchas forzadas”) are acceptable, though a more colloquial Spanish expression could be used. Overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is retained. No major ideas or examples are omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as the source. The only tiny loss is the nuanced parenthetical comment about “une compétence permanente” being “parte integrante de su identidad”, which is still conveyed adequately.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality: it conveys the technical content accurately, remains readable, and generally sounds natural in Spanish. Minor stylistic tweaks (especially for a few lexical choices) would push it closer to native fluency, but the current version is fully functional and faithful to the original dialogue.\nOverall score: 89/100."
