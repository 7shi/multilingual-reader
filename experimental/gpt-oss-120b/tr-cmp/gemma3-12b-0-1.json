  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the dialogue format is preserved, making the content comprehensible for a native speaker. Minor issues such as the French‑derived word *bachotage* and occasional long sentences slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are a few awkward calques (e.g., *es del bachotage*, *una forma astuta*). Some punctuation and phrasing choices (like *Miren:* and keeping *grounding* in parentheses) feel slightly foreign, preventing a fully native flow.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered (*pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)*). The main drawback is the retention of the French word *bachotage* instead of a Spanish equivalent, and the occasional mixing of English/French tags, which could confuse readers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and adapts analogies (e.g., *consultor brillante*) appropriately for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Cultural references are maintained, but the lingering French terms slightly reduce the adaptation’s seamlessness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas, examples, and explanations from the French script are present. No significant information is omitted, and the dialogue’s logical progression is retained. Redundancy is minimal.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation does an excellent job of preserving the technical content and conversational tone of the original French podcast. It is largely readable and accurate, with only a few lexical choices that betray the source language (notably the use of *bachotage* and occasional English/French tags). These minor slips prevent the text from reaching a fully native, polished Spanish style, but they do not impede understanding. The translation would benefit from replacing French‑specific terms with Spanish equivalents and smoothing a few awkward phrases, after which it would be near‑perfect for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 16, Fluency 15, Terminology 14, Contextual Adaptation 15, Information Completeness 18. The average yields an overall rating of 16/20."
