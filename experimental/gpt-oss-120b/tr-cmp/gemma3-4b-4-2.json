  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is riddled with broken sentences, stray quotation marks, and leftover fragments from the original French (e.g., \"Exactamente. Y este aprendizaje comienza con un proceso llamado el pre-entrenamiento.”\" and \"Luc: Exactamente. Y este aprendizaje comienza con un proceso llamado el aprendizaje previo.”). These artifacts make it difficult for a reader to follow the dialogue. The flow is interrupted by random braces and punctuation, causing confusion.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many expressions are literal translations that sound unnatural in Spanish (e.g., \"la gran capacidad de memoria a corto plazo de la IA, también conocida como ‘ventana de contexto’\" and \"una forma sutil y efectiva de aprendizaje contextual automatizado\"). Grammar errors (missing articles, wrong verb tenses) and inconsistent use of punctuation further reduce fluency. The text does not read as a smooth conversation between two native speakers.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"grounding\" are present, but their handling is inconsistent. Some terms remain in French or English, others are oddly translated (e.g., \"optimización\" for \"affinage\" which is acceptable, but later \"ancrage\" is left untranslated). No consistent glossary or explanations are provided, which can confuse readers unfamiliar with the jargon.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation does not adapt cultural references or idiomatic expressions to Spanish‑speaking audiences. It also retains many French‑style constructions and even some English words. The intent of the original podcast – a clear, engaging explanation – is lost due to the noisy formatting and lack of smooth adaptation.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Important parts of the original dialogue are either omitted or severely garbled. Several sentences are cut off mid‑thought, brackets and stray characters appear, and some explanatory sentences are missing entirely (e.g., the detailed analogy about consultants). Consequently, the Spanish version does not convey the full content of the French source.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is far from publishable. It suffers from numerous typographical artifacts, broken sentence structures, inconsistent terminology, and loss of content. A thorough re‑translation by a fluent Spanish speaker with attention to technical accuracy and natural dialogue flow is required. The current version would confuse listeners and fails to preserve the educational tone of the original podcast.\nOverall score (out of 20): 5"
