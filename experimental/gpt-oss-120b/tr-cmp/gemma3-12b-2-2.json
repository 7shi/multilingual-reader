  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences are easy to follow, and technical concepts are explained in simple terms. However, the passage about “grounding” contains an editor’s note with three alternative translations, which disrupts the flow and may confuse readers. A few minor grammatical slips (e.g., “la información que son relevantes”) also slightly affect readability.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and the style matches a podcast script. There are only a handful of awkward phrases and regional variations (e.g., “Imaginad”, “treta”) that do not break comprehension but are slightly informal. Overall fluency is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, prompt, grounding, etc. Consistency is maintained throughout. The only minor issue is keeping the English word “grounding” in parentheses, which is acceptable in a tech context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the content well to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using idiomatic expressions (e.g., “estudiar a marchas forzadas”) and culturally neutral references. The extra explanatory note about translation options is out of place and detracts from adaptation.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the original information is present; no substantive content is omitted. The only problem is the unnecessary editorial comment in the grounding line, which adds noise rather than missing information. Minor grammatical errors do not affect the conveyed facts.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is accurate, clear and conveys the technical discussion effectively. It reads naturally and uses appropriate terminology, making the podcast content accessible to Spanish listeners. The main flaw is the inclusion of an editor’s note in the middle of the dialogue, which breaks the narrative flow, and a few minor grammatical slips. Removing the note and correcting the small errors would bring the translation to an excellent level.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria, rounded): 17/20."
