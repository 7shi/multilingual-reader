    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and conveys the main ideas of the podcast. However, there are several artefacts left from the source (e.g., “Camille: syntaxe”, “Camille: translation”, “Luc: translation”) and an unnecessary “OR” note that interrupts the flow. These remnants force the reader to pause and infer the intended meaning, slightly lowering readability.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural, but the presence of untranslated fragments, footnote‑style explanations inside the dialogue, and occasional clumsy phrasing (e.g., “Es lógico. Además, como ya discutimos…”) make the translation feel less smooth than a native‑written script. The overall fluency is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: pre‑training → entrenamiento previo, fine‑tuning → ajuste fino, transfer learning → aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, grounding, etc. The decision to keep “prompt” in English with a short note is acceptable. Minor slips such as the stray French word “syntaxe” and the untranslated placeholder reduce consistency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using appropriate register and providing clarifications where needed. Nevertheless, the inclusion of meta‑comments (e.g., the “OR” alternative) and leftover placeholders detracts from a fully polished adaptation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are retained, including the distinctions between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning, as well as the discussion about “memory” features. The only losses are the untranslated fragments mentioned above, which are minor. No crucial information is omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and is largely readable for Spanish speakers. It would benefit from a final proofread to remove leftover placeholders, stray French words, and unnecessary editorial notes, which would improve fluency and readability. Overall, it is a solid translation with room for polishing.\n\nScore summary (out of 100): 74/100."
