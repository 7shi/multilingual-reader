    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original. Most sentences are easy to understand, and technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can follow. However, there is a duplicated line (Luc’s sentence about providing information) and occasional awkward phrasing such as “las informaciones”, which slightly hampers smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most part, using appropriate colloquial expressions (“¡Exactamente!”, “¡Una analogía perfecta!”). Some constructions feel a bit stilted (e.g., repetition of the definition of ICL, use of “el ajuste” instead of “el ajuste fino”, and the plural “informaciones”). These issues prevent a fully native‑like fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje, etc. The terms are consistent throughout, and English abbreviations are kept with Spanish explanations. Minor inconsistencies (use of “ajuste” and plural “informaciones”) do not seriously affect comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast’s informal, conversational tone and adapts cultural markers (e.g., use of “consultor” and “bachelor”). The intent of each segment is kept intact. The duplicated line is a minor defect, but overall the adaptation to Spanish‑speaking listeners is successful.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. No substantive information is lost, though the repeated line adds redundancy.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original content accurately and maintains the educational, friendly tone of the podcast. The main shortcomings are a duplicated sentence, occasional non‑native phrasing, and minor lexical choices (e.g., ‘informaciones’). These issues prevent a perfect score but do not impede comprehension. The technical terminology is appropriate and consistent, and the adaptation to Spanish listeners is effective. With a few edits to remove duplication and smooth out awkward expressions, the translation would be excellent.\n\nFinal score (out of 100): 82/100."
