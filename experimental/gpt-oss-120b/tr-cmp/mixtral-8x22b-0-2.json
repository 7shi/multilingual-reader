    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Sentences are mostly well‑structured, making the technical discussion easy to follow for a native reader. A few long sentences could be split, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, but there are occasional Anglicisms or French remnants (e.g., “cheat sheet”, “ancrage (grounding)”, “pre‑entrenamiento” with hyphen, “Imagínese” instead of the more common “Imagínate”). These minor slips prevent a perfect native‑like flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (In‑Context Learning)”. The only inconsistency is keeping the French word *ancrage* instead of using the Spanish *anclaje* or *enraizamiento*. Otherwise the terminology is precise and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original podcast tone and adapts cultural references for a Spanish‑speaking audience (e.g., “como contratar un consultor brillante”). The only drawback is the occasional retention of French/English terms that may feel out‑of‑place for some readers.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas from the French source are preserved. No important detail is omitted, and the examples remain intact. Minor stylistic redundancies are present but do not affect the completeness of the information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical concepts clearly, retains the conversational style of the podcast, and includes virtually all the original information. Small issues with occasional Anglicisms/French terms and a few slightly awkward phrasings keep it from being perfect, but the text is fully understandable and faithful to the source.\n\nStrengths: accurate terminology, clear exposition, good adaptation of the podcast tone.\nWeaknesses: occasional non‑native phrasing and retention of source‑language jargon.\n\nThe translation would be excellent for a Spanish‑speaking audience after a light copy‑edit to replace the few foreign remnants and smooth out the minor awkward constructions.\n\nScore out of 100: 88/100."
