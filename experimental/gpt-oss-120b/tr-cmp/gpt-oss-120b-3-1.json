  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are generally logical and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are clear. A few sentences are long, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker. Minor awkwardness appears in phrases like \"es una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\" and the occasional hyphenated term, but overall the flow is smooth and the vocabulary is appropriate for a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, anclaje, ventana de contexto, etc. The same terms are used consistently throughout, and where necessary (e.g., \"grounding\") an adequate Spanish equivalent is provided.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The tone of a podcast dialogue is preserved, with informal interjections (\"chuleta\", \"¡Exacto!\") that fit Spanish‑speaking audiences. Cultural references are neutral, and the translation respects the original intent without adding or removing nuance.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and analogies from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No important detail is omitted, and the content remains concise while retaining the original meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, reads naturally, and maintains the conversational podcast style. A few stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but the work is solid and reliable for Spanish‑speaking listeners interested in AI concepts.\n\nStrengths: correct terminology, faithful rendering of examples, clear explanations. Minor issues: occasional overly long sentences and a slightly clunky phrase in the memory‑function explanation.\n\nScore out of 20 (average): 17.4 → 17."
