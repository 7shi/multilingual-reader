  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the concepts are explained in a way that a Spanish‑speaking audience can grasp without difficulty. The only minor issue is the shift to the formal ‘Usted’ in a context that feels more conversational, but it does not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part. Vocabulary and grammar are appropriate, and idiomatic expressions are used correctly. Small awkwardness appears in a few spots (e.g., \"Usted ha comprendido todo\" vs. a more informal \"Has comprendido todo\", and the regional term \"bachotaje\"), but these do not significantly break the flow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled accurately: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\", \"grounding\", \"anclaje\" are all correctly rendered and used consistently throughout the text.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of the podcast, adapting cultural references appropriately. The formal \"Usted\" slightly changes the register, and the word \"bachotaje\" is more common in certain Spanish‑speaking regions, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No information from the original French script is lost. All examples, analogies, and explanations are retained, and the structure mirrors the source closely.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and fluently, with only minor stylistic choices (formal pronoun, regional lexical item) that could be refined for a more uniform conversational tone. The translation is fully understandable, technically sound, and faithful to the source material.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 18, Fluency 17, Terminology 19, Contextual Adaptation 18, Information Completeness 20. Total: 92/100.\n\nThe translation would benefit from a consistent informal register (using \"tú\") and a more universally understood term for \"bachotaje\", but these are small issues in an otherwise excellent rendering.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 92"
