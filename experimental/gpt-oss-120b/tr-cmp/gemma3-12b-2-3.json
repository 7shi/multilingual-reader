  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear order. Most sentences are easy to understand, and complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia and aprendizaje en contexto are explained with simple analogies. A few very long sentences could be split for better clarity, but overall a Spanish‑speaking reader can follow the discussion without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural, using familiar colloquial forms like “¡Exactamente!” and “imaginad”. However, there are some awkward constructions (e.g., “aprendizaje basado en el contexto, conocido como ICL (In‑Context Learning)”, “aprendizaje con contexto e instrucciones”) and an unnecessary editorial note about grounding options that breaks the flow. These issues lower the overall smoothness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, grounding, etc. The translator kept the English acronyms and gave appropriate Spanish equivalents. Minor inconsistencies appear (e.g., “aprendizaje con contexto e instrucciones” instead of a direct translation of ICL) but they do not cause misunderstanding.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The tone matches the original podcast style, preserving the informal, conversational vibe. Cultural adaptation is adequate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The presence of the translator’s internal comment about three grounding options is out of place and detracts from the adaptation quality.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the analogies are retained. The extra note on grounding options is superfluous but does not remove any essential information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is faithful and largely clear, conveying the original podcast’s educational tone. It succeeds in making the technical content accessible, though a few awkward phrasings and an unnecessary editorial remark prevent it from being completely polished. Minor edits would bring it to a near‑native level of fluency and consistency.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
