  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can grasp. Minor hiccups such as the odd phrase “montas en silla” slightly disrupt the flow, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and the dialogue flows smoothly. A few constructions feel a little forced (“montas en silla”, “el afinamiento” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”), yet they are understandable and do not break native‑speaker expectations.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly transferred: pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, etc. Consistency is maintained throughout. The choice of “afinamiento” for fine‑tuning is acceptable, though “ajuste fino” would be more idiomatic.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the target audience’s linguistic and cultural context. The explanatory style is kept, and no French‑specific idioms leak through. The only notable mis‑step is the unnatural “montas en silla”, which feels out of place in Spanish.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is preserved. No ideas are omitted, and no extraneous material is added. The translation remains faithful to the source content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the original podcast script accurately, maintains the technical depth, and reads smoothly for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor lexical choices and a couple of awkward phrases prevent a perfect score, but they do not significantly affect the listener’s understanding.\nTotal score (out of 100): 90/100.\nStrengths: clarity, faithful rendering of technical concepts, consistent terminology. Areas for improvement: prefer more common technical equivalents (e.g., “ajuste fino”) and refine a few awkward expressions to enhance naturalness.\nScore: 90/100."
