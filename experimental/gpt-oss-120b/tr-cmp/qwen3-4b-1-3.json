    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and the dialogue structure is preserved. Most sentences are clear, and the technical ideas are explained in a way that a non‑expert can grasp. However, occasional typographical errors (e.g., “conocencias” instead of “conocimientos”) and the singular “bienvenido” may cause a slight hiccup for the reader.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural constructions and inconsistencies in register (mix of \"tú\" and \"usted\"), as well as odd word choices such as “prueba de fuego” for “antisèche”. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., “a nuevo” instead of “de nuevo”) also break the flow. Despite these issues, the text is largely understandable.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly handled correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”, and “fine‑tuning” are all present and appropriate. The main problem is the occasional typo (“conocencias”) and gender disagreement (“las nuevas conocimientos”). Overall the terminology is consistent and suitable for the target audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone, and adapts the content for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Some cultural/linguistic nuances are missed – the singular “bienvenido” sounds less inclusive, and the mistranslation of “antisèche” as “prueba de fuego” changes the meaning. The shift between formal and informal pronouns also reduces coherence.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are retained; no substantive information is omitted. Minor nuances (e.g., the exact nature of a “cheat‑sheet”) are slightly altered, but the overall message remains intact. Redundancy is not an issue.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content of the podcast and keeps the dialogue format intact. It is readable and mostly accurate, but it suffers from several fluency problems, occasional typographical errors, and a few mistranslations that affect naturalness and precise meaning. With a careful editorial pass to fix gender agreement, pronoun consistency, and the \"antisèche\" translation, the text would reach a higher level of polish.\nOverall rating: 16/20."
