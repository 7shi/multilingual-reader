  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is fragmented and contains many incomplete sentences (e.g., \"Luc: desenmascarar\", \"Luc: the difference between temporary knowledge and a permanent skill.\"). Several ideas from the original are lost or garbled, making it difficult for a Spanish‑speaking reader to follow the dialogue. The logical flow of the conversation is broken, so comprehension suffers.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are numerous un‑natural constructions, abrupt line breaks, and English fragments left in the translation. Phrases such as \"listillo/a,\" \";translati\" and missing verbs show that the text does not read smoothly to a native speaker. Vocabulary choices are sometimes appropriate, but the overall fluency is very low.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL) are mostly preserved, which is good. However, some terms are omitted (e.g., \"grounding\"/\"anclaje\" is only hinted at) and others appear inconsistent or are left in English. The handling of terminology is uneven.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to keep the podcast tone, but many cultural or contextual cues are lost because whole sentences are missing or truncated. The adaptation does not fully convey the original intent, especially in sections where the speakers explain analogies or the concept of memory.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A significant portion of the original dialogue is absent or incompletely rendered. Examples include missing parts of Luc's explanations, incomplete sentences, and placeholder text. Important explanatory details are omitted, reducing completeness.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is far from satisfactory. While some technical vocabulary is correctly transferred, the text suffers from severe omissions, broken sentences, and leftover English fragments that cripple readability, fluency, and completeness. Substantial revision is required to produce a coherent, natural‑sounding Spanish version that faithfully represents the original French podcast script.\n\n**Overall score (average of criteria): 5 / 20**"
