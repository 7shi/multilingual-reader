  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is interleaved with translation‑style comments, English sentences and meta‑remarks (e.g., \"The improved translation could be …\", \"Alternatively, a more natural translation could be …\"). This makes the flow chaotic and forces the reader to constantly switch between the intended dialogue and the translator’s notes. Sentence structures are often broken, and the dialogue itself is hard to follow, resulting in very poor comprehension for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Because of the mixed language, literal renderings, and awkward phrasing (e.g., \"Por lo tanto, después del pre‑entrenamiento, la IA es como un joven graduado universitario\", \"Olvidará todo, lo que significa que su memoria es temporal\"), the translation does not read as natural Spanish. Several expressions are literal translations of French idioms that sound odd in Spanish, and the presence of English fragments further disrupts fluency.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are generally correct, but their usage is inconsistent (sometimes \"pre‑entrenamiento\", sometimes \"preentrenamiento\"). Moreover, the translator adds explanatory parentheses that are unnecessary for the target audience, and occasionally substitutes terms with less common equivalents (e.g., \"el afinamiento\" instead of the standard \"fine‑tuning\"). Overall, terminology handling is adequate but not consistent.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original podcast tone (conversational, informal) is lost amid the prescriptive translation notes. Cultural adaptation is minimal; instead of delivering a smooth Spanish dialogue, the text presents a meta‑discussion about translation choices, which is irrelevant for the intended listeners. Consequently, the intent and purpose of the original are poorly conveyed.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "While most of the original content is present, many sentences are replaced or heavily altered by the translator’s commentary, causing omissions (e.g., some nuances about \"grounding\" are reduced to a single sentence) and redundancies (repeating the same explanatory note in several forms). The final product does not deliver a clean, complete version of the original script.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The submission is not a finished translation but a collection of translation notes, alternatives, and occasional English fragments. As a result, readability, fluency, and overall coherence suffer dramatically. Technical terminology is mostly correct but inconsistently applied, and the conversational tone of the original podcast is lost. To be usable, the text would need to be rewritten as a single, clean Spanish script, removing all meta‑comments, choosing consistent terminology, and adapting idiomatic expressions to natural Spanish.\n\n**Overall score (average of the five criteria):** 5.6/20."
