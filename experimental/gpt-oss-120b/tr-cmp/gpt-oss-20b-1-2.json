  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the sentences are logically ordered. Complex ideas such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto are explained clearly. Minor issues such as occasional formal‑informal inconsistency (e.g., “Usted ha entendido todo” vs. the rest of the text in informal tone) and the hyphenated “pre‑entrenamiento” slightly affect flow, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but a few phrases are literal or awkward for a native speaker: “Usted ha entendido todo”, “una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”, and the occasional switch between “tú” and “usted”. Vocabulary choices are appropriate, yet the small clunky constructions prevent a perfect native‑like fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly and consistently. Terms like \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" y \"anclaje\" are translated with the accepted Spanish equivalents. The only minor point is the mixed use of \"pre‑entrenamiento\" versus \"preentrenamiento\", but this does not affect understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral and the analogy of a \"consultor brillante\" works well in Spanish. The shift in formality (occasionally using \"Usted\") is the only slight mismatch with the overall informal podcast voice.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas or details are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue faithfully. Redundancies are minimal and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the technical concepts clearly. It maintains most of the original’s educational tone and includes all necessary information. Minor fluency glitches and occasional inconsistency in register keep it from being perfect, but overall it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI topics.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17.4 ≈ 17/20."
