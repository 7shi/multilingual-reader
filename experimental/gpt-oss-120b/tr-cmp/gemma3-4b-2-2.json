  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text contains numerous stray characters (e.g., “}”, “4.”) and truncated sentences that interrupt the flow. Some sentences are incomplete or abruptly end, making it hard for a reader to follow the argument. The redundant greeting at the start also adds confusion. These issues significantly reduce comprehensibility.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many expressions sound unnatural or overly literal (“¡Bienvenidos! Y bienvenido”, “ventana contextual”, “el modelo en sí no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus conversaciones”). The presence of formatting artifacts and broken punctuation further disrupts the naturalness. Native speakers would find the text awkward.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje contextual (ICL)\" and \"grounding\" are mostly rendered correctly. However, some terms are inconsistently translated (e.g., \"ventana contextual\" instead of the more common \"ventana de contexto\") and a few key concepts from the original are omitted or garbled.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to keep the podcast tone but fails due to the numerous errors and the occasional mix‑up of the podcast name (originally \"Tech Éclair\", translated as \"TecnoLuz\" then reverted to \"Tech Éclair\"). Cultural references are fine, but the broken sentences and leftover symbols hinder the intended impact.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several portions of the original dialogue are missing or cut off, especially the detailed explanation of memory vs. fine‑tuning and the concluding remarks. Additionally, stray symbols obscure meaning, leading to loss of information.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation suffers from serious mechanical and editorial problems. While most technical vocabulary is recognizable, the pervasive formatting errors, truncated sentences, and inconsistent naming make the text difficult to read and understand. A thorough revision is required to restore fluency, completeness, and overall quality.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 8/20."
