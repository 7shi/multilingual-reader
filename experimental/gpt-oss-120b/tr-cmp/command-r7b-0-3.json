  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall easy to follow. Sentences are clear and the dialogue format is preserved, allowing readers to understand the concepts without difficulty. Minor issues such as occasional overly long sentences and occasional missing punctuation do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural, but there are several awkward or unidiomatic phrases (e.g., \"Aprendizaje en Contexto Interno\", \"ancoraje\", the excessive use of exclamation marks, and the typo \"model en só mismo\"). These hiccups prevent the text from flowing as smoothly as a native‑speaker version would.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"memoria\". The abbreviation ICL is mistranslated as \"Aprendizaje en Contexto Interno\" instead of simply \"aprendizaje en contexto\", and \"grounding\" is rendered as \"ancoraje\" which, while understandable, is less common than \"anclaje\". Consistency is good overall.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the informal, conversational tone of the podcast and adapts cultural references appropriately. However, some stylistic choices (excessive exclamation marks) feel out of place for a professional podcast script, and typographical errors like \"só mismo\" detract from the professionalism.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French original are present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the explanations remain faithful to the source. Minor redundancies appear but do not affect the overall completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original message and technical content accurately, but its fluency and stylistic polish need improvement. Terminology is mostly correct, though a few terms could be rendered more idiomatically. Minor typographical errors and an over‑use of exclamation marks make the text feel less polished than the source. Overall, it is a solid functional translation that would benefit from a careful proofreading and slight adjustment of idiomatic expressions.\nScore out of 100 (sum of the five criteria): 80/100."
