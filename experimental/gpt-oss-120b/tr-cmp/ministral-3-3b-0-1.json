    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas are conveyed in a logical order. Most sentences are easy to follow, but a few constructions are overly long or redundant (e.g., “aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (aprendizaje en contexto dentro del contexto)”). Minor typographical errors such as “informaciónes” slightly affect readability.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, but there are several awkward or non‑idiomatic expressions: “el afinado” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”, the redundant parenthetical definition of ICL, and the mixed use of English terms like “crunchar”. These issues prevent the text from sounding completely native.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, grounding → anclaje). However, the choice of “afinado” for fine‑tuning is less standard, and the ICL explanation is confusing. The term “crunchar” is left untranslated, which may puzzle some readers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The tone of a podcast conversation is well preserved and the cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor issues (redundant phrasing, occasional literal translations) slightly reduce the adaptation quality.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original script is present; no significant content is omitted. The translation even adds a clarifying parenthetical for ICL, albeit a bit confusing. Overall the message is complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. It would benefit from polishing awkward phrasing, correcting a few typographical errors, and using more conventional Spanish terminology for fine‑tuning and ICL. With these refinements, the text would be fully natural and fluent for native readers.\n\nStrengths: faithful content, clear structure, appropriate tone.\nWeaknesses: occasional non‑idiomatic wording, minor typos, inconsistent technical term choices.\n\nThe translation is good enough for a knowledgeable audience but still needs a light edit for native‑speaker polish.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 16/20."
