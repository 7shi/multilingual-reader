  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original flow, but several typographical errors (e.g., “afinomamiento”, “crammar”, “increñablemente”) and awkward phrasing interrupt smooth reading. The sentence structure is mostly logical, yet occasional literal translations make the discourse feel stiff.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are many unnatural expressions: the use of “bachillerato” for “cramming”, the parenthetical English note left in the translation, and odd word choices such as “perfila”. These issues make the translation sound non‑native despite being mostly correct grammatically.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto) are correctly rendered, but some terms are misspelled or inconsistent (e.g., “ancoraje” instead of “anclaje”). Overall the terminology is adequate but not flawless.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original podcast tone, but cultural and linguistic nuances are sometimes missed (e.g., the cramming analogy, inclusion of English meta‑comments). The adaptation is acceptable but could be smoother for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present; no substantive information is omitted. Minor errors do not affect the conveyed meaning, and the translation remains faithful to the source content.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core ideas of the original French podcast and includes the essential technical concepts. However, it suffers from several typographical mistakes, unnatural phrasing, and occasional mistranslations that reduce readability and fluency. Technical terminology is mostly accurate, but consistency could be improved. Overall, the text is functional but would benefit from careful proofreading and stylistic polishing to reach native‑speaker quality.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 13/20."
