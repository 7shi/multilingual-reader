  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor hiccups such as the literal rendering of «el afinado» instead of the more common «el ajuste fino» do not impede comprehension, but they slightly affect smoothness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several instances of awkward or inconsistent language: the shift between formal \"Usted\" and informal \"tú\", the use of \"Usted ha entendido todo\" instead of a more natural \"¡Has entendido todo!\", and occasional punctuation issues (e.g., extra spaces before exclamation marks). These make the translation feel less natural for native speakers, though the meaning is preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje (grounding) and ventana de contexto are correctly translated and consistently used. The only minor point is the choice of «afinado» for fine‑tuning, where «ajuste fino» would be more idiomatic, but the meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone of a podcast discussion. Cultural adaptation is mostly appropriate, though the opening \"Buenos días\" may feel overly specific for a recorded podcast, and the mixed register (formal vs. informal) slightly detracts from a consistent voice. Overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is retained. No significant omissions or additions are observed, and the technical explanations remain intact. The translation is complete and faithful to the original content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and comprehensive, preserving the technical depth of the original French script. However, occasional unnatural phrasing, mixed registers, and a few less idiomatic term choices affect fluency. With minor revisions to smooth out these issues, the text would read like a natural Spanish podcast transcript.\nOverall score: 86/100 (out of a possible 100)."
