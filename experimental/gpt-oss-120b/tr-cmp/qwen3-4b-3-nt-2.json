  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are conveyed clearly. Most sentences are logical, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. Minor hiccups such as “¡Hola y bienvenido en…” and occasional mismatched pronouns slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural to a native speaker: the use of \"usted\" versus \"tú\", the literal translation of \"Usted ha entendido todo\", the verb error \"cuando usted afinan un modelo\", and the preposition error in the opening greeting. These issues break the natural flow, even though the overall meaning is preserved.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\" and \"anclaje\" are correctly rendered and used consistently. The word \"prompt\" is left untranslated, which is acceptable in a technical context. Only a tiny inconsistency appears with \"memoria a corto plazo\" instead of \"memoria a corto plazo\" (minor).",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the original podcast tone and purpose. It adapts the content for Spanish‑speaking listeners, though the register fluctuates between formal \"usted\" and informal \"tú\", and the opening greeting could be smoother. Overall, the intent and persuasive style are preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No relevant details are omitted, and no extra, unnecessary content is added. The translation faithfully reproduces the dialogue and examples.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of conveying the original discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning. Technical terminology is accurate and consistent, and the full content is retained. However, fluency suffers from several unnatural phrasings, inconsistent pronoun use, and minor grammatical errors, which prevent it from feeling completely native. Improving these stylistic points would raise the overall quality substantially.\nOverall score (out of 100): 83/100."
