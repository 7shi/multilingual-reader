  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the podcast‑style dialogue is preserved, allowing the reader to understand complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning. A few minor hiccups (e.g., occasional long sentences, slight redundancy) prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are inconsistencies in register (mix of \"Usted\" and \"tú\"), and some literal renderings that feel slightly awkward (e.g., \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\", \"el modelo en sí mismo\"). Vocabulary is appropriate, yet the switch of formality detracts from fluidity.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\", \"anclaje\" for grounding, etc. The occasional retention of English words like \"prompt\" is acceptable in a tech‑focused audience, and term usage is consistent throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural references are neutral, which works for a broad Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor issues arise from mixed levels of formality, but overall the adaptation preserves the podcast’s conversational feel.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French source is present. No major ideas are omitted, and the logical flow of the discussion is retained. Supplementary explanations are faithful to the original, and no redundant or superfluous content was introduced.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. Readability and terminology are strong points, while fluency suffers slightly due to inconsistent register and a few literal constructions. Contextual adaptation is good, and the translation is complete with no loss of information. With minor polishing—especially harmonising the formality and smoothing a few awkward phrases—the text would read as a fully native‑like podcast script.\nOverall score: 86/100."
