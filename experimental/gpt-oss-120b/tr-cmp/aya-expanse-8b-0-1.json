  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand. Sentences follow a logical order and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor issues such as occasional missing opening exclamation marks and a few overly formal pronouns (e.g., “Usted”) slightly hinder smooth comprehension, but they do not prevent the reader from following the discussion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward spots: the use of “Usted” in a conversational podcast is unnatural, some punctuation (¡) is missing, and the final brand name changes from “Tech Éclair” to “Tech Flash”, which feels like a slip rather than a deliberate localization. These quirks lower the overall fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and “anclaje” are all appropriate and consistent. No major mistranslations of jargon are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone of a friendly tech podcast. Cultural references are kept neutral, which is suitable. The only notable mismatch is the change of the podcast name to “Tech Flash” at the end, which alters the brand identity and therefore reduces the adaptation score slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The only minor loss is the missing opening exclamation mark in a few places, which does not affect the factual content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. The handling of terminology is strong, and the content is complete. Fluency and readability are slightly marred by formal pronoun choice, occasional punctuation errors, and an inconsistent rendering of the podcast’s name at the conclusion. With minor polishing, the text would read as a natural, engaging Spanish podcast script.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
