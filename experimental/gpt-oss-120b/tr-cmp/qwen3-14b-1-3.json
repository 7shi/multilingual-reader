  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow. Sentences are clear and the flow of the dialogue mirrors the original. A few minor issues (e.g., missing article before “preentrenamiento” and occasional long sentences) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most of the script. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic, though there are a couple of slightly awkward phrasings such as “bacotaje” (a literal borrowing of French slang) and the capitalised “Memoria”. Overall, a native speaker would find it smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento (fine‑tuning)”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”. The term “grounding” is left in English, which is acceptable for a tech‑savvy audience but could have been glossed. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately. The dialogue style remains informal and engaging for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience. Minor literal translations (e.g., “bacotaje”) could be refined, but they do not distort meaning.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present. No key points are omitted, and the structure of the conversation is preserved. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content clearly, maintains the conversational tone, and stays faithful to the source. Small lexical choices (like “bacotaje” and leaving “grounding” untranslated) are the only notable blemishes, but they do not impede understanding. The work would be well received by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 18, Fluency 17, Terminology 18, Contextual Adaptation 16, Information Completeness 19. Total: 88/100.\n\nThe translation demonstrates solid command of both languages and a good grasp of the subject matter, with only minor areas for polishing to reach near‑perfect fluency and cultural nuance.\n\n**Total score (out of 100): 88**"
