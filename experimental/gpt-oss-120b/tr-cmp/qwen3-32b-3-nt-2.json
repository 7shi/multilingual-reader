    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are clear and the logical flow mirrors the original. A few long sentences and the occasional redundant phrasing (e.g., \"aprendizaje en contexto, o Aprendizaje en Contexto\") slightly hinder smooth reading, but the overall comprehension is very good.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, using appropriate Spanish vocabulary and syntax. Minor awkwardness appears in phrases like \"ampliación significativa de la memoria de corto plazo\" (better: \"ampliación significativa de la ventana de contexto\") and the mixed use of French-style guillemets « ». These issues prevent a perfect native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". Consistency is maintained throughout, and where a term could be unfamiliar (e.g., \"grounding\"), a Spanish equivalent is provided. No major mistranslations.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast tone and intent, adapting cultural references appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The use of familiar analogies (consultor, estudiante, bicicleta) works well. Minor punctuation choices (guillemets) are a stylistic carry‑over but do not affect the message.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas, examples, and nuances from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted or added unnecessarily. The translation is faithful and concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content clearly and retains the conversational, educational style of the original podcast. Minor stylistic and fluency issues (some redundant phrasing and slightly clunky constructions) keep the score just below perfect, but the translation would be easily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners and faithfully reflects the source material."
