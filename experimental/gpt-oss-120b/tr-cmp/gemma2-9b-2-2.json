    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original. Most sentences are easy to understand, and the technical concepts are explained in simple terms. Minor hiccups (e.g., “Imagínese que se le da a una nueva IA en la escuela”) slightly reduce smoothness, but the overall comprehensibility is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in many places, but there are several awkward constructions and literal renderings that a native speaker would avoid. Examples include the literal use of “anclage”, the phrase “se le da a una nueva IA en la escuela”, and the redundant “hasta la próxima para el próximo episodio”. These issues lower the fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well‑handled (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto). However, the word “afianzamiento” is not the usual translation for «affinage» and can confuse readers, and the French term “ancrage” is left untranslated. This inconsistency hurts the terminology score.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator kept the original intent and tone, and adapted the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are appropriate. The main drawback is the occasional retention of French words and a few phrases that feel translated rather than localized.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas or examples are omitted, and the translation does not add irrelevant material. The content is complete and faithful to the source.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and preserves the educational tone. Readability and completeness are strong points, but fluency and terminology suffer from some literal translations and non‑standard word choices (e.g., “afianzamiento”, retaining “ancrage”). A native‑speaker revision focusing on idiomatic phrasing and consistent technical vocabulary would raise the overall quality significantly.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15.2 → rounded to 15 out of 20.\n\n**Final score:** 15/20"
