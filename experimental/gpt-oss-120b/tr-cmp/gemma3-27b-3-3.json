  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand and follows a logical flow. Most sentences are clear, and complex ideas are explained in a way that a non‑expert can follow. Minor issues affect readability: an unnecessary greeting “Hola y bienvenida” adds redundancy, and the duplicated “Luc: Luc:” line can cause brief confusion. The term “optimización” is used for fine‑tuning, which is understandable but less precise.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, using appropriate colloquial Spanish. There are a few awkward constructions (e.g., “inserta automáticamente estos extractos en el prompt, de forma automática” repeats ‘automáticamente’, and the duplication of speaker tags). Some word choices such as “ineficaz” are acceptable but slightly less idiomatic than “ineficiente”. Overall, the flow is smooth with only minor hiccups.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely preserved: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “ventana de contexto”, “grounding”. The main inconsistency is translating “fine‑tuning” as “optimización”; a more accurate term would be “ajuste fino” or “afinamiento”. Apart from that, terminology is consistent and appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the conversational podcast tone and adapts cultural references appropriately. The extra greeting and the duplicated speaker label are minor lapses, but they do not alter the overall intent. The adaptation successfully conveys the original’s explanatory and informal style.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present: pre‑training, transfer learning, fine‑tuning vs. in‑context learning, grounding, temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the description of “memory” features. No substantive information is omitted, though the duplicated line and a small redundancy slightly affect conciseness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the original content well, with clear explanations of technical concepts. Minor errors—such as a duplicated speaker tag, a redundant greeting, and the sub‑optimal translation of ‘fine‑tuning’—prevent it from being flawless, but they do not hinder comprehension. Overall, it is a solid, high‑quality translation suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners of the podcast.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 82/100."
