  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The document mixes the final translation with numerous alternative phrasings, bracketed notes, and meta‑comments. A reader looking for a coherent Spanish version of the podcast must filter out the options, which interrupts the flow and makes the text hard to follow. The underlying ideas are understandable, but the presentation greatly reduces readability.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many of the suggested sentences are idiomatic and sound natural (e.g., \"una IA que parece recordar\", \"aprendizaje contextual\"), but the overall piece lacks a smooth, continuous narrative because the alternatives are interleaved. The frequent switches between formal, casual, and technical registers also create inconsistency, lowering overall fluency.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is generally well‑handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por contexto (ICL)\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"matriz de pesos\", etc., are used correctly and consistently in most places. Some minor variations (e.g., \"transferencia de aprendizaje\" vs. \"transferencia de conocimiento\") are acceptable, but the abundance of synonyms can be confusing.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and provides culturally appropriate analogies (e.g., the bicycle, the consultant). However, the presence of many optional formulations and explanatory side‑bars makes it less tailored to a single target audience. The core message is preserved, but the adaptation is diluted by the format.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the notion of temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the emerging memory features. In fact, the translation goes beyond the source by adding explanatory notes, so no essential information is lost.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The submission provides a very thorough set of translation options and linguistic commentary, which demonstrates deep understanding of the material and excellent handling of technical vocabulary. However, as a final translation it is unsuitable because it is a collage of alternatives rather than a single, polished Spanish version. Readability and fluency suffer from the fragmented structure, and the multiplicity of registers creates inconsistency. For a production‑ready podcast script, the content would need to be distilled into one coherent narrative while preserving the strong terminology choices already made.\nOverall score (out of 100): 62/100."
