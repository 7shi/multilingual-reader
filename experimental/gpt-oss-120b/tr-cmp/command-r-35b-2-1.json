  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original logical flow, but there are several awkward constructions and unnecessary editorial remarks (e.g., “O bien:” and the note about the word “propuesta”) that interrupt the reading experience. Some sentences are overly long or redundant, which slightly hampers smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many expressions that sound unnatural to native speakers: “El aprendizaje por inserción y calibración (ICL)”, “encastrement”, and the repeated definition of pre‑entrenamiento. Verb tenses and article usage are occasionally off, making the prose feel stilted rather than conversational.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are inconsistently handled. While “aprendizaje por transferencia” and “ventana de contexto” are correct, “In‑Context Learning” is mistranslated as “aprendizaje por inserción y calibración”, and “fine‑tuning” becomes “especialización del aprendizaje” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”. The term “grounding” is rendered as “encastrement”, which is not the usual Spanish equivalent.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely preserves the original intent, but the insertion of meta‑comments about word choice (“El uso de la palabra ‘propuesta’…”) deviates from the source and may confuse listeners. Cultural adaptation is fine, yet the extra commentary reduces fidelity to the original speaker’s voice.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present, including pre‑training, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and the distinction between temporary consulting and permanent expertise. However, the mislabeling of ICL and the added editorial notes introduce slight inaccuracies, though no major factual information is lost.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core concepts of the podcast and is largely complete, but suffers from several linguistic and terminological inaccuracies. Unnecessary editorial interjections and mis‑translations of key technical terms affect both readability and naturalness. A revision focusing on consistent terminology (e.g., using \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"ajuste fino\"), removing meta‑comments, and smoothing awkward phrasing would raise the overall quality considerably.\n\nOverall score: 64/100."
