    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in simple sentences. A few minor oddities (e.g., mixing «Bonjour» with Spanish, and a slightly confusing question about “ajuste fino”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, but there are occasional awkward constructions: “¡Bonjour y bienvenido”, “¿es ahí donde se aplica el “ajuste fino”?” and the use of asterisks around *prompt*. These quirks prevent a perfect native‑like flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly well‑handled: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “transferencia de aprendizaje”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “ventana de contexto”, “anclaje a datos”. The only inconsistency is the interchangeable use of “afinamiento” and “ajuste fino”, which could confuse readers about whether they refer to the same process.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the original tone to Spanish, using appropriate idioms (e.g., “da la impresión”, “consultor temporal”). Cultural references are preserved, and the overall intent of the podcast dialogue is maintained. The occasional French word does not break the adaptation.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as the source. Minor wording changes (e.g., adding “a datos” to “anclaje”) do not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and reads smoothly for a Spanish‑speaking audience, with only a handful of minor stylistic slips and a slight inconsistency in terminology. Overall, it serves the purpose of the podcast script well and would be readily understood by listeners.\n\nStrengths: clear exposition of complex AI concepts, appropriate technical vocabulary, faithful preservation of the original dialogue’s tone. Areas for improvement: tighten a few awkward phrasings, maintain consistent terminology for fine‑tuning, and avoid mixing languages unless stylistically required.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17.4 out of 20, rounded to 17 for reporting purposes.\n\nScore: 17.4"
