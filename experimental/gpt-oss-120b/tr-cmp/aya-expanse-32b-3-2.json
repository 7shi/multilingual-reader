  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the ideas are conveyed, but there are several interruptions that hurt smooth reading. The stray markdown/code‑block fragment (\"}```json ```json {\") breaks the flow, and some sentences are overly long or redundant, making it harder for a casual reader to follow.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural, but a few phrasing choices are awkward (e.g., \"levantamos el velo\", \"el preentrenamiento, una etapa crucial\" repeated). The unexpected code‑block markup is jarring and clearly non‑native. Overall the translation is readable but not fully fluent.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". The terminology is consistent throughout the script and appropriate for a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original content to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using idiomatic expressions and appropriate register. The only drawback is the out‑of‑place code‑block artefact, which does not belong in a spoken‑style podcast script.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French version are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the discussion about memory features. No substantive information is omitted, aside from the minor formatting glitch.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of preserving the technical depth and overall structure of the original podcast script. Terminology is handled well, and the core ideas are retained. However, the presence of stray markdown/code‑block text and a few stylistic hiccups reduce readability and fluency. With minor editing to remove the artefacts and smooth some phrasing, the translation would be near‑native quality.\nOverall score: 14/20.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 13, Fluency 12, Terminology 16, Contextual Adaptation 14, Information Completeness 15.\n\nOverall rating (average): 14/20."
