  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is cluttered with parenthetical notes, alternative phrasings and justification comments (e.g., “Justificación de cambios”, “Alternativa más concisa”). These interrupt the flow of the dialogue and make it hard for a listener‑or reader‑oriented audience to follow the podcast script. Core ideas are still present, but the extra annotations lower overall comprehensibility.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Numerous sentences sound stilted or overly literal (“la IA no 'olvida' en el sentido humano; simplemente se reinicia su contexto de conversación”). The mix of formal explanatory style with occasional English terms (ICL, grounding) and the presence of translation‑process commentary create an unnatural tone for native Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, grounding, etc. There are a few inconsistencies (occasionally the French “affinage” appears) but overall the terminology is appropriate for the intended technical audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original podcast’s conversational, informal tone is lost. The translator added meta‑information that would never be spoken in a podcast, which detracts from the original intent. Cultural adaptation is minimal; instead, the text feels like a translation commentary rather than a smooth Spanish version.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present, and no essential factual information is omitted. However, the added explanatory notes sometimes obscure the original meaning, and some nuances (e.g., the playful analogies) are diluted by the overly technical re‑phrasing.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full technical content but does so in a way that is unsuitable for a podcast audience. Excessive translator commentary, awkward sentence constructions, and a mismatch of register hinder readability and naturalness. Terminology is handled well, but the overall style needs to be cleaned up to match the original’s conversational flow.\n\nRecommendations: remove all parenthetical editorial notes, simplify phrasing, keep the dialogue tone, and ensure consistent use of Spanish technical terms without unnecessary English insertions.\n\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 58/100."
