  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the podcast dialogue flows naturally. A few long sentences could be broken up, but overall the listener can understand the concepts without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural, but there are a couple of awkward choices: \"una trampa\" for \"cheat‑sheet\" sounds odd, and the phrase \"consultor temporal\" is a literal translation that, while understandable, is less idiomatic than \"consultor a corto plazo\". Minor lexical slips prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"anclaje\" etc. The translator kept the abbreviation \"IA\" and used appropriate Spanish equivalents, showing consistency and accuracy.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The tone of a podcast is preserved, the greeting is adapted (\"¡Hola y bienvenidos a 'Tecnología Relámpago'\") and cultural references are respected. Minor issues such as keeping the original French title at the very end are acceptable. Overall the intent and style are well conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No sections are omitted, and the explanatory details are retained. The translation is concise yet complete.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality, accurately conveying the technical content and podcast tone. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency suffers only from a few slightly unnatural word choices. Information is fully preserved, and the adaptation respects the target audience. The work is suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners interested in AI concepts, needing only minor polishing for maximum naturalness.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
