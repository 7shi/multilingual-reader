  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the concepts are explained clearly. Sentences are mostly short and easy to follow, making the content accessible to a broad audience. Minor hiccups (e.g., occasional long clauses) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most of the podcast, but there are a few stylistic mismatches such as the shift from informal \"has\" to formal \"Usted\", and some slightly stiff phrasing (e.g., \"Usted ha entendido todo\"). Overall, a native speaker would find it smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje, etc. The acronyms are kept, and the explanations remain faithful. No important term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone. A small inconsistency appears at the end where \"Tech Éclair\" becomes \"Tech Flash\", which slightly deviates from the brand name. Apart from that, cultural references are appropriate for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present. The only notable omission is the brand‑name change mentioned above; otherwise no content is lost or added unnecessarily.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality, conveying the technical discussion clearly and naturally. Minor stylistic inconsistencies and the brand‑name alteration prevent a perfect score, but the overall message and technical accuracy are well preserved. It would be easily understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nSuggested improvements: unify the register (choose either informal \"tú\" or formal \"usted\" consistently), smooth a few stiff phrases, and keep the original podcast name throughout.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17.6/20."
