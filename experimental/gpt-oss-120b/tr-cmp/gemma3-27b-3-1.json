  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable; sentences follow a logical order and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor issues such as a duplicated speaker tag (\"Luc: Luc:\") and occasional clunky phrasing slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several unnatural expressions (e.g., \"optimización\" for fine‑tuning, \"es del bachotaje\", \"Luc: Luc:\"), occasional literal translations, and occasional English words left in the text. Despite these, a native reader can follow the conversation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly correct: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\". However, \"optimización\" is a poor translation for \"fine‑tuning\" (\"afinamiento\" would be preferred) and the term \"grounding\" is left untranslated, reducing consistency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and adapts cultural references (e.g., using \"consultor\"). Small mismatches like \"bachotaje\" and the duplicated speaker tag slightly affect the naturalness, but overall the message is preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All substantive content from the original script is present; no important ideas are omitted. Minor redundancies (duplicate tags) do not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and retains the educational tone. Readability and completeness are good, but fluency suffers from several awkward phrasings and inconsistent terminology (especially the translation of \"fine‑tuning\"). A revision focusing on natural Spanish phrasing and consistent technical vocabulary would raise the quality substantially.\nOverall rating: 15/20."
