    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the flow of the dialogue is preserved. However, there are a few redundant or overly literal constructions (e.g., “El proceso de aprendizaje se inicia con lo que denominamos el ‘pre‑entrenamiento’”) and an editorial comment about word choice that slightly disrupts the narrative.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural to a native speaker: “Aprendizaje por Inserción y Calibración (ICL)” is not a recognized term, the mix of French “encastrement” inside the Spanish, and occasional awkward phrasing such as “el modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus discusiones”. These issues reduce the smoothness of the translation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical concepts are mostly rendered correctly – “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “afinamiento” (as “refinamiento”) – but the key acronym ICL is mistranslated, and “fine‑tuning” is rendered as “especialización del aprendizaje”, which is less precise. The inconsistent use of French terms also harms terminology consistency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent and educational tone are retained, and cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only drawback is the inclusion of the meta‑comment about the word “propuesta”, which is unnecessary and slightly shifts the focus.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the major ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the “memory” feature. No substantive content is lost, though a few minor nuances (e.g., the exact term “fine‑tuning”) are paraphrased.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the technical discussion accurately and is largely readable. The main issues are the incorrect rendering of the ICL acronym, occasional unnatural phrasing, and the presence of French terms and editorial notes that could be removed for a cleaner Spanish version. With minor revisions the text would be fluent, terminologically precise, and perfectly adapted to a Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 15.2 / 20."
