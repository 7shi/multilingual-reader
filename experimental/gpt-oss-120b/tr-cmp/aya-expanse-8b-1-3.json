  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences are clear, and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. Minor hiccups – such as the inconsistent podcast name change from \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Tech Luz\" and a few overly formal turns like \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\" – slightly affect flow, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural for a spoken podcast, but there are occasional awkward phrasings that feel more written than spoken (e.g., \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\", \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje contextualizado automatizado\"). The inconsistent renaming of the show and occasional literal renderings make the text feel a bit stilted in places. Overall, a native speaker would understand it without trouble, but a smoother, more conversational style would be preferable.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", and \"anclaje\" are correctly translated and consistently used. The English acronyms (ICL) are retained, which is appropriate for the audience. No major mistranslations of technical concepts were detected.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience adequately: greetings, polite forms, and explanations are appropriate. The main drawback is the inconsistent naming of the podcast (\"Tech Éclair\" → \"Tech Luz\"), which could confuse listeners familiar with the original brand. Aside from that, cultural references and the overall tone are fitting.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French script is present. No significant ideas or details are omitted, and the translation does not add irrelevant material. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., \"es increíblemente adaptable\" vs. \"es increíblemente flexible\") do not affect the factual content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and retains most of its educational value. It handles technical terminology competently and presents the material in a comprehensible way. The main issues are a few unnaturally formal expressions and the inconsistent renaming of the podcast, which slightly detract from fluency and contextual adaptation. Overall, it is a solid translation that would be well understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners, though a bit more polishing would improve its naturalness for an audio format.\n\nOverall Score (average of the five criteria): 16.6 → 17/20"
