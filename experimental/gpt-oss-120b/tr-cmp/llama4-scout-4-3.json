  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text mixes the actual Spanish translation with numerous meta‑comments, alternative phrasings and English placeholders (e.g., “The improved translation could be …”, “Or, for a more polished version”). This interleaving breaks the flow and makes it hard for a Spanish‑speaking reader to follow the dialogue. Sentence structures are often long and occasionally redundant, further reducing comprehension.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "When the pure Spanish sentences are considered, they are generally understandable, but many expressions are awkward (e.g., “Olvidará todo, lo que significa que su memoria es temporal”, “la IA no ha 'olvidado' en el sentido estricto del término”). The presence of English fragments and the repeated suggestion blocks make the whole passage feel un‑polished and unnatural for a native speaker.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL” and “grounding” are mostly retained, which is good. However, the translation is inconsistent (sometimes “afinamiento”, sometimes “ajuste fino”) and some English terms are left untranslated (e.g., “fine‑tuning”, “prompt”). No systematic glossary or explanatory footnotes are provided, which would help a non‑expert audience.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator makes an effort to adapt idioms (e.g., using «consultor» instead of «consultant») and to render French discourse markers in Spanish. Nevertheless, the constant insertion of editorial suggestions (“Una versión más pulida podría ser…”) distracts from the intended conversational tone and weakens the cultural adaptation. The core intent is preserved, but the execution is cluttered.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the main ideas from the original French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the “memory” feature. No major factual information is lost. The extra commentary does not delete content but adds noise, so completeness is high but not perfectly concise.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the full technical content of the original podcast, but it is delivered as a raw draft littered with editorial notes, alternative phrasings, and occasional English remnants. This makes the text difficult to read and less natural for Spanish listeners. Terminology is generally correct but inconsistently applied. A clean, polished version that removes the meta‑comments, standardises technical vocabulary, and smooths awkward phrasing would raise the scores dramatically across all criteria."
