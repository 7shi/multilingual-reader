    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the complex ideas about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can grasp. There are a few slightly long sentences, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural to native speakers. Most idiomatic expressions are well‑rendered (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", \"una habilidad está arraigada\"). Minor awkwardness appears in phrases like \"una gran cantidad masiva\" (redundant) and the literal rendering of \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\", which is understandable but not the most common term. Overall fluency is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled appropriately. \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and the acronym ICL are correctly kept. \"Fine‑tuning\" is rendered as \"afinación\", which is acceptable though \"ajuste fino\" would be more common. The translation maintains consistent terminology throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience without losing the original intent. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogy of a consultant is well‑translated. The tone remains conversational and fits a podcast format. No cultural mismatches are observed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present. No sentences or key ideas are omitted, and the logical flow is preserved. Minor redundancy (e.g., repeated explanations of temporary vs. permanent knowledge) mirrors the source but does not affect completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical concepts accurately, remains readable and largely natural, and respects the original podcast tone. Minor literal choices and a redundant adjective slightly reduce fluency, but they do not impair understanding. Overall, it is a solid, professional translation suitable for a Spanish‑language audience interested in AI topics.\n\nScore out of 20: 18"
