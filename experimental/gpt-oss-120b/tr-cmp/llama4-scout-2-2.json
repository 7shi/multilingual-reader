  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand and follows a logical flow. The dialogue format is preserved and the explanations of concepts are clear. Minor issues affect readability: a mixed use of \"tú\" and the formal \"usted\" creates inconsistency, and the parenthetical note about alternative terminology (added by the translator) is unnecessary for a podcast script and slightly distracts the reader.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward or literal renderings. Phrases such as \"Imaginad que enviamos una IA totalmente nueva a aprender los conceptos básicos\" and \"El afinamiento\" (instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\") feel slightly stiff. The switch to \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\" breaks the informal tone set earlier. Overall, fluency is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly translated. \"Pre‑entrenamiento\", \"In‑Context Learning (ICL)\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"grounding\" (as \"anclaje\") are appropriate. The choice of \"afinamiento\" for \"fine‑tuning\" is understandable but less idiomatic than \"ajuste fino\". The extra explanatory note about \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" is helpful but not part of the original script.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast style to Spanish speakers (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenidos\"). Cultural references are maintained and the intent of the original is fully conveyed. The occasional register shift (formal vs. informal) and the inserted meta‑comment about terminology slightly reduce the smooth cultural adaptation, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No relevant content is omitted, and the added parenthetical note does not remove any original meaning. The translation is complete.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content and the conversational tone of the original podcast. It is readable and largely faithful, with minor inconsistencies in register and a few non‑idiomatic term choices that prevent it from being completely natural. The added explanatory note, while informative, is unnecessary for a spoken script. Overall, the work is good and would be well understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience, though a final polishing pass could improve consistency and fluency.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
