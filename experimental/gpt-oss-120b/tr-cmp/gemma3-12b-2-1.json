  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained clearly. A few sentences are a bit long, and the use of \"imaginad\" may feel regional, but the overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most of the script, but there are some awkward constructions: \"aprendizaje con contexto e instrucciones\" (an unclear rendering of ICL), \"se lo olvida todo\" (should be \"lo olvida todo\"), and occasional redundancy. Vocabulary is appropriate, yet a handful of phrasing choices feel slightly forced.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled accurately: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"grounding (anclaje)\". The terms are used consistently throughout the dialogue, and the translator correctly kept English acronyms where needed. No major mistranslations of technical concepts were found.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and didactic style. Cultural references are minimal, and the few choices (e.g., \"imaginad\") are acceptable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The extra meta‑comment about translation options was left in the text, which is out‑of‑place, but otherwise the adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the original information is present; no substantive content has been omitted. The only drawback is the inclusion of the translator’s explanatory note inside the dialogue (the three‑option paragraph about \"grounding\"), which adds unnecessary material and slightly distracts from the original flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the technical content accurately and is mostly readable and natural for Spanish speakers. Minor fluency hiccups and the stray translator note prevent it from being flawless, but the core ideas, examples, and analogies are preserved effectively. With a small editorial pass to clean up the extraneous comment and smooth a few awkward phrases, the translation would reach a near‑perfect level.\n\n**Final average score:** (17 + 15 + 18 + 18 + 16) / 5 = **16.8 / 20**"
