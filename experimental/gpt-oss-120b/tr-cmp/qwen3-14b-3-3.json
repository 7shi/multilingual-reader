    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version presents the same logical flow as the original French script. Sentences are generally clear and the concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can follow. A few very long sentences could be split for easier oral comprehension, but overall the text is easily understandable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, using appropriate Spanish constructions and vocabulary. Minor awkwardness appears in phrases such as \"su espacio de trabajo temporal simplemente ha sido reseteado\" (\"reseteado\" is a loan‑verb that feels informal) and the retention of English \"cheat sheet\" inside the Spanish sentence. The use of French‑style guillemets « » is acceptable in Spanish publishing, but the occasional over‑literal rendering makes the flow slightly less smooth than a native‑crafted script.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". The translator keeps the original English abbreviations (ICL) and provides Spanish equivalents, which is appropriate for the target audience. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast’s informal, conversational tone and the analogies (consultant vs. expert, cramming for an exam, learning to ride a bike). Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is required. The only slight mismatch is the untranslated English term \"cheat sheet\", which could have been rendered as \"hoja de trucos\" or similar, but this does not impair comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No content is omitted, and the explanations remain the same length. Redundancies are not introduced, and the translation stays faithful to the original message.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, keeps the original structure, and remains understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor issues with fluency (a few loanwords and overly long sentences) prevent a perfect score, but they do not hinder comprehension. The translator shows solid grasp of both the subject matter and the target language, delivering a faithful and useful rendition of the podcast dialogue."
