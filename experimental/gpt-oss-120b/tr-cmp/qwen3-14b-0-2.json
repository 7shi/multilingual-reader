  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear order. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia and aprendizaje en contexto are explained with concrete analogies that are easy to follow. Minor hiccups (e.g., occasional use of \"Ella\" for la IA) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural to a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, and most sentences are well‑structured. A few phrases feel slightly forced—\"expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo\" and the repeated use of \"ella\" for la IA—but they are not jarring.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, transferencia, ICL, anclaje, etc., are retained or correctly rendered. The occasional English term \"grounding\" is left in the original, which is acceptable given its technical nature. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts idioms to Spanish culture (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", \"bachotaje\"). The tone remains conversational and educational, matching the podcast format. No culturally inappropriate expressions are introduced.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No sentences or ideas are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The content remains faithful to the original.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the educational and conversational tone of the podcast, and is largely easy to read and natural for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor stylistic tweaks (especially pronoun choice for the IA and a few slightly clunky phrasings) could push the score higher, but they do not detract significantly from the overall effectiveness of the translation.\nOverall score: 18/20"
