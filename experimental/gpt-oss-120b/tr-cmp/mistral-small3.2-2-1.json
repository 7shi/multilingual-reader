  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is easy to follow; sentences are logically ordered and the technical ideas are explained clearly. A small redundancy ('aprendizaje en contexto, o aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)') slightly hampers flow but does not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the text sounds natural to a native speaker. There are a few awkward phrasings (e.g., \"o ventana de contexto\", the duplicate clause, and slightly stiff constructions), but they are minor and do not break the naturalness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding → anclado, etc. The terminology is consistent throughout and appropriate for the intended audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content well for Spanish‑speaking listeners, using idiomatic expressions and culturally neutral examples. The only notable deviation is the change of the podcast name from «Tech Éclair» to «Tecnología Revelada» / «Tecnología Rápida», which slightly alters the original branding.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original dialogue is preserved; no substantive content is omitted. Minor repetitions and the podcast‑name change are the only small losses.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical concepts accurately and remains readable and mostly natural for Spanish speakers. Minor stylistic repetitions and the inconsistent podcast naming are the only drawbacks, but they do not significantly affect the overall understanding.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18/20.\nScore: 18"
