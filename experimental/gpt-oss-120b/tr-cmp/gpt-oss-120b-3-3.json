  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, etc.) are clear and easy to follow. Sentences are not overly long and the podcast‑style dialogue is preserved, making it readily understandable for native readers.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places. Word choices such as “chuleta”, “en segundo plano” and the use of colloquial register suit the informal podcast tone. A few constructions are slightly literal (e.g., «simplemente se ha vaciado su espacio de trabajo temporal»), but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding, etc. The terms are consistently translated and the English acronyms are retained with their Spanish explanations, which is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapted cultural references (e.g., “chuleta” for cheat‑sheet) and maintained the conversational, friendly style of the original. The translation respects Spanish‑speaking listeners’ expectations while preserving the original intent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and nuances from the French source are present. No essential information is omitted, and the content remains concise without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, reads naturally, and adapts well to the target audience’s linguistic and cultural expectations. Minor literal traces are the only noticeable flaws, but they do not affect the overall comprehension or tone. The work is suitable for publication as a Spanish version of the podcast transcript."
