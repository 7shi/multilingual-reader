  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the dialogue clearly and the logical flow of the podcast is preserved. Most sentences are easy to follow, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑specialist can grasp. A few long sentences could be broken up for smoother reading, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are occasional awkward phrasings (e.g., “El preentrenamiento”, “bacotaje”, the space before « olvidado »). Some expressions are literal translations of French idioms that feel slightly stilted in Spanish. Vocabulary is appropriate, yet a few word choices could be more idiomatic.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally kept, but consistency is lacking. \"Fine‑tuning\" is left in English rather than being rendered as \"ajuste fino\" or \"afinamiento\" in Spanish, and the acronym ICL is introduced without a Spanish explanation. The term \"grounding\" is also untranslated. These choices may confuse readers unfamiliar with the English jargon.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the original intent well and respects the podcast’s informal, conversational tone. Cultural references are neutral, so no major issues arise. However, the neologism \"bacotaje\" for \"bachotage\" is uncommon in Spanish and may distract readers. Overall the adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The nuance of the discussion about memory features is fully retained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is clear and faithful to the source, making the technical discussion accessible to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor issues with idiomatic expression and inconsistent handling of technical terminology prevent it from being completely natural, but the overall quality is strong.\n\nStrengths: good readability, faithful content transfer, maintains the podcast’s tone. \nAreas for improvement: smoother phrasing in a few spots, consistent translation of technical terms, replace uncommon neologisms with more standard Spanish equivalents.\n\nOverall rating (average of criteria): 15/20.\n\n**Overall score:** 15"
