  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the dialogue format mirrors the original, making the flow natural for listeners. Complex ideas such as transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained with clear analogies that a Spanish‑speaking audience can grasp without additional background.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. A few minor stylistic choices (e.g., “Vean esto:” instead of a more natural “Miren esto:” or the hyphen in “pre‑entrenamiento”) are slightly awkward but do not break fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently handled: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “ventana de contexto”, “anclaje (grounding)”. The occasional use of English acronyms is kept, which is standard in the field. No important term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., “consultor brillante”). The tone remains conversational and the explanations are adapted to Spanish‑speaking listeners without losing nuance.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the French script is present. No ideas are omitted, and no superfluous information is added. The translation maintains the same length and level of detail, preserving the educational purpose.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, stays faithful to the original dialogue, and is readily understandable for a Spanish‑language audience. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve naturalness, but they do not detract from the overall effectiveness.\n\n**Strengths**: precise terminology, faithful rendering of analogies, clear structure.\n**Areas for improvement**: smoother phrasing in a few spots and consistency in hyphenation of compound terms.\n\nThe translation would serve well in a podcast script or written article aimed at a general‑tech Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\n**Overall score (average of the five criteria)**: 18/20."
