    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original. Most sentences are easy to understand, and the complex concepts are explained in a straightforward way. The occasional use of uncommon words such as *afianzamiento* instead of the usual *ajuste fino* slightly hampers smooth reading, but it does not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few literal renderings feel awkward (e.g., *afianzamiento*, *preentrenamiento* vs. *pre‑entrenamiento*, *silla* for the bicycle seat). These minor slips prevent the text from feeling completely native‑like, yet overall it reads well.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, grounding). The main inconsistency is the choice of *afianzamiento* for *fine‑tuning*, which is not the standard term in Spanish technical literature. Minor inconsistencies in hyphenation also appear.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are appropriate, and analogies are kept. A few idiomatic choices (e.g., *consultor brillante*, *silla* instead of *asiento* for a bike) could be refined, but the overall message is effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is lost, and the structure mirrors the original closely.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and faithful to the source. It communicates the technical discussion clearly and retains the conversational tone of the podcast. The main areas for improvement are the use of more conventional technical vocabulary (especially for *fine‑tuning*) and smoothing a few literal translations that feel slightly stiff. With those adjustments, the text would read as a fully natural Spanish podcast script.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16.2/20 ≈ 16/20."
