    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the main ideas clearly and the flow of the conversation is preserved. Most sentences are understandable, and the technical concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained in a way that a non‑expert can follow. A few sentences are quite long and could be split for easier reading, but overall the text is comprehensible.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several linguistic slips reduce the naturalness: gender errors such as \"El IA\" instead of \"La IA\", the use of English terms like \"fine‑tuning\" without Spanish equivalents, and the odd choice of \"fondeo\" for \"grounding\". The invented acronym AIC (Aprendizaje Interactivo Contextual) is not standard and sounds forced. Some phrasing is awkward (e.g., \"Así es la realidad del AIC\"). These issues make the translation feel less fluid to native speakers.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is inconsistently handled. While \"pre‑entrenamiento\" and \"ventana de contexto\" are appropriate, \"fine‑tuning\" remains untranslated, and \"fondeo\" is a poor translation for \"grounding\" (\"anclaje\" or \"fundamentación\" would be better). The switch from ICL to the non‑standard AIC adds confusion. Consistency and correct Spanish equivalents are lacking.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural references are neutral, and the conversational style is maintained. Minor issues (e.g., the unnatural term \"fondeo\") slightly detract from optimal adaptation, but overall the message is well preserved for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the points from the original French script are present: the description of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of \"memory\" features. No major content is omitted, and the translation does not add irrelevant material.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in transmitting the technical content and the pedagogical tone of the original podcast. However, it suffers from several linguistic inaccuracies (gender errors, inconsistent use of English terms) and some sub‑optimal term choices (e.g., \"fondeo\" for \"grounding\", \"fine‑tuning\" left untranslated, and the invented acronym AIC). These issues affect fluency and terminology scores but do not impede overall comprehension. With a few revisions to correct gender, replace awkward terms with standard Spanish equivalents, and maintain consistent acronyms, the translation would reach a high level of quality.\n\nOverall rating (average of the five criteria): 14.8 → rounded to 15/20."
