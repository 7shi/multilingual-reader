  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the technical concepts are explained in simple language. Only minor issues such as the occasional long sentence and the use of “afinado” instead of the more common “afinación/ajuste fino” slightly affect smooth reading.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate, idiomatic expressions are used (e.g., “es como empollar para un examen”), and punctuation follows Spanish conventions. A few phrasing choices are a bit formal for a podcast style, but they do not break fluency.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), grounding, etc. English terms are kept in parentheses for clarity. The only inconsistency is the translation of “fine‑tuning” as “afinado”, which is less common than “ajuste fino” or “afinamiento”.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The tone of a conversational podcast is preserved (“¡Hola y bienvenidos!”, “¡Una analogía perfecta!”). Cultural references are neutral and appropriate for Spanish‑speaking audiences. No content is lost or mis‑represented.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original script is present. No sentences are omitted, and the technical explanations remain intact. The translation even retains parenthetical notes that help the reader understand English terms.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the original message accurately, reads naturally, and uses suitable technical terminology. Minor improvements could be made in term consistency (e.g., using “ajuste fino” for fine‑tuning) and slightly shortening very long sentences for better pacing in a spoken‑style transcript. Nevertheless, it is a strong, comprehensible Spanish version of the French podcast script."
