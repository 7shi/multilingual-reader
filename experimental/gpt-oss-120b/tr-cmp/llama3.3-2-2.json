    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and the dialogue format is preserved. Most sentences are clear, and complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning) are explained in plain language. However, a few awkward constructions (e.g., \"Cuando abre una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío\", \"Así es la realidad de la Inteligencia Computacional Limitada (ICL)\") and the presence of an editorial comment that does not belong to the original script slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several spots where the wording feels stilted or literal. Examples include \"memoria de corto plazo\" (more idiomatic would be \"memoria a corto plazo\"), the repeated phrase \"aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\", and the incorrect expansion of the ICL acronym. The inserted meta‑comment about alternative phrasing is out of place and breaks the flow. Overall the language is understandable but not fully polished.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are largely handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\" is rendered as \"entrenamiento previo\", \"fine‑tuning\" as \"afinamiento\", \"transfer learning\" as \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", and \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\". The translation of \"window of context\" to \"ventana de contexto\" is appropriate. The main issue is the erroneous reinterpretation of ICL as \"Inteligencia Computacional Limitada\", which misrepresents the concept and may confuse readers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator generally preserves the intent and tone of the original podcast, keeping the conversational style. Cultural adaptation is minimal but adequate for a French‑to‑Spanish audience. The inclusion of an editorial note about alternative phrasing, however, is inappropriate for the target text and detracts from the adaptation. The mis‑named ICL acronym also shifts the intended meaning.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: the distinction between pre‑training and fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent knowledge distinction, and the explanation of \"memory\" features. No substantive content is omitted. The only drawback is the misleading expansion of ICL, which could cause a factual error, but the overall informational content remains largely intact.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core message of the podcast and is largely understandable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. It succeeds in rendering the technical concepts in accessible language and keeps the dialogic structure. Nevertheless, a few linguistic slips, the unnecessary editorial insertion, and especially the wrong expansion of the ICL acronym prevent it from reaching a higher quality level. A revised version that removes the meta‑comment, corrects the ICL terminology, and smooths a few awkward phrases would bring the translation to a near‑native standard."
