  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly logical and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor issues such as occasional long sentences and a duplicated speaker label (\"Luc: Luc:\") do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are several awkward or overly literal renderings (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", \"anclaje (grounding)\", duplicated \"próximo\" and mixed use of \"tú\"/\"usted\"). These reduce the smoothness for native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and appropriate: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, ventana de contexto, etc. However, inconsistency appears between \"ajuste fino\" and \"afinamiento\", and \"anclaje\" is not a standard translation of \"grounding\", which could confuse readers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and purpose of the original are well conveyed. Some cultural‑linguistic choices could be refined (mixed formal/informal pronouns, literal translation of \"consultant\" to \"consultor\"), but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present; no meaningful content is omitted. The only minor flaw is the duplicated speaker tag, which does not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning. Readability and completeness are strong, while fluency and contextual nuance suffer from a few literal renderings and inconsistencies. Terminology is accurate but could be more consistent. Overall, it is a good translation that would be understandable to a Spanish‑speaking audience, though it would benefit from a final edit for naturalness and consistency.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 81/100."
