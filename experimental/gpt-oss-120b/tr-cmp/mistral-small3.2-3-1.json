    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured, the concepts are explained in simple language and the dialogue flow mirrors the original. Minor issues such as the isolated “Veo” (without punctuation) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic; there are no glaringly awkward constructions. The only slight oddity is the inconsistent treatment of the podcast name (localized at the start but left in French at the end).",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, etc. The term “grounding” is kept in parentheses after “anclaje”, which is acceptable for the target audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using familiar analogies and cultural references. The brand name was localized at the opening (“Tecno Revelación”), which helps comprehension, though the later return to the French name creates a minor inconsistency.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original script is present; no ideas or details are omitted. The translation even retains the original closing reference to « Tech Éclair ».",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the original meaning accurately, uses fluent and natural Spanish, and handles technical terminology well. Minor inconsistencies (the podcast name and a tiny punctuation slip) prevent a perfect score, but they do not affect the listener’s understanding.\n\nThe translation would be well‑received by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts and retains the educational tone of the original podcast.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria, rounded): 18.6 → 19/20.\n\n**Final overall score:** 19/20."
