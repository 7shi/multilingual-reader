  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and follows a logical flow. Most sentences are easy to understand, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can follow. Minor hiccups such as the untranslated term \"bachotage\" and a slightly odd rhetorical question slightly reduce smoothness, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part and uses appropriate colloquial Spanish. However, there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotage\", \"¿Por qué ya conoce…?\" instead of \"Porque ya conoce…\"). These affect the overall fluency but remain understandable.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is generally well‑handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" and \"grounding\" are correctly rendered. The French word \"bachotage\" is left untranslated, which breaks consistency, and there is a slight inconsistency between \"ajuste fino\" and \"afinamos\" later in the dialogue.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, adapting cultural references appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The conversational style is kept, and the examples remain relevant. Minor punctuation issues with French guillemets do not affect the message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the dialogue retains its explanatory depth. Redundancies are minimal, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the technical discussion effectively. It is readable and mostly fluent, with only a few lexical and stylistic slips (untranslated \"bachotage\", slight phrasing oddities, and minor term inconsistencies). The technical terminology is well‑chosen, and the original intent is preserved. With minor polishing, it would be an excellent translation for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience.\n\n**Overall score (average of criteria): 17/20**\n\n**Final rating:** 17/20"
