  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow; sentences convey the original ideas clearly and the logical flow is preserved. Some long sentences mirror the French source, but they remain comprehensible for native readers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural, but a few literal renderings (e.g., “Vean:”, “en sus datos”) feel slightly awkward. Vocabulary is appropriate, yet occasional phrasing could be smoother for native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, y anclaje are correctly translated and consistently used. The occasional retention of English acronyms is helpful and does not create confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish, uses culturally appropriate greetings, and maintains the original intent. Minor stylistic tweaks (e.g., punctuation, quotation marks) could be more idiomatic, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is retained. No key points are omitted, and the explanations remain intact. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the technical content clearly. While generally fluent, a few literal constructions make it feel slightly stilted in places. Technical terminology is well handled, and the overall message and tone of the podcast are preserved. The work is of high quality, with room for minor polishing to reach native‑level smoothness.\nOverall Score (average of criteria): 17.8 ≈ 18/20."
