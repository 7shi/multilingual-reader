  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the explanations of concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje y aprendizaje en contexto are clear. A few longer sentences could be broken up for smoother reading, but overall a Spanish‑speaking audience can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation sounds natural, but there are a few literal renderings that feel slightly off to native ears. For example, \"el afinado\" is an uncommon translation for \"fine‑tuning\" (\"ajuste fino\" would be preferred) and the term switches later to \"el ajuste fino,\" creating inconsistency. Phrases like \"consultor brillante\" are acceptable, yet occasional word order feels French‑influenced. These minor hiccups prevent a perfect fluency score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely preserved, e.g., \"ventana de contexto,\" \"Aprendizaje en Contexto (ICL),\" and \"anclaje\" for grounding. However, the translation of \"fine‑tuning\" is inconsistent (\"el afinado\" vs. \"el ajuste fino\"), and \"pre‑entrenamiento\" is sometimes hyphenated. Consistency and the use of the most common Spanish equivalents would improve this dimension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French dialogue to Spanish‑speaking listeners well, keeping the podcast tone and the analogies (e.g., consultant, examen vs. bachotaje). Cultural references are neutral and appropriate, and the intent of the original speakers is preserved. No culturally jarring expressions are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is retained. No key ideas, examples, or explanatory sentences are omitted, and the logical flow of the conversation is intact. The translation also does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the technical content and conversational style of the original podcast effectively. Readability and completeness are strong points, while fluency and terminology could be refined, especially regarding consistent use of established Spanish technical terms (e.g., \"ajuste fino\"). Minor stylistic adjustments would raise the translation from very good to excellent.\n\nOverall score (sum of the five criteria): 84/100."
