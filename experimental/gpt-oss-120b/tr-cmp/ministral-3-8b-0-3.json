    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logical and the flow of the conversation is preserved. A few minor issues (e.g., the use of \"afinado\" instead of a more common Spanish term like \"afinamiento\" or \"ajuste fino\") slightly reduce smoothness, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, but there are occasional awkward constructions and word choices that a native speaker would avoid (e.g., \"memoria de uso único\" instead of \"memoria de un solo uso\", mixed use of Portuguese‑ish \"afinado\"). The use of typographic symbols such as * for italics is uncommon in Spanish prose. Overall, it is understandable but not perfectly fluid.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: preentrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, grounding, etc., are correctly rendered and explained. The only inconsistency is the alternating use of \"afinado\" and \"afinamiento\" for fine‑tuning, which could confuse readers.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast tone, uses appropriate Spanish equivalents for idiomatic expressions, and adapts cultural references without loss of meaning. The style remains conversational and engaging, matching the target audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas, examples, and nuances from the French original are present. No important information is omitted, and the structure mirrors the source accurately.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content clearly and keeps the lively podcast atmosphere. Minor lexical choices (especially the inconsistent use of \"afinado\") and a few slightly stiff phrasing prevent it from being perfect, but the text is fully understandable and technically accurate.\n\nStrengths: completeness, accurate terminology, faithful tone. Areas for improvement: refine word choices for fluency and ensure consistent Spanish terminology for fine‑tuning.\n\nScore out of 100: 90"
