  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the flow of the original dialogue. Most sentences are coherent and the concepts are explained clearly enough for a lay audience. However, occasional long sentences and a few typographical errors (missing accents, inconsistent hyphenation) slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several unnatural expressions and grammatical slips: *« Conociencia temporal »* should be *« conocimiento temporal »*, *« las nuevas conocimientos »* is ungrammatical, a French sentence (*C’est tout à fait ça.*) remains untranslated, and some word choices feel literal (*consultor brillante* instead of *consultor brillante* is okay but the surrounding phrasing sounds stiff). These issues make the translation feel less native‑like.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly handled well: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)*, *ventana de contexto*, *anclaje (grounding)*, etc., are correctly rendered and consistent. Minor lapses (e.g., \"conociencia\" instead of \"conocimiento\") do not break comprehension but show a lack of precision.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator generally preserves the original intent and adapts the content for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are unchanged (which is appropriate), and the explanatory style is maintained. The presence of untranslated French fragments and a few literal translations slightly weaken the adaptation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key ideas from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No major sections are omitted, and the examples (English‑French transfer, consultant analogy, memory feature) are retained. The only loss is the untranslated French sentence, which is a minor omission.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the substance of the podcast accurately and is mostly readable for Spanish speakers. Strengths include correct handling of most technical terms and faithful transmission of the dialogue’s structure. Weaknesses lie in occasional grammatical errors, literal phrasing, and a few untranslated French remnants that detract from fluency and polish. With a final proofreading pass to correct the small linguistic slips, the translation would reach a high‑quality level suitable for publication."
