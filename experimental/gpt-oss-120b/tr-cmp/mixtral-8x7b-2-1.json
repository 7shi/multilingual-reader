    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally clear and the flow of ideas is easy to follow. Most sentences are well‑structured, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in plain language. A few short interjections like “Específicamente.” feel abrupt, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally for the most part, but there are several awkward phrasings (“Específicamente.” as a standalone sentence, “está emergiendo una nueva aproximación”, “rudimentos del lenguaje”). Some word choices (e.g., “intelectual y competente”) are slightly odd for a Spanish audience. Overall, it is understandable but not fully idiomatic.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “ventana de contexto”. The translation of fine‑tuning as “especialización” is acceptable, especially since the original English term is kept in parentheses. Minor inconsistency in hyphenation (pre‑entrenamiento vs preentrenamiento) does not affect understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the content appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience, keeping the podcast tone informal yet informative. The only notable inconsistency is the mixed use of the original French title “Tech Éclair” at the end, while the rest of the episode is called “Tech Iluminado”. Otherwise cultural references and analogies are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the original French script are present. No substantive information is lost, and the explanations remain intact. The only minor lapse is the untranslated English phrase “I am seeing.” which should have been rendered in Spanish. This does not affect the overall message but is a small error.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast’s educational tone and technical content accurately. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency suffers from occasional awkward phrasing. Contextual adaptation is solid, with a tiny inconsistency in the podcast title. Apart from one untranslated line, the information is complete. Overall, it is a good translation that would be easily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners, though a native‑speaker edit could smooth out the remaining rough spots.\n\n**Overall score:** 86 / 100"
