  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clearly presented. However, a few fragments remain in French (e.g., \"Camille: D'accord.\") and the ending offers several alternative podcast names, which can confuse the reader. These issues slightly break the flow.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, using idiomatic Spanish and appropriate punctuation. Minor awkwardness appears in very long sentences and in the occasional retention of English/French terms in bold, but overall it sounds like a native speaker wrote it.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently and correctly: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por contexto, anclaje, competencia permanente, estructura interna, etc. The only drawback is the occasional leftover French word and the mixed use of English \"pretraining\" in bold, which is unnecessary.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references (e.g., consulting analogy) well and uses Spanish‑appropriate wording. The presence of a long meta‑explanatory pre‑amble and multiple possible podcast titles at the end, however, detracts from a clean adaptation to the target audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the essential points of the original dialogue are retained: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of the \"memory\" feature. Minor omissions (the untranslated \"D'accord\" and a few filler interjections) are present but do not affect the core message.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and uses appropriate Spanish terminology. It is mostly readable and fluent, though the occasional French remnants, the unnecessary meta‑explanatory block, and the ambiguous final naming choices prevent it from being perfectly polished. With a bit of editing to remove leftover French and streamline the ending, it would be an excellent Spanish version of the podcast script.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 16/20."
