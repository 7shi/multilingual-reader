    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original French script. Most sentences are easy to understand, and the technical concepts are explained in a straightforward way. The only drawback is the occasional insertion of French phrases (e.g., \"C'est une excellente remarque,\") which can momentarily disrupt comprehension for a Spanish‑only reader.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, using appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic structures. However, there are a few awkward constructions and untranslated fragments (\"C'est une excellente remarque,\" and the abrupt \"¿Entonces es un truco?\" after a French line). These glitches prevent the text from being completely smooth for native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"memoria a corto plazo\", etc. The term \"anclaje\" for \"grounding\" is acceptable, and the acronyms (ICL) are kept. Minor inconsistency appears with the French phrase left untranslated, but it does not affect the terminology itself.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast tone and purpose, adapting cultural references appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only notable issue is the leftover French sentence, which breaks the cultural adaptation and could confuse readers unfamiliar with French. Otherwise, the adaptation is good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information present in the French original is conveyed in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is kept intact. The small French fragment does not cause loss of meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. Readability and terminology are strong points, while fluency and cultural adaptation suffer slightly due to a few untranslated French snippets and occasional awkward phrasing. With minor edits to eliminate the French remnants and smooth out a couple of sentences, the translation would be near‑perfect for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\n**Total score (average): 17/20**"
