  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are easy to follow. Sentences are clear and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are well expressed. Minor issues such as occasional hyphenation (\"pre‑entrenamiento\") do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but a few expressions feel slightly awkward for native speakers: \"el afinado\" is not the usual term for \"fine‑tuning\" (\"ajuste fino\" is preferred), and some punctuation choices are unusual. These minor slips keep the fluency just below optimal.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is largely preserved and appropriate. Acronyms (ICL, grounding) are kept, and key concepts (ventana de contexto, aprendizaje por transferencia) are correctly rendered. The only drawback is the translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"el afinado\", which is less common in Spanish technical literature.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone accurately. Cultural references are neutral, and the style matches a podcast dialogue in Spanish. No idiomatic mismatches are observed.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is present. No sentences or ideas have been omitted, and the added clarifications (e.g., \"el modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus discusiones\") aid comprehension without altering meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality, preserving the technical depth and conversational tone of the original podcast. Minor lexical choices (e.g., \"el afinado\") and occasional hyphenation keep it from being perfect, but the content is fully intact and readily understandable for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\nOverall score: 18/20."
