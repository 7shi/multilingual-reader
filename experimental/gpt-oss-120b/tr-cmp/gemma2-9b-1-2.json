  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the logical flow of the original dialogue. Most sentences are clear, and complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto are explained in a way that a Spanish‑speaking audience can follow. However, occasional remnants of French (e.g., “C’est tout à fait ça”, “C’est donc una memoria…”) and mixed‑language fragments slightly disrupt comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several moments where the translation sounds literal or awkward: mixed French‑Spanish phrases, literal renderings like “On puede decir eso” and the preservation of French sentences break the natural flow. Vocabulary is generally appropriate, but the presence of untranslated fragments makes the text feel less smooth for a native speaker.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly handled correctly. Key terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto” and “ICL (In‑Context Learning)” are preserved and consistent. The occasional use of the French word “ancrage (grounding)” is acceptable given the original context, and no major technical inaccuracies are introduced.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original podcast tone and intent, making the content relevant for Spanish listeners. Cultural references are neutral and thus transferable. The main drawback is the leftover French snippets, which slightly reduce the adaptation quality but do not alter the overall message.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the original French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant points are omitted, and the dialogue structure is maintained. Minor issues are the untranslated French sentences that could be considered missing translations, but the factual content remains intact.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and retains most of the technical explanations, making it informative for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Strengths include correct handling of terminology and preservation of the conversational structure. Weaknesses lie in occasional French remnants and literal phrasing that affect fluency and readability. A thorough proof‑read to remove mixed‑language fragments would raise the overall quality significantly.\nOverall score (out of 100): 74/100."
