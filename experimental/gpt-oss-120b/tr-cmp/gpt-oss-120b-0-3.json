  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and complex concepts are explained in a straightforward manner. Minor issues such as occasional long sentences do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most of the script. There are a few slightly awkward phrases (e.g., \"Mire, más bien:\" and the use of \"afinamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\"), but overall the language flows well and uses appropriate colloquial register for a podcast.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", etc. The choices are accurate for a Spanish‑speaking audience and maintain coherence throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and informal podcast style. Cultural references are adapted (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenidos\"), and the use of Spanish punctuation and quotation marks is appropriate. No cultural mismatch is observed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French original is present. No sentences or ideas are omitted, and the explanation of memory features and the distinction between ICL and fine‑tuning remains intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content accurately while keeping the conversational, accessible tone of the podcast. Minor lexical tweaks could improve fluency, but they do not affect the overall effectiveness of the translation.\n\nFinal score (sum of criteria): 92/100.\n\nRecommendations: consider using \"ajuste fino\" instead of \"afinamiento\" for fine‑tuning and smooth out a couple of colloquial interjections to make the speech feel even more natural to native listeners.\n\nScore out of 100: 92/100.\n\n(Note: each criterion is out of 20, total possible 100.)"
