  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are generally short and logical, and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, etc.) are clear. A few minor typographical quirks (e.g., spacing before ‘!’) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, but there are occasional slightly awkward constructions such as “un documento de información exactos” (plural vs singular) and the use of “empollar” which, while understood, is less common than “estudiar intensamente”. These issues are minor and do not break the flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled consistently: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, anclaje, prompt, etc. Most terms are correctly translated or left in the original English with parentheses, which is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts cultural references well (e.g., using “empollar” for cramming, “consultor brillante”). The intent and tone of the original podcast script are preserved, and no culturally inappropriate expressions appear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the ideas, examples, and analogies from the French original are present. No substantive information is lost or added, and the logical sequence of the discussion is maintained.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains readable and mostly fluent, and respects the original tone. Minor grammatical slips and occasional less‑idiomatic phrasing keep it from being perfect, but they do not affect the listener’s understanding.\n\nStrengths: faithful rendering of concepts, consistent terminology, good cultural adaptation.\nWeaknesses: a few awkward word choices and minor agreement errors.\nThe translation would be fully polished after a light proofreading pass.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
