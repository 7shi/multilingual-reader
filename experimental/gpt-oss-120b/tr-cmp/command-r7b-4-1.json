  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the main ideas are conveyed, but many sentences are overly long, repetitive, and contain redundant phrasing (e.g., repeated explanations of pre‑training). The frequent use of exclamation marks at the start of sentences and occasional awkward constructions make the flow less smooth for the reader.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Numerous expressions sound unnatural to native speakers: literal translations like \"¡El preentrenamiento!\", the verb \"afinar (afinar)\" for fine‑tuning, English words left untranslated (\"fundamentally\", \"prompt\"), and inconsistent abbreviations (\"IC\" instead of \"ICL\"). The overall style is stilted and sometimes grammatically incorrect.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly rendered correctly (preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto), but several are mishandled: \"fine‑tuning\" becomes \"afinar (afinar)\" instead of the usual \"ajuste fino\", \"grounding\" is rendered as \"anclaje\" which is uncommon, and English terms occasionally appear unchanged. Consistency is lacking.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and explanatory purpose, yet it fails to adapt the tone to a Spanish‑language podcast format. The excessive exclamation marks, literal phrasing, and occasional cultural mismatches (e.g., overly formal explanations) reduce natural engagement with the target audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present; no significant information is omitted. Some sections are expanded with redundant restatements, but the core content—including examples, analogies, and the discussion of memory features—is retained.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation communicates the essential concepts about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning, but the quality is hampered by repetitive wording, lack of fluency, inconsistent terminology, and occasional untranslated English fragments. It would benefit from a thorough stylistic rewrite to improve readability and sound more natural to Spanish‑speaking listeners while standardising technical vocabulary.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 66/100."
