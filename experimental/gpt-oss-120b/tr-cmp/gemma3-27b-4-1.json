    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and the flow of ideas mirrors the original French dialogue. Most sentences are clear and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can understand. Minor issues such as the literal translation \"Pre‑capacitación\" for \"pré‑entraînement\" and a few redundant or slightly confusing phrasings (e.g., \"aprendizaje puntual\" instead of a clearer \"bachotaje\") prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally for the most part, but there are occasional awkward constructions: \"Ventana contextual\" (acceptable but less common than \"ventana de contexto\"), duplicated adverbs \"automáticamente\" and \"de forma automática\", and the final brand name change to \"Tech al Instante\" which feels forced. These small hiccups lower the fluency rating.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly handled well (e.g., \"anclaje\" for grounding, \"ventana de contexto\"). However, the translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"optimización\" is not the standard term in Spanish‑language AI literature, where \"ajuste fino\" is preferred. The abbreviation ICL is omitted, and \"pre‑entraînement\" is rendered inconsistently as \"Pre‑capacitación\". These inconsistencies affect the terminology score.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original intent and adapts the content for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the explanatory tone is kept. The only notable deviation is the change of the podcast title from \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Tech al Instante\", which alters the original branding and slightly detracts from faithful contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, transfer learning, fine‑tuning vs. in‑context learning, temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the “memory” feature. Minor details such as the explicit mention of the abbreviation ICL and the exact phrasing of some analogies are softened but not lost. No substantive information is omitted, giving a solid completeness rating.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is good and conveys the technical discussion clearly to a Spanish‑speaking audience. The main drawbacks are the inconsistent handling of specific AI terminology, a few awkward phrasings, and the unnecessary alteration of the podcast’s name. With a few refinements—using standard terms like \"ajuste fino\", keeping the original brand name, and smoothing out redundant expressions—the translation would reach a higher level of polish.\n\nFinal overall score (out of 20): 15"
