  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to understand. Sentences are generally clear and the logical flow mirrors the original French dialogue. Minor hiccups (e.g., the use of “sillón” instead of a more appropriate term for a bike saddle) do not impede comprehension, but they slightly affect the natural reading experience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few expressions feel a bit formal or awkward for a podcast script (“Usted ha comprendido todo”, “Es el aprendizaje en contexto en marcha”). The word “sillón” is a clear slip. Overall, the language is fluent and would be understood without effort.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “ICL”, “grounding” → “anclaje”. The translation respects the jargon used in the AI community and provides appropriate Spanish equivalents where needed.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original are preserved. The translation adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., using “bachotaje” for cramming). The only drawback is the occasional mismatch of register (formal “usted” mixed with a conversational style) and the inaccurate “sillón”.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No content is omitted, and no extraneous material is added. The translation remains faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and maintains the explanatory flow of the podcast. Minor lexical slips (e.g., \"sillón\") and a slightly formal register in places prevent a perfect score, but the text is clear, natural, and technically sound for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.4 → 18/20."
