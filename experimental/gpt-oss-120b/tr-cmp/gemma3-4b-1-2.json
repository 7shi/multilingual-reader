    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is difficult to follow. Speaker labels are duplicated (e.g., “Camille: Camille:”), there are stray quotation marks, unfinished sentences and fragments of the evaluator’s own notes that interrupt the flow. The paragraph breaks do not match the original dialogue, and several sentences are abruptly cut off. A reader would have to work hard to reconstruct who is speaking and what is being said, so overall comprehension is low.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While some sentences are rendered correctly (e.g., “el aprendizaje por transferencia”), many expressions are literal or awkward (e.g., “el afinamiento” instead of the more common “fine‑tuning”, “aprendizaje en contexto” is acceptable but the surrounding phrasing is stilted). The text contains English fragments (“ICL”, “grounding”), inconsistent punctuation, and duplicated speaker tags, which make the prose sound unnatural to a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are partly preserved (pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning → afinamiento, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto). However, the handling is inconsistent: “grounding” is left untranslated, “memory” appears as «Memoria» without explanation, and some English acronyms remain. The translation does not always provide the brief clarifications that would help a non‑expert audience.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent of explaining AI training concepts, but the inclusion of meta‑analysis text (the whole “Syntactic Analysis” section) is inappropriate for a podcast script and distracts the reader. Cultural references are unchanged, which is fine, but the extra editorial material shows a lack of adaptation to the target medium.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Key ideas from the original are present (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory tricks), but many details are lost or garbled. Several sentences are truncated, speaker tags are corrupted, and some explanatory parts are omitted or replaced by evaluator notes. Consequently, the translation is not fully complete.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is far from publishable. It mixes the intended podcast dialogue with the evaluator’s internal notes, contains duplicated speaker labels, inconsistent terminology, and numerous syntactic and punctuation errors. Although the core technical concepts are roughly conveyed, the poor readability, lack of fluency, and missing information make the text unsuitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience without substantial editing and cleaning up of artifacts.\n\nA proper revision should strip out all meta‑analysis commentary, correct speaker attributions, ensure consistent use of technical terms (e.g., keep \"fine‑tuning\" as \"ajuste fino\" or \"afinación\"), and rewrite awkward literal translations into natural Spanish. Only then will the script be clear, fluid, and faithful to the original French content."
