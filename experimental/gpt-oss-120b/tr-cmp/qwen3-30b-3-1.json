  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained clearly. A few long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but overall a native reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are several literal renderings that feel slightly awkward to a native speaker (e.g., “refinamiento” for fine‑tuning, “estudiar de memoria” for cramming, “ventana de contexto”). Vocabulary is appropriate, yet occasional phrasing betrays the source language structure.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly translated: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, ventana de contexto, anclaje, etc. The biggest issue is the choice of “refinamiento” for fine‑tuning, which is not the standard term in Spanish literature (normally “ajuste fino” or “fine‑tuning”). Apart from that, the terminology is consistent and understandable for the intended audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the original intent and tone of the podcast script. Cultural references are minimal, and the language is adapted to a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only minor inconsistency is the mix of “Tech Relámpago” at the start and “Tech Éclair” at the end, which could cause slight confusion.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No key ideas or examples are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary material. The content remains faithful to the original while staying concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the technical discussion accurately and is comprehensible for a Spanish‑speaking audience. It could be improved by adopting more idiomatic terminology (especially for fine‑tuning) and smoothing out a few literal constructions. Consistency in the podcast name would also enhance clarity. The translation is solid but leaves room for refinement to reach native‑level fluency.\n\nTotal score: 79/100."
