    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and the flow of ideas follows the original. Most sentences are easy to understand, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener could follow. Minor issues such as the wrong preposition in “¡Hola y bienvenido **en** ‘Tech Éclair’” and the sudden switch to the formal “Usted” reduce smoothness slightly, but they do not block comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, but there are a few awkward constructions: the formal “Usted ha entendido todo” is inconsistent with the informal tone of the podcast, the preposition error mentioned above, and occasional literal translations like “prompt” that remain in English. These quirks make the text feel a little stilted for a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto* and the abbreviation ICL are all correctly rendered. The choice to keep “grounding” in parentheses is acceptable, and the term “prompt” is left in English, which is common in AI discourse. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and explains the concepts for a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, the shift to formal address (“Usted”) and the preposition mistake slightly affect cultural adaptation and register. Apart from that, the adaptation is faithful and appropriate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No meaningful content is omitted, and the order of ideas remains the same. Minor stylistic differences do not affect the completeness of the information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. It captures the nuances of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning while keeping the conversation lively. Small linguistic slips—particularly the inconsistent formality and a prepositional error—prevent it from being perfect, but they do not hinder the listener’s understanding. The terminology is accurate and consistent, and the content is complete.\n\nThe translation would benefit from a final proofreading pass to harmonize the register (using \"tú\" consistently) and fix the few preposition/idiom issues. After those tweaks, it would be close to native‑level quality.\n\nScore (average of the five criteria): 16.8 → **17/20**."
