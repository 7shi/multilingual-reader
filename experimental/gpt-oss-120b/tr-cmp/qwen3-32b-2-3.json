    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and conveys the main ideas. Most sentences are clear, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. Minor issues such as the gender mismatch in \"Linterna Tecnológico\" and a few overly long sentences slightly reduce smoothness, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally, but there are a handful of awkward constructions (e.g., \"expansión en masa de la memoria de corto plazo\", \"memoria de uso único\"). Some phrases feel literal translations from French rather than idiomatic Spanish. Overall, a native speaker would understand it, but the flow could be smoother.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" (anclaje). The translation keeps English acronyms (ICL, AEC) and explains them, which is appropriate for the target audience. A few minor inconsistencies (e.g., \"memoria de uso único\" instead of \"memoria de un solo uso\") do not cause confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original podcast script are preserved. Cultural adaptation is adequate, though the title \"Linterna Tecnológico\" should be \"Linterna Tecnológica\" to respect Spanish gender rules. Retaining the original French podcast name \"Tech Éclair\" at the end is acceptable because it is a proper name. Overall the adaptation respects the target audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue. The translation adds no unnecessary redundancy and maintains the completeness of the explanations.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original material accurately and is largely understandable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Strengths include solid handling of technical terminology and faithful transmission of the podcast’s educational tone. Weaknesses are mainly stylistic: a few gender errors, some literal phrasing, and occasional awkward constructions that slightly affect fluency. With minor edits to improve naturalness and correct gender agreement, the text would be excellent for its intended audience.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
