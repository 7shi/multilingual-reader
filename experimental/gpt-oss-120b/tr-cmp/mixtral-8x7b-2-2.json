  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. Most sentences are clear, and complex concepts are explained with appropriate analogies. Minor issues such as the stray English phrase “I am seeing.” and occasional redundant wording slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., “La persona o cosa de la que se está hablando olvida todo.”) and some untranslated English fragments. Vocabulary is appropriate, yet the occasional literal translation creates a stilted feel.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, afinación (fine‑tuning), aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, anclado, etc. Consistency is mostly maintained, though the hyphenation of “pre‑entrenamiento” vs. “preentrenamiento” varies. Overall, terminology is accurate and understandable.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The podcast tone is well adapted to a Spanish‑speaking audience, and cultural references are neutral. The title “Tech Iluminado” works, but the final mention of “Tech Éclair” is left untranslated, and the residual English phrase detracts slightly from full adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present: pre‑training, transfer learning, fine‑tuning vs. in‑context learning, temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No substantive information is omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and maintains the educational podcast style. It is readable and technically sound, though occasional literal translations and leftover English fragments affect fluency and cultural polish. With minor edits to smooth out awkward phrases and ensure full language consistency, the text would reach a higher level of naturalness.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 16/20."
