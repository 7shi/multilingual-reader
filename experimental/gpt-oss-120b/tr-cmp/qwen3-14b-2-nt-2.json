  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the complex ideas are clearly expressed. The sentence structure is logical and the dialogue flows well. The only drawback is the retention of the French phrase “D’accord.” which momentarily disrupts comprehension for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic, but there are a few slips: the sudden shift to the formal “Usted” in “Usted entiende todo.” while the rest of the conversation is informal, and occasional literal renderings that feel slightly stiff. These issues prevent a perfect fluency rating.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled expertly: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, etc., are all translated consistently. The only minor point is the parenthetical “(fundamentación)” for grounding, which is a less common translation but still understandable.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast tone and adapts cultural references appropriately. The informal, conversational style is mostly kept, though the isolated formal address and the untranslated French interjection slightly reduce cultural alignment.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original script is present; no substantive content is omitted. The only exception is the untranslated French interjection “D’accord.” which is a tiny loss of completeness but does not affect the overall message.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation from French to Spanish is of high quality. It conveys the technical concepts accurately, maintains the original’s explanatory depth, and is largely readable and natural. Minor issues such as a leftover French phrase, inconsistent formality, and a slightly odd parenthetical translation prevent it from being flawless, but these do not hinder overall understanding.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20.\nScore: 18"
