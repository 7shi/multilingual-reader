  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the concepts are explained clearly. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the dialogue format is preserved, making it easy for a Spanish‑speaking audience to follow. Minor issues are a few long sentences that could be split for extra clarity, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic, and most expressions match native usage. A few constructions (e.g., «una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado», punctuation around the final question) feel slightly stilted, but they do not break fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, etc. The only term that could be debated is «anclaje» for grounding, which is understandable but less common than «anclaje semántico» or «referenciación». Nonetheless the terminology is accurate and coherent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish and keeps cultural references intact. The opening title is changed to «Tecno Revelación», preserving the spirit of the original. The final mention of the French name «Tech Éclair» is retained, which may be a tiny inconsistency but does not affect the overall intent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and analogies from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No relevant detail is omitted, and the flow of arguments is maintained. Redundancies are avoided, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the original content while being largely clear, natural, and technically accurate. Minor stylistic tweaks (splitting a few long sentences, refining the term «anclaje», polishing punctuation) would bring it even closer to native‑speaker perfection, but the current version is already excellent for a podcast audience.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18/20.\n\nScore: 18"
