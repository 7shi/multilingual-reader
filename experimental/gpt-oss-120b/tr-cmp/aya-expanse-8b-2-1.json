    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original. Sentences are logical and the explanations of concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia and aprendizaje en contexto are easy to follow. Minor issues like the occasional over‑use of exclamation marks and a slightly clunky phrasing in a few places do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward constructions (e.g., “¡Exactamente! El aprendizaje contextual es similar a copiar para un examen”, “El afilado” for “affinage”, and the inconsistent acronym LCI). Vocabulary is appropriate, yet the repetition of “¡Exactamente!” and the unusual word choices reduce overall smoothness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved (pre‑entrenamiento, ventana de contexto, grounding → anclaje). However, the term “afilado” is not the usual Spanish rendering of “affinage” (should be “ajuste fino”), and the acronym switch from ICL to LCI creates confusion. Consistency could be improved.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone effectively, adapting the metaphor of a consultant and the analogy of cramming for an exam to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are kept neutral and appropriate. Minor phrasing oddities do not affect the overall message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is retained. No important detail is omitted, and the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning and memory features are complete. The translation is faithful to the source content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the original content well, but it suffers from some terminology inconsistencies and occasional unnatural phrasing. Fixing the term “afilado” to “ajuste fino” and keeping the ICL acronym consistent would raise both fluency and technical precision. Overall, it is a solid translation that is understandable and informative, though not perfectly polished for a native Spanish audience.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
