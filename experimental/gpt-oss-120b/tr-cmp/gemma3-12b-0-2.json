  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the complex concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning) are explained in plain language. Minor punctuation quirks do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, using appropriate colloquial style for a podcast. A few expressions feel slightly forced (e.g., \"Se puede decir eso\" instead of \"Podemos decirlo\", \"bachatear\" is not a common verb), but overall the flow is smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\". The English loanwords are correctly rendered or kept in parentheses, which is suitable for a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational tone and cultural references are well adapted to Spanish‑speaking listeners. The analogy of a \"consultor brillante\" works nicely. The only notable slip is the use of \"bachatear\", a non‑standard verb, which slightly breaks the naturalness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present. No relevant detail is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The meaning of each segment is preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is high‑quality, conveying the technical content and podcast‑style dialogue clearly and accurately. Minor issues with a few unnatural phrasing choices prevent it from being perfect, but they do not affect the understanding of the material. The translator has done an excellent job preserving terminology and intent while keeping the text readable for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\n**Total score:** 88 / 100 (average 17.6 / 20 per criterion)."
