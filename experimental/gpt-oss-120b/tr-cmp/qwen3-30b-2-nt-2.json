  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the ideas are presented logically. Sentences are generally clear, and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. Minor issues are the occasional very long sentence that could be split for smoother reading.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are a few awkward constructions: \"consultor temporario\" (more common would be \"consultor temporal\"), \"refinamiento\" instead of the usual \"ajuste fino\", and some redundancy such as \"aprendizaje contextual, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\". These do not break comprehension but affect native‑speaker smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding → anclaje. However, \"refinamiento\" is not the standard translation for \"fine‑tuning\" (\"ajuste fino\" is preferred) and \"consultor temporario\" is a less common choice. Consistency is good otherwise.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the intent and tone of the original podcast, adapting metaphors (e.g., \"consultor brillante\") appropriately for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Cultural references are neutral and well‑suited. Small phrasing choices could be refined, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant details are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue closely.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the full content of the original podcast. It is readable and faithful, though a few terminology choices (\"refinamiento\" vs \"ajuste fino\", \"consultor temporario\") and occasional awkward phrasing prevent it from being completely natural for native speakers. Minor edits could raise fluency and technical precision, but the overall quality is high and suitable for the intended audience."
