  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is cluttered with parenthetical explanations, alternative translation suggestions, and occasional switches back to French or English. Sentences are long, often broken by meta‑comments, making it hard for a Spanish‑speaking reader to follow the podcast dialogue. The flow is fragmented, so comprehension suffers.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Numerous unnatural constructions appear (e.g., “pre‑entrenamiento”, “procesamiento de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto” used inconsistently, mixing of French and English terms, and overly formal or stilted phrasing). The language sounds more like a translation guide than a natural conversation.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)* are present, but they are sometimes left in French, sometimes in English, and occasionally explained with redundant parenthetical notes. Consistency is lacking, and some terms are over‑explained, which can confuse readers.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation frequently deviates from the original intent by inserting translation advice, alternative phrasings, and explanatory footnotes that would never appear in a podcast script. Cultural adaptation is therefore minimal; instead, the text feels like a bilingual annotation, which is inappropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Important parts of the original dialogue are omitted or replaced by meta‑comments. Conversely, the translation adds material that was not in the source (e.g., detailed translation guidelines). Consequently, the core content of the conversation is not fully preserved.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The provided ‘translation’ is more a hybrid of a translation draft and a set of editorial notes than a finished Spanish version of the podcast. It is difficult to read, contains many awkward phrasings, mixes languages, and fails to deliver the original conversational tone. Technical terminology is inconsistently handled, and essential information is lost or obscured by the extraneous commentary. Substantial editing would be required to turn this into a coherent, natural‑sounding Spanish podcast script.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 5/20."
