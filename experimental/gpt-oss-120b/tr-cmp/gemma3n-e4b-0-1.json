  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and follows a logical progression. Sentences are generally easy to follow and the complex ideas about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. Minor issues such as a shift from the formal \"Ustedes\" to the informal \"Podéis\" and occasional punctuation quirks slightly reduce smoothness, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, using appropriate Spanish constructions and idiomatic phrasing. There are a few awkward spots (e.g., mixed registers, occasional literal calques like \"memoria de un solo uso\" which, while understandable, sounds a bit forced). Overall, a native speaker would find it fluent with only minor hiccups.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are correctly rendered and consistent. The English term \"fine‑tuning\" appears once, but the surrounding context clarifies it, so it does not cause confusion. The choice of terms matches the expected knowledge level of the podcast audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural references are neutral, and the conversational style fits a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience. The only drawback is the occasional shift in second‑person pronoun that slightly disrupts the uniformity of address, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French original is retained. No substantive content is omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as in the source. Redundancies are not introduced, and the translation stays concise while preserving the full meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality, conveying the technical concepts clearly and accurately while maintaining a conversational tone suitable for a podcast. Minor inconsistencies in pronoun use and a few slightly unnatural phrasings keep it from being perfect, but they do not detract significantly from comprehension or the educational value. Overall, it is a strong, professional translation that would be well‑received by Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\nOverall Score (average of criteria): 17.6 ≈ 18/20."
