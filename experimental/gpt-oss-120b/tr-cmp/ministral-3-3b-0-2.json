    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences convey the original meaning, and complex concepts are explained with examples. However, there are a few clunky constructions (e.g., “aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (aprendizaje en contexto dentro del contexto)”, “informaciónes”) and some over‑use of asterisks that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but occasional unnatural phrasing and minor typographical errors betray a non‑native feel. Phrases like “Vea:” and the redundant parenthetical definition of ICL feel awkward, and the typo “informaciónes” breaks fluency. Overall, a native speaker would understand it, but the flow is not completely smooth.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Core terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"anclaje\" are correctly rendered and consistent throughout. The decision to keep \"prompt\" in italics is acceptable for a technical audience. No major mistranslations of jargon are found.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using appropriate punctuation and style. Minor issues (e.g., \"quien utilice estos herramientas\" instead of \"estas herramientas\") slightly affect cultural appropriateness, and the inclusion of the English‑origin slang \"crunchar\" may be unfamiliar, but the surrounding explanation mitigates this. Overall, the intent and tone are preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original script is present. No significant ideas or examples are omitted, and the added parenthetical clarification for ICL does not change the meaning. Small typographical errors do not cause loss of content. The translation remains faithful to the source.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. Terminology is well managed, and the overall message of the podcast episode is preserved. The main weaknesses are minor grammatical slips, occasional awkward phrasing, and a few typographical errors that slightly reduce readability and fluency. With a light proofreading pass, the text would reach a high level of naturalness for native Spanish speakers."
