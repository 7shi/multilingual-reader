  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Sentences are mostly well‑structured, making the technical discussion easy to follow for a reader familiar with AI concepts. A few very long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, using appropriate colloquial phrasing (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", \"una hoja de apuntes\"). There are minor awkward spots such as the redundant parenthetical \"ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\" and the literal rendering of \"El aprendizaje en contexto es memorización\" which could be phrased more fluidly. Nonetheless, a native speaker would understand it without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL) and \"anclaje\" for grounding. The choice of \"afinamiento\" over the more common \"ajuste fino\" is acceptable, and all terms are explained where needed. No major mistranslations are observed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French‑French podcast tone to a Spanish‑speaking audience effectively. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogies (consultant vs. expert, learning to ride a bike) work well in Spanish. Minor stylistic adjustments could improve the flow, but the intent and purpose are fully preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original script are retained: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the notion of temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No significant information is lost or added unnecessarily.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and keeps the conversational style of the podcast. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency could be polished in a few spots. The adaptation respects the target audience’s expectations and retains the full informational content. The work merits a solid 88/100 across the evaluated criteria."
