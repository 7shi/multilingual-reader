  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to understand. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are clear. A few minor phrasing choices are slightly cumbersome, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, but there are some awkward or inconsistent expressions: “Usted ha comprendido todo” mixes formal “usted” with the informal tone used elsewhere, and a few sentences are longer than necessary. Vocabulary is appropriate, yet a couple of small grammatical slips prevent a perfect native feel.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, etc., are correctly rendered and used consistently. The only small lapse is leaving the word “prompt” in English, which could have been translated or explained, and keeping “grounding” in English without a Spanish equivalent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural references are neutral, and the dialogue feels suitable for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience. Minor issues with formality (mix of “tú” and “usted”) slightly affect the adaptation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is present. No key points, examples, or nuances are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The content remains concise and faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and remains easy to follow. Minor fluency inconsistencies and the occasional untranslated term keep it from being perfect, but they do not detract significantly from the listener’s understanding.\n\nStrengths: clear explanations, correct technical terminology, faithful content transfer. \nAreas for improvement: ensure consistent register (avoid mixing \"tú\" and \"usted\"), translate or explain isolated English terms like \"prompt\", and smooth out a few overly long sentences for a more natural flow.\n\nThe translation would be well‑received by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18/20."
