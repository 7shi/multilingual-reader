  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version contains a large duplicated segment (the whole dialogue is repeated with errors such as \"Camille: Soy Luc.\") and several unfinished or abruptly cut sentences. This makes the flow hard to follow and forces the reader to constantly re‑orient themselves. Basic comprehension is therefore impeded.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are many awkward phrasings (e.g., \"Lee una gran cantidad de datos en Internet\" instead of a more natural \"Lee una enorme cantidad de datos\"), grammatical mismatches (mixing masculine/feminine pronouns for IA), and literal translations that sound stilted. The duplicated block also introduces incoherent syntax. Overall the text does not read as natural Spanish.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL) and \"anclaje (grounding)\". However, \"afinamiento\" is a less common translation for \"fine‑tuning\" (\"ajuste fino\" would be preferred) and the term \"memoria a corto plazo\" is repeated without clarification. Consistency is decent but not perfect.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally keeps the original intent, but the duplicated and garbled sections break the cultural and contextual flow. Some sentences are overly literal (e.g., \"Le modèle\" → \"El modelo\" is fine, but \"El preentrenamiento\" lacks the article \"El proceso de preentrenamiento\"). The adaptation therefore feels incomplete and occasionally jarring.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Important information is largely present, but several lines are omitted or corrupted (e.g., the line \"Camille: C'est logique.\" is missing, and the duplicated block introduces noise while dropping some original nuances). Redundancy from duplication does not add value and actually obscures the original content.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the bulk of the technical discussion, but its quality is severely compromised by a massive duplicated segment, numerous grammatical slips, and occasional mistranslations of key terms. While the core concepts are recognizable, a reader would find the text confusing and would need a cleaned‑up version to fully understand the podcast script. Substantial editing is required to reach an acceptable standard for native Spanish speakers."
