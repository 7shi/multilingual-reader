  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are short and the flow mirrors the original dialogue, making the concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) understandable for a non‑expert audience. A few minor issues (e.g., occasional long clauses) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most of the script, but there are occasional awkward choices: \"El preentrenamiento\" (often written *pre‑entrenamiento*), \"El afinamiento\" instead of the more common *ajuste fino*, and the mixed use of feminine pronoun \"ella\" for IA, which is acceptable but not uniform. Overall, the language is smooth but not completely idiomatic.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well handled: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje (grounding), memoria a corto plazo, etc. The translator kept the English acronyms and provided parenthetical explanations where needed, maintaining consistency throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast’s introductory style to Spanish and respects the informal, conversational tone. The only slight inconsistency is the mixture of the original French name \"Tech Éclair\" at the ending, which may confuse some listeners, but overall the intent and cultural tone are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the nuances (e.g., the analogy of \"bachotage\", the explanation of memory tricks) are retained. Redundancy is minimal and the content stays concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content clearly and keeps the lively podcast atmosphere. Minor fluency hiccups and a small inconsistency with the program name prevent a perfect score, but the work is accurate, complete, and easily understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17.6 → 18/20."
