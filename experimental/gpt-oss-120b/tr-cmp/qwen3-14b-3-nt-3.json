  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences are clear, and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained adequately. The only notable hiccup is the typo \"crammar\" (instead of \"crammer\"/\"estudiar a último momento\"), which slightly hampers comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are a few awkward constructions: \"Aprendizaje Contextual Instruccional (ICL)\" is an odd literal rendering of ICL, \"Se le ha dado una pista justo antes de que empezara a hablarte\" feels clunky, and the typo \"crammar\" is non‑existent in Spanish. Apart from these, the vocabulary is appropriate and the style matches a podcast script.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"anclaje\" are correct. The main issue is the mistranslation of ICL as \"Aprendizaje Contextual Instruccional\", which adds an unnecessary qualifier and could confuse readers. Overall consistency is good.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a conversational tech podcast. Cultural references are neutral and the style is suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor literalness (e.g., keeping \"prompt\" unchanged) is acceptable, but the typo \"crammar\" shows a lapse in adapting the expression to Spanish.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present; no major ideas are omitted. The only deviation is the added word \"Instruccional\" in the ICL translation, which is an unnecessary addition rather than an omission. The translation remains comprehensive and concise.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is solid and conveys the technical content of the original podcast clearly. It reads fairly well and retains the educational tone, with only a few lexical slips (the \"crammar\" typo and the odd ICL rendering) that prevent it from being flawless. The terminology is mostly accurate, and the script remains engaging for a Spanish‑speaking audience. With minor polishing, the text would reach a near‑native quality level.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15.6 → 16/20."
