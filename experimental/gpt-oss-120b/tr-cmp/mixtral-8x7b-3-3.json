    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the logical flow of the original dialogue. Most sentences convey the intended meaning, but there are several awkward phrasings (e.g., “Hola y estáis invitados a ‘Tech Éclair’”, “El AI olvida toda la información”) and occasional typographical inconsistencies (pre‑entrenamiento vs preentrenamiento). These hiccups slightly hinder smooth comprehension for a native reader.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many literal renderings and remnants of English or French that feel out of place for a native Spanish speaker. Phrases such as “The provided draft translation is accurate and requires no improvement.” are left untranslated, and terms like “Inteligencia en el Lenguaje Conversacional (ICL)” sound unnatural. While the overall meaning is clear, the text does not flow as naturally as native‑level Spanish.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly preserved, but the handling is inconsistent. “Fine‑tuning” is kept in English with a parenthetical translation, which is acceptable, yet “grounding” is rendered as “enraizamiento (‘ancraje’)”, an uncommon choice; “Mémoire” is left in French. The Spanish equivalents for some concepts (e.g., “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”) are correct, but the mixture of languages and occasional mis‑translations reduce consistency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation does not fully adapt the style to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Introductory greetings like “Hola y estáis invitados” are awkward, and cultural references are untouched. Moreover, some French terms remain (Mémoire) and English fragments persist, which can confuse readers unfamiliar with those languages. The intent is conveyed, but the adaptation could be smoother.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No substantive content is omitted, and the dialogue structure is retained. The only minor issue is the inclusion of a meta‑sentence about the draft translation, which does not affect completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in transmitting the technical content and the conversational structure of the original podcast. However, it suffers from several fluency and stylistic problems, such as literal translations, mixed‑language fragments, and occasional misuse of terminology. Improving the naturalness of expressions, ensuring consistent use of Spanish technical terms, and fully adapting cultural references would raise the overall quality significantly.\n\nOverall, the work is functional but not yet polished for a native‑speaker audience.\n\nOverall Score (average of the five criteria): 14/20"
