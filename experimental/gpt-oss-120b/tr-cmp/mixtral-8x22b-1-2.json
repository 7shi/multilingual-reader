  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original dialogue structure. Most sentences are clear, but there are several typographical glitches (e.g., \"discusiĆ³n\", mixed French/Spanish markers) and occasional awkward phrasing that can momentarily confuse the reader.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally, yet several expressions feel literal or stilted (e.g., \"El afinamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\", \"ancrado\" for \"grounding\"). Mixed language fragments and encoding errors also break the flow.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved, but the handling is inconsistent. \"Pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"ICL\" are correct, whereas \"afinamiento\" and \"ancrado\" are less standard in Spanish technical discourse. The translation could benefit from more consistent use of established Spanish terminology.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the podcast tone and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., keeping the show name \"Tech Éclair\"). However, the inclusion of a confusing line \"French: C'est-à-dire ? Spanish: ¿Cómo es eso?\" detracts from a smooth adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key ideas from the original are present; no major sections are omitted. Minor issues such as occasional missing articles or slight re‑ordering do not affect the conveyed information. Overall, the content is complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original message and retains most of the technical content, but it suffers from several linguistic imperfections: typographical errors, non‑standard terminology, and occasional literal renderings that make the text feel less natural to native Spanish speakers. Improving terminology consistency, fixing encoding glitches, and polishing awkward phrases would raise the quality considerably.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 15/20, Fluency 13/20, Terminology 12/20, Contextual Adaptation 14/20, Information Completeness 18/20. Total: 72/100.\n\nOverall, the translation is functional but needs refinement to reach a high‑quality, native‑level standard."
