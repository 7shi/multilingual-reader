  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained in simple terms. Minor punctuation quirks do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are occasional awkward constructions (e.g., \"Ustedes han comprendido todo\", \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje automático contextualizado\"). The register is appropriate for a podcast, yet a few phrases could be smoother.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well‑handled: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding, etc. The inconsistency of using \"afianzamiento\" instead of the more common \"afinamiento\" for fine‑tuning may confuse readers, and \"ajuste fino\" is later replaced by a less usual synonym.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the informal podcast style to Spanish well, using greetings like \"Hola y bienvenidos\" and keeping the conversational tone. Cultural references are preserved, and the name \"Tech Éclair\" is kept as a brand. No cultural mismatches are observed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas from the original French script are present. No significant information is omitted, and the flow of the dialogue remains intact. The translation even retains the final French episode name, which is appropriate for a brand name.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the original content accurately. Readability and completeness are strong, and the technical terminology is largely appropriate, though the switch from \"ajuste fino\" to \"afianzamiento\" introduces a slight inconsistency. Fluency could be polished in a few spots to sound more native. Overall, the work is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience.\n\n**Overall score (out of 100): 87**"
