  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure, but several sentences are overly long or awkwardly phrased. There are noticeable typographical errors such as “la afinanción” instead of “el afinamiento”, and the insertion of “Luc destaca:” inside a quote breaks the flow. These issues slightly hinder smooth comprehension for a native reader.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many literal renderings that sound unnatural in Spanish. Phrases like “Luc destaca: 'La clave del proceso de entrenamiento…'” and “Tal es la realidad del Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural (PLN)” feel forced. Vocabulary is mostly correct, but the overall rhythm is uneven, making the text feel stilted.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, memoria a corto plazo, etc.) are correctly translated and used consistently, with the exception of a typo (“la afinanción”). The term “prompt” is left in English, which is acceptable for a technical audience but could have been glossed. Overall the terminology handling is solid.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast tone and cultural references, but some expressions are too literal (e.g., “Luc destaca:” inside a quoted speech). Certain sentences could be re‑phrased to better suit Spanish‑speaking listeners, but the intent of the original is clearly conveyed.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French original are present. A few minor additions (e.g., mention of “ajuste continuo”) appear, but they do not distort the message. No crucial information is omitted, and the content remains faithful to the source.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in transmitting the core concepts of the podcast and uses appropriate technical vocabulary. However, it suffers from several linguistic flaws—typos, awkward constructions, and occasional over‑literal phrasing—that reduce its naturalness and readability. A thorough proofreading and some stylistic smoothing would markedly improve the quality.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
