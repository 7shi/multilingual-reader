  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is riddled with unfinished sentences, abrupt topic switches, and literal placeholders (e.g., “* (implicit, referring to the speaker's logical assessment) - **Predicate:** *”). A reader would constantly lose the thread of the conversation. Many parts are incomprehensible (e.g., “You can take”, “Luc: This is”, “Camille: one”). Consequently the passage is far from easy to understand.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mixes Spanish, French, English and raw markup. Word order is often wrong (“Leverage le voile” appears as “lever le voile” unchanged), and several expressions are literal calques that do not exist in Spanish (“el afinado”, “ventana de contexto” used correctly but surrounded by gibberish). The result sounds like a machine‑generated draft, not natural Spanish.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning”, “transfer learning”, “in‑context learning”, “grounding” are sometimes kept in English or French, sometimes partially translated. There is no consistent handling, and no explanatory notes where needed (e.g., “ventana de contexto” could be clarified).",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original podcast tone (friendly, explanatory) is lost. Cultural references are untouched, but the garbled translation prevents the intended message from being delivered. The adaptation does not consider Spanish‑speaking audience expectations.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are omitted or truncated. Sentences like “Luc: You can take a model expert in English, then give it a much smaller amount of French text” become “Luc: You can take” and are incomplete. Important explanations about transfer learning, memory, and the distinction between fine‑tuning and ICL are missing or broken.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The supplied translation is far from a usable Spanish version of the French podcast script. It appears to be an intermediate draft that was never cleaned up: many fragments remain in the source language, English placeholders are left in, and sentences are cut off. Readability, fluency, terminology handling, contextual fidelity and completeness are all severely compromised. A complete rewrite, keeping the conversational flow and correctly translating technical terms, is required before the text can be presented to Spanish‑speaking listeners."
