  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the complex ideas about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained clearly. A few long sentences could be broken up, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic, and the dialogue format is preserved. Minor hiccups such as “el aprendizaje en contexto, es estudio intensivo” and occasional literal renderings (e.g., “ventana de contexto”) are slightly awkward but do not break the flow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, anclaje (grounding), memoria, ICL, etc. The translator kept the original acronyms and gave Spanish equivalents where needed, which is suitable for the target audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the original intent and tone of a podcast conversation. Cultural references are neutral, and the examples (consultor brillante, aprender a montar en bicicleta) work well in Spanish. Slightly literal phrasing in a couple of spots does not affect the overall message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No key points are omitted, and the order of the dialogue is preserved. The translation also adds no unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, reads smoothly for Spanish‑speaking listeners, and retains the podcast’s conversational style. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but the overall effectiveness is strong.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.4 → 18/20.\n\nScore: 18"
