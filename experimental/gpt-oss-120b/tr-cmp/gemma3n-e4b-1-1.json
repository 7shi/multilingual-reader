  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the main ideas, but several passages mix French (e.g., “¿C'est?”, “Voyez plutôt”) or retain translator‑notes, which interrupt the flow and can confuse a reader. Sentence structures are generally clear, yet the presence of untranslated fragments makes the text harder to follow for a native Spanish audience.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural expressions and outright errors: “Exattamente”, “¿C'est?”, the insertion of meta‑commentary about translation choices, and occasional clumsy phrasing (“exponerlo a una cantidad mucho menor”). These issues prevent the text from sounding like a smooth, native‑speaker podcast script.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and “grounding” are correctly rendered and used consistently. Minor lapses (e.g., not translating “ICL” the first time) do not seriously affect comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator generally respects the original intent and keeps the educational tone. However, the inclusion of French words and the translator’s explanatory block detracts from cultural adaptation. When the Spanish is pure, it is appropriate, but the mixed‑language artifacts lower the overall adaptation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the substantive content of the original dialogue is present; no major ideas are omitted. The only drawback is the extra, non‑original translation commentary, which adds noise but does not remove information.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in transmitting the technical concepts and maintains the structure of the podcast dialogue, but it is marred by unfinished localization, residual French fragments, and unnecessary translator notes. These issues affect readability and naturalness, making the text feel more like a draft than a polished Spanish version ready for broadcast. A thorough clean‑up—removing French remnants, correcting misspellings, and eliminating meta‑comments—would raise the quality considerably."
