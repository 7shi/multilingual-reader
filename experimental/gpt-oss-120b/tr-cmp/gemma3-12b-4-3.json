    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and follows a logical flow. Most sentences convey the original ideas without ambiguity, and the technical concepts are explained in an accessible way. Minor issues such as very long sentences and the parenthetical “*truco* (or *apunte*, or *resumen rápido*)” slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, but there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., “el modelo mismo”, “una forma astuta de aprendizaje automatizado en contexto”) and occasional literal translations that sound stilted. The mix of English words inside the Spanish parenthesis also breaks fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding, memoria a corto plazo, etc. Consistency is maintained and the few untranslated terms (grounding) are acceptable in the current discourse.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the original intent, tone, and did not introduce cultural mismatches. The analogy of a consultant and the discussion of memory features are well adapted to Spanish‑speaking audiences.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No relevant detail is omitted, and the structure mirrors the source closely.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does an excellent job of conveying the technical content and overall narrative of the podcast. Readability and completeness are strong, and terminology is handled well. Fluency suffers from a handful of literal or clumsy phrasing and an odd multilingual parenthetical, which prevent it from being completely natural. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation that would be easily understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience, with only minor polishing needed for full native smoothness.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 17, Fluency 15, Terminology 19, Contextual Adaptation 18, Information Completeness 20. The average yields an overall score of 18/20."
