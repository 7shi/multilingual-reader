  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are easy to follow. Sentences are generally short and the concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto, afinado) are explained clearly. Minor hiccups such as the repeated parenthetical “Aprendizaje en Contexto (ACL)” do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward or overly literal renderings (e.g., “Eso sería incalculablemente ineficiente”, “la IA no está siempre ajustada o mejorada por tus conversaciones”, the repeated “Aprendizaje en Contexto”). These phrases feel slightly stiff to a native speaker.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved, but there are inconsistencies. “Fine‑tuning” is rendered as “entrenamiento ajustado” (acceptable), yet the key acronym ICL is mistakenly changed to “ACL”, which could confuse readers familiar with the literature. The term “ventana de contexto” is correctly used, and “grounding” is explained as “anclaje”. Overall the terminology is adequate but not flawless.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the podcast format, maintains the informal conversational tone, and adapts cultural references (e.g., “hola”, “consultor brillante”). No major cultural mismatches are present, and the message of temporary vs. permanent knowledge is conveyed effectively.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the major points from the French original are present: pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, diferencia entre memoria temporal y permanente, y la explicación de las funciones de “memoria”. The only minor loss is the incorrect acronym change (ICL → ACL). No substantive content is omitted.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is clear, faithful to the source, and preserves the educational tone of the podcast. It succeeds in making complex AI concepts accessible to Spanish‑speaking listeners. The main drawbacks are a few unnaturally phrased sentences and a notable terminology error (ICL rendered as ACL). Fixing these would raise the translation to a near‑perfect level.\nOverall rating: 17/20."
