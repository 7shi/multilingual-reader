    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the original dialogue structure. Most sentences convey the intended meaning, and complex ideas are explained with adequate examples. However, there are occasional long, clunky sentences and a few confusing phrasings (e.g., \"Inteligencia Computacional Limitada (ICL)\"), which can hinder smooth comprehension for a reader unfamiliar with the topic.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several expressions are awkward or literal translations of French constructions (e.g., \"expansión masiva de la memoria de corto plazo de la IA, o «contexto»\", \"Así es la realidad de la Inteligencia Computacional Limitada (ICL)\"). The use of \"afinamiento\" for \"fine‑tuning\" is acceptable, yet the overall flow is interrupted by occasional syntactic oddities and redundant parenthetical explanations.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely preserved: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"afinamiento\". The major issue is the mistranslation of the acronym ICL (In‑Context Learning) as \"Inteligencia Computacional Limitada\", which is misleading. The concept of \"ventana de contexto\" is not explicitly used, even though it appears in the original French as \"fenêtre de contexte\". Consistency suffers in a few places.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly retains the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Nonetheless, it includes unnecessary meta‑comments (the parenthetical note about alternative phrasing) that break the conversational flow and feel out of place for the target audience. Some cultural adjustments are missing, such as using more idiomatic Spanish for \"consultor brillante\" (could be \"consultor experto\").",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the notion of temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of \"memoria\" features. No essential information is omitted, though the extra meta‑comment adds noise rather than clarity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the core content and structure of the original podcast but is marred by several inaccuracies (notably the wrong expansion of ICL), occasional unnatural phrasing, and superfluous editorial notes. With minor revisions to terminology, smoother sentence constructions, and removal of the meta‑commentary, the text would be much clearer and more natural for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14/20."
