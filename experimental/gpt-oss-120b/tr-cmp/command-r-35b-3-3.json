    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the flow of ideas follows the original. However, some sentences are cumbersome (e.g., the long clause about “retención consistente del conocimiento a lo largo de múltiples sesiones”) and a few minor grammatical slips (“no olvida como lo haría nosotros”) reduce smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation sounds natural and uses appropriate vocabulary. There are occasional awkward constructions (“una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”, “el modelo no aprende ni se desarrolla…”) that a native speaker would phrase differently, but they do not break the text.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), grounding, etc. The terminology is consistent throughout and appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent of the original is mostly preserved and the podcast name is kept, which is acceptable. The translation adds a misleading statement that the context is retained across multiple sessions, which deviates from the original meaning and could confuse readers.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All main ideas from the French script are present, but the added claim about multi‑session retention introduces inaccurate information. No major omissions, but the inaccuracy affects completeness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation conveys the technical discussion clearly and uses appropriate terminology. Readability and fluency are good, though occasional awkward phrasing and a notable factual distortion (suggesting long‑term retention across sessions) prevent it from being excellent. Minor edits would bring it to a higher level of quality.\n\nScore (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
