  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured, and complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) are explained with smooth transitions. Minor hiccups such as the slightly long sentence about “el espacio de trabajo temporal” do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary (e.g., “chuleta” for cheat‑sheet, “ventana de contexto”). A few phrases feel a little literal (“expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo”), but overall the flow is smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently and correctly: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), grounding (anclaje). English acronyms are kept with Spanish explanations, which matches typical practice in Spanish technical discourse.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator has adapted cultural references and idioms (e.g., “chuleta” instead of “antisèche”). The tone remains informal and podcast‑like, preserving the original’s engaging style. No cultural mismatches are evident.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original script is present. No sentences or ideas have been omitted, and the final sign‑off retains the original podcast name, which is appropriate. Redundancy is minimal.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, reads naturally, and respects the informal, conversational tone of the podcast. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but they do not affect comprehension. The work is suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI fundamentals.\n\nStrengths: precise terminology, clear explanations, good cultural adaptation.\nAreas for improvement: smooth some slightly literal constructions and consider shorter phrasing for very long sentences.\n\nFinal rating reflects a strong performance with only small, non‑critical issues.\n\nScore out of 20: 17.6 (average of the individual criteria)."
