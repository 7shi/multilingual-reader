  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the dialogue flow mirrors the original. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained clearly, making the content accessible to non‑specialist listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native Spanish speaker, but a few literal renderings feel slightly awkward (e.g., “aprendizaje transferido” instead of the more idiomatic “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje automático en contexto”). Overall the language is smooth and the vocabulary appropriate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “ventana de contexto”, “anclaje”. There is some inconsistency in keeping English terms in parentheses and occasional non‑standard translations (e.g., “aprendizaje transferido”). Still, the meaning is preserved and the terminology is understandable.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French podcast style to a Spanish‑speaking audience effectively. Cultural references are neutral, and the explanatory tone is maintained. Minor idiomatic improvements could be made, but the intent and purpose are fully conveyed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the source script is retained. No sections are omitted or unintentionally altered, and the examples and analogies are kept intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality: it conveys the technical content clearly, retains the conversational tone of the podcast, and is mostly natural Spanish. Minor lexical choices and occasional literal translations prevent a perfect score, but the work is accurate, complete, and readily understandable for the target audience.\nOverall score: 86/100."
