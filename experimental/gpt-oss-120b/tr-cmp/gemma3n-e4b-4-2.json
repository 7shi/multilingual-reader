  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is easy to follow. Sentences are generally short and logical, and the technical concepts are explained clearly. The only minor drawback is the occasional mix of French («Bonjour») which may slightly interrupt the flow for monolingual Spanish readers.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural in most places, but there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., “¡Bonjour y bienvenido”, “la transferencia de aprendizaje”, “es tiempo de concluir/terminar/finalizar”). These do not hinder comprehension but reduce the smoothness expected from a native‑speaker style.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding → anclaje a datos, etc. The phrase “la transferencia de aprendizaje” is slightly less idiomatic than “el aprendizaje por transferencia”, but the meaning is preserved and terminology is consistent throughout.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original podcast tone and adapts cultural references for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The occasional retention of French words (Bonjour, Tech Éclair) is intentional and does not damage comprehension. Overall the intent and purpose are conveyed effectively.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is retained. No segment is omitted, and no extra, misleading content is introduced. The translation faithfully mirrors the original dialogue.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the full content accurately and maintains the conversational style of the podcast. Minor issues with fluency and occasional mixed‑language wording prevent it from being perfect, but they do not affect the overall understanding. The handling of technical terminology is solid, and the text is readily understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nOverall score: 18/20."
