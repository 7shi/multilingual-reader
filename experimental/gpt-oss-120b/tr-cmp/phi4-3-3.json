  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences preserve the logical flow of the original French dialogue, and complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia o aprendizaje en contexto are explained with simple analogías. Minor issues (e.g., gender disagreement in \"vuestra datos\") do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native speaker, but a few awkward constructions and typographical quirks lower the fluency: \"vuestra datos\" (should be \"tus datos\" or \"sus datos\"), spacing around the guillemets, and slightly stilted phrasing such as \"nos vemos hasta pronto\". Overall, the language is smooth, but these hiccups prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento/fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding/anclaje) are either correctly translated or kept in the original acronym with an appropriate explanation. Consistency is maintained throughout the dialogue.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using familiar analogies (consultor brillante, bachotaje, montar en bicicleta). However, the use of \"vuestros\"/\"vuestra\" reflects a European‑Spanish register that may feel odd for many Latin‑American listeners, and some expressions could be more idiomatic. The intent and tone are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No relevant details are omitted, and the structure mirrors the source closely. Minor punctuation differences do not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the technical content effectively. Readability and terminology are strong, and the core ideas are preserved. Fluency and cultural adaptation have a few minor flaws (gender agreement, regional register) that prevent a flawless rating, but overall the work is high‑quality and suitable for a podcast audience.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 17, Fluency 16, Terminology 19, Contextual Adaptation 17, Information Completeness 20. Total: 89/100.\n\nRecommendations: adjust pronouns to a consistent regional variant (e.g., use \"tus datos\" for Latin America), correct gender agreement, and tidy up punctuation around quotation marks for a more polished final version.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 89"
