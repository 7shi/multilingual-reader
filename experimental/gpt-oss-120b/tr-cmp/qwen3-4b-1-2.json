  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are conveyed clearly. Sentences are logical and the flow mirrors the original. Minor lexical slips such as “las conocencias” instead of “los conocimientos” slightly hinder smooth comprehension, but they do not break understanding.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward expressions (e.g., “prueba de fuego” for “antisèche”, “una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”, and occasional clunky phrasing). These reduce the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms like pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, ventana de contexto, ICL and anclaje are correctly rendered. There is a small inconsistency with “fine‑tuning” sometimes left in English, and the word “conocencias” is incorrect, but overall terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the podcast tone and adapts cultural references adequately. The mis‑translation of “antisèche” as “prueba de fuego” is a noticeable mismatch, yet the overall intent and register are preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present; no major ideas are omitted. The only issues are the aforementioned lexical errors, which do not cause loss of meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion effectively. It is readable and mostly fluent, with accurate handling of most terminology. A few lexical inaccuracies (e.g., \"conocencias\", \"prueba de fuego\") and some slightly unnatural phrasing prevent it from reaching a higher level of polish. With minor edits, the text would be fully natural for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\nOverall score (average): 16/20."
