  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear order. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia and aprendizaje en contexto are explained in simple terms, making the content easy to follow for a non‑specialist audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for native speakers. Most phrasing is idiomatic (e.g., \"una enorme cantidad de datos en Internet\", \"entre bastidores\"). A few minor hiccups appear – the switch from \"afinamiento\" to \"ajuste fino\" and the colloquial \"chuleta\" – but they do not break fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is handled well: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding → \"anclaje\". The only drawback is slight inconsistency between \"afinamiento\" and \"ajuste fino\", and \"anclaje\" is a less common translation for \"grounding\", though still understandable.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the conversational tone to Spanish, using familiar expressions like \"pódcast\" and \"chuleta\" that resonate with the target audience. Cultural references are preserved, and the informal, podcast‑style dialogue feels authentic.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All points from the original French script are retained: the description of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of the so‑called \"Memoria\" feature. No content is lost or unintentionally added.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the original meaning accurately, keeps the technical depth, and reads naturally for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor inconsistencies in terminology and a touch of colloquialism prevent a perfect score, but the work is excellent for a podcast script aimed at a broad audience.\nOverall score (out of 100): 89/100."
