  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are clear. A few minor hiccups (e.g., a French phrase left untranslated) do not break comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward or incorrect expressions: *«conociencia»* instead of *«conocimiento»*, missing agreement in *«las nuevas conocimientos»*, and the French sentence *«C'est tout à fait ça»* that slips through. These errors make the prose feel slightly stilted for native speakers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Core terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto* and *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)* are kept or correctly adapted. The occasional French term (e.g., *grounding*) is left in English, which is acceptable in a technical podcast, but the translation could have offered a Spanish equivalent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original intent, tone and pedagogical style. Analogies (consultant vs. expert, cramming for an exam) are rendered appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor cultural slips (the residual French sentence) slightly reduce the adaptation quality.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key points of the original dialogue are present: the distinction between pre‑training and fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent nature of knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No substantive information is omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the technical content accurately and is quite readable. The main drawbacks are a few grammatical slips, a wrong word (*conociencia*), and a leftover French sentence. Fixing these would bring the translation to a near‑native level of fluency and polish.\nScore out of 20 (average of the five criteria): 17"
