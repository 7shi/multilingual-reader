    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but several interruptions (isolated words like \"pre‑entrenamiento\" on their own lines) and typographical glitches (missing commas, stray \"Et\" before \"yo soy Luc\") break the flow. The narrative jumps back and forth, making it harder for a reader to follow the dialogue smoothly.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are numerous unnatural expressions: \"Tech Flash\" instead of the original title, \"ancraje\" for \"grounding\", and the mixed‑language phrase \"la 'Mémoire'\". The use of exclamation marks, missing accent marks, and occasional literal translations (e.g., \"bachotear\" for \"cramming\") give the text a stilted, machine‑like feel rather than a natural conversational Spanish.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mishandled. \"Fine‑tuning\" is rendered as \"afinamiento\", which is acceptable, but \"grounding\" becomes \"ancraje\" (the correct term is \"anclaje\" or simply \"grounding\" in Spanish). The title \"Tech Éclair\" is inconsistently translated as \"Tech Flash\" and later left unchanged, causing confusion. Overall term consistency is low.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the original intent, but cultural and contextual nuances are missed. For instance, the informal tone of a podcast is sometimes broken by abrupt line breaks. The title change to \"Tech Flash\" suggests a mis‑adaptation rather than a thoughtful localisation. Some explanations are overly literal and could be simplified for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",

    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the main ideas from the French script are present; no major sections are omitted. However, some details are weakened by the translation errors (e.g., the concept of \"Mémoire\" is left untranslated, which could mislead readers about the feature). Redundancies are minimal, but the occasional stray words reduce clarity.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the overall structure and most of the content, but it suffers from several lexical, grammatical, and stylistic errors that affect readability and naturalness. Inconsistent handling of the podcast title, misuse of technical terms, and fragmented dialogue lines make the Spanish version feel rough and partially machine‑generated. A thorough human revision would be needed to bring the text to a professional, fluent level suitable for a podcast audience.\n\n**Suggested improvements**:\n- Keep the original podcast name \"Tech Éclair\" or adapt it consistently.\n- Replace \"ancraje\" with \"anclaje\" and translate \"Mémoire\" as \"memoria\".\n- Remove isolated words and ensure each speaker’s line is a complete sentence.\n- Polish punctuation and accentuation, and adjust colloquial phrasing to sound natural in Spanish.\n- Verify that all technical concepts are explained clearly, using terminology familiar to Spanish‑speaking tech listeners."
