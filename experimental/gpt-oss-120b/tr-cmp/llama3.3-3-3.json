  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the logical flow of the original dialogue. Most sentences are clear, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can follow. However, the inclusion of an editorial comment inside the translation (the parenthetical note about “Ella olvida todo”) breaks the reading flow and may confuse the audience. A few minor punctuation issues and occasional redundant phrasing also slightly affect smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly sounds natural, but there are several awkward constructions (e.g., “Ustedes han entendido todo”, “hasta la próxima para el próximo episodio”, inconsistent use of “afinamiento” / “perfeccionamiento”). The meta‑comment mentioned above is a clear non‑native artifact. These issues prevent the text from being fully fluid for native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto” and “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)” are correctly rendered. The term for fine‑tuning, however, is inconsistently translated (“afinamiento”, “perfeccionamiento”), which could cause slight confusion. Overall, the terminology is appropriate and consistent enough for the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator captures the informal podcast tone and adapts cultural references (e.g., “Hola y bienvenidos”, “Es un placer tenerlos aquí”). The intent of the original is preserved. The unnecessary editorial note detracts from the adaptation, but the rest of the text respects the target audience’s expectations.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French source are present; no substantive information is omitted. The translation even adds a small introductory sentence that does not alter meaning. The only drawback is the insertion of the parenthetical comment, which is extraneous but does not remove any content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast’s content accurately and maintains the overall educational tone. It handles most technical terminology well and is largely complete. Nevertheless, the presence of an editorial meta‑comment, inconsistent terminology for fine‑tuning, and a few unnatural phrasing choices lower the overall quality. A cleaned‑up version that removes the extraneous note and standardises key terms would reach a higher level of fluency and readability.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
