    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are clear. A few minor hiccups (e.g., “ICL (Inteligencia Computacional Linguística)” and occasional long sentences) slightly affect flow, but the overall comprehension is good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several literal renderings that feel awkward to native speakers: \"Inteligencia Computacional Linguística\", \"es del bachotaje\", and the mix of French terms like \"ancrage\" left untranslated. Verb tenses and article usage are generally correct, yet the occasional stilted phrasing reduces overall smoothness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved (pre‑entrenamiento, afinación, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto). However, the expansion of the acronym ICL is wrong – it should be \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" – and the French word \"ancrage\" is left unchanged instead of using the Spanish \"anclaje\". These inaccuracies affect precision.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and adapts examples (e.g., consultant analogy) well for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor issues such as retaining the French podcast name at the end (\"Tech Éclair\" instead of the Spanish \"TecnoDestello\") and the slightly literal phrasing of some concepts slightly diminish cultural resonance.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent knowledge distinction, and the explanation of “memory” features. No significant content is omitted, though the mis‑labelled ICL expansion introduces a small factual error.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and successfully transmits the technical content to Spanish readers. It is readable and mostly fluent, but suffers from a few terminology mistakes and occasional literal phrasing that make it feel less natural. With minor corrections (proper handling of ICL, translating \"ancrage\", and polishing awkward sentences) the quality would rise to a near‑native level.\nOverall score reflects these strengths and weaknesses.\nScore out of 20: 15/20.\n\nOverall rating: 15/20 (good, but room for improvement)."
