  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences are clear, but there are a few minor hiccups (e.g., gender mismatch in the podcast title, occasional formal “usted” that feels out‑of‑place for a casual podcast, and the isolated line “El preentrenamiento.”). These do not block comprehension but slightly reduce smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but some phrasing is awkward: “Linterna Tecnológico” (gender error), “El aprendizaje en contexto es memorizar”, “las informaciones”, and the use of “indicación” for prompt. Such choices feel a bit stilted to native ears, though the overall flow remains understandable.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well handled: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL) and grounding are correctly rendered. The occasional substitution of “prompt” by “indicación” is acceptable, and the added acronym AEC does not cause confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and podcast tone, but the title inconsistency (\"Linterna Tecnológico\" vs. later \"Tech Éclair\") and the shift to a formal register in some places slightly detract from cultural adaptation. Otherwise, the content is suitably adapted for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is retained. No important idea is omitted, and the added parenthetical AEC acronym does not alter meaning. The translation is comprehensive.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. Minor grammatical slips, a gender error in the podcast title, and a few unnaturally formal or clunky expressions prevent a higher score, but the core content, terminology and explanatory flow are well preserved.\nThe translation would benefit from a quick proofread to fix gender agreement, streamline the register, and replace a handful of awkward phrases, after which it would approach native‑level quality.\nScore out of 20 (average of the five criteria): 17"
