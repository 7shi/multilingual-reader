  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, but numerous typographical errors, missing accents, and inconsistent punctuation interrupt the flow. Some sentences are awkwardly constructed, which can force the reader to re‑read for clarity.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many non‑native constructions (e.g., \"¡Usted lo ha entendido todo.\", \"cuando begins\", \"encaje\"), inconsistent use of formal/informal pronouns, and leftover English terms. These issues make the prose feel stilted rather than natural.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"ICL\" are correctly rendered. However, \"grounding\" is mistranslated as \"encaje\", and the word \"prompt\" is left untranslated, which may confuse readers.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely preserves the original intent and style, but the register fluctuates (mix of \"tú\" and \"usted\"), and cultural adaptation is limited. The misuse of \"encaje\" shows a lack of contextual awareness.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present; no significant ideas are omitted. Minor phrasing issues do not lead to loss of information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning, but it is hampered by several linguistic errors, inconsistent register, and a few mistranslated technical terms. A thorough edit focusing on fluency, proper terminology (especially \"grounding\"), and consistent style would markedly improve the quality.\n\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 65/100 (average 13/20)."
