  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear order. Sentences are mostly short enough for easy comprehension and the complex concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) are explained with analogies that work in Spanish. Only a couple of very literal renderings (e.g., “el modelo experto en inglés” instead of “un modelo experto…”) slightly slow the reading, but they do not hinder understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate, idiomatic expressions such as “un consultor brillante” or “una hoja de trucos” are well chosen. A few minor clunky phrases appear (e.g., “masiva expansión de la memoria a corto plazo” could be smoother), yet overall the text reads smoothly without jarring grammar errors.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly handled: preentrenamiento, afinamiento (ajuste fino), aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding, etc. When a French term is kept, its Spanish equivalent is given in parentheses, preserving clarity. Consistency is maintained throughout, and no key term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the tone to a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience (e.g., greeting with “¡Hola!” and using familiar analogies). Cultural references are neutral, and the style matches the informal‑educational format of the original. Slightly formal register in some parts but still appropriate for the target listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No sentences are omitted, and the nuances (e.g., the distinction between temporary knowledge and permanent skill) are fully retained. The translation does not add irrelevant material nor does it lose any detail.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, this is a high‑quality translation. It conveys the original content accurately, uses appropriate technical vocabulary, and reads naturally for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic tweaks could make a few sentences smoother, but they do not detract from the clarity or fidelity of the translation. The translator succeeded in preserving the educational tone and the nuanced distinction between fine‑tuning and in‑context learning.\n\nScore: 91/100 (sum of the five criteria)."
