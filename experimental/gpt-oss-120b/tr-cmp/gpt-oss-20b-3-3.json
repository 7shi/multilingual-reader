    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured, and complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) are explained with suitable analogies. Minor typographic issues (e.g., “pre‑entrenamiento” vs. “preentrenamiento”) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. A few expressions feel slightly stiff (e.g., “el espacio de trabajo temporal simplemente se ha vaciado” could be smoother), but overall the flow is smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinación (fine‑tuning)”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “ventana de contexto”, “anclaje (grounding)”. The choice of “afinación” is acceptable, though “ajuste fino” is more common in the literature. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately. The analogies (consultant, cramming for an exam) are kept and make sense in Spanish. Minor punctuation differences (e.g., missing accent on “¿”) are negligible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present. No significant omissions or additions are detected. The translation is concise yet thorough, retaining the full logical sequence of the conversation.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains readable and natural, and respects the original tone of the podcast. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but they do not detract from the effectiveness of the translation.\n\n**Strengths:** clear explanations, correct technical terminology, faithful to the source. **Areas for improvement:** smoother phrasing in a couple of sentences and uniform handling of hyphenated compounds.\n\n**Overall score (average of criteria):** 18.2/20, rounded to 18/20."
