  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can understand. A few minor phrasing choices (e.g., “una cantidad considerablemente menor”) are slightly less smooth but do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker, with only a handful of awkward expressions such as the duplicated “(anclaje)” and the colloquial exclamation “¡Lo has comprendido todo!”. Overall the flow is smooth and the vocabulary is appropriate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, etc. The term “grounding” is rendered as “anclaje”, which is acceptable in Spanish technical discourse. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original intent well for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are preserved, the consulting‑analogy works in Spanish, and the tone of the podcast is kept. Minor redundancy (the double “(anclaje)”) slightly detracts but does not affect the message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present; no ideas are omitted or altered. The translation even keeps the parenthetical acronyms and examples, ensuring full coverage of the source content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate, faithful to the source, and largely natural. Minor phrasing quirks and a duplicated term prevent a perfect score, but the text is highly readable and conveys the technical concepts correctly. The translator has done a solid job adapting a technical podcast script for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 17/20, Fluency 16/20, Terminology 18/20, Contextual Adaptation 17/20, Information Completeness 20/20. Total 88/100.\n\nRecommendations: smooth out the duplicated “(anclaje)”, replace “una cantidad considerablemente menor” with “una cantidad mucho menor”, and consider a slightly less colloquial exclamation for a formal podcast tone."
