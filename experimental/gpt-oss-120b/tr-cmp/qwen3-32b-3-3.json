  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logical and the concepts are explained clearly. A few sentences feel slightly literal (e.g., “Usted lo tiene claro”), but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, but there are occasional awkward phrases such as “Usted lo tiene claro”, the retention of the English term “cheat sheet”, and the hyphenated “aprendizaje‑en‑contexto”. These minor issues keep it from being completely smooth.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, ventana de contexto, anclaje, grounding, etc. Consistency is good, though the English loan‑word “cheat sheet” is left untranslated, which could be replaced by “hoja de trucos” for full Spanish terminology.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are adapted appropriately (e.g., “consultor” instead of “consultant”), and the explanations are suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All relevant information from the French source is retained. No key points are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original. Minor lexical differences (e.g., “memorización a corto plazo” vs. “bachotage”) do not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and faithful, conveying the technical content clearly. It could be improved by smoothing a few literal constructions and fully localizing some English loanwords, but it remains highly usable for Spanish listeners of the podcast.\nFinal average score: 17/20."
