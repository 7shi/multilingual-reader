  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained clearly. Some sentences are long, but they remain comprehensible. Minor typographic issues (extra spaces before punctuation) do not hinder understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural to a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and the style matches a podcast dialogue. There are a few awkward spots (e.g., \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje automático contextualizado\", punctuation spacing, and inconsistent use of the podcast name). These imperfections keep the fluency just below perfect.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\". The only notable inconsistency is the switch from \"ajuste fino\" earlier to \"afianzamiento\" later, a term that is not commonly used for fine‑tuning in Spanish. Otherwise terminology is consistent and appropriate for the intended audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using familiar phrasing and cultural references. The explanatory analogies are preserved and clear. The only lapse is the mixed use of the podcast name – \"Tecnología Flash\" at the start and \"Tech Éclair\" at the end – which slightly disrupts the contextual consistency.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the logical flow is maintained. The brand‑name inconsistency is a minor loss of information but does not affect the substantive content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical explanations clearly and retains the conversational tone of the podcast. Minor issues – inconsistent podcast naming, a rare term switch for \"fine‑tuning\", and small punctuation quirks – keep it from being flawless, but the overall message is preserved accurately and naturally.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17.6/20, indicating a strong translation with room for slight refinement."
