  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the original structure, allowing readers to grasp the main ideas. However, frequent punctuation errors (missing closing exclamation marks, misplaced commas) and occasional awkward phrasing interrupt the flow and require extra effort from the reader.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural expressions and register shifts (e.g., mixing formal \"Usted\" with informal \"¡Hola!\", using \"encaje\" for \"grounding\", literal English insertions like \"begins\", \"opens\"). These make the language feel stilted and not idiomatic for native Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"ICL\" are correctly rendered. The main flaw is the mistranslation of \"grounding\" as \"encaje\" (the correct term would be \"anclaje\" or keep \"grounding\"). Consistency is otherwise acceptable.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally preserves the podcast tone and the original intent. Nevertheless, the inconsistent level of formality and some culturally odd word choices (e.g., \"encaje\") reduce the natural adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present; no significant ideas are omitted. Minor issues such as occasional missing words or slight mistranslations do not affect the core information, but they introduce a small amount of redundancy and noise.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the essential content of the original French podcast and includes most of the technical explanations. However, it suffers from numerous punctuation mistakes, inconsistent register, and a few inaccurate term translations that affect fluency and readability. A thorough proofreading and careful handling of key technical terms would raise the quality substantially.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 67/100."
