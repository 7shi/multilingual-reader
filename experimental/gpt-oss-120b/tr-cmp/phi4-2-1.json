    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the concepts are explained clearly. Sentences are generally easy to follow, and the podcast style is maintained. A few long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for native speakers. Most phrasing is idiomatic, though there are minor awkward spots (e.g., \"expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo de la IA, o 'contexto'\" and the inconsistent acronym AIC vs ICL). These do not hinder understanding but slightly reduce fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well handled: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, anclaje, ventana de contexto, etc. The choice of \"ajuste fino\" for fine‑tuning and \"anclaje\" for grounding is appropriate. The switch from ICL to AIC is acceptable but a brief note could have clarified the change.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original tone to Spanish, using informal \"tú\" which fits a podcast audience. Cultural references are preserved and examples (consultor, bicicleta) resonate with Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the original ideas, examples, and distinctions between pre‑entrenamiento, afinado y aprendizaje en contexto are retained. No essential information is omitted; only minor stylistic differences appear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains readable and mostly natural, and respects the podcast’s informal tone. Minor inconsistencies in acronym usage and a couple of slightly clunky phrases prevent a perfect score, but they do not affect the overall effectiveness of the translation.\n\nStrengths: clear terminology, faithful rendering of concepts, good adaptation to the target audience.\nAreas for improvement: ensure consistent use of acronyms (ICL vs AIC) and refine a few longer sentences for smoother flow.\n\nThe translation would be readily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners familiar with AI topics and serves the original’s educational purpose well.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18/20."
