  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the main ideas, but the presence of stray braces, stray numbers (\"4.\"), and mismatched quotation marks breaks the flow. Some sentences are overly long or abruptly truncated, making it harder for a Spanish‑speaking reader to follow without re‑reading.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The wording is generally natural (e.g., \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana contextual\"), yet occasional awkward constructions (\"Ustedes lo han entendido todo\", \"Así, su memoria es limitada a esta conversación\") and the inconsistent opening greeting (\"¡Bienvenidos! Y bienvenido a\") detract from smoothness.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje contextual (ICL), anclaje/grounding, etc. The only minor issue is the choice of \"ventana contextual\" instead of the more common \"ventana de contexto\", but the meaning is clear and the terminology is used consistently.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the podcast tone and explains concepts for a general audience, but there is an inconsistency in the podcast name (\"TecnoLuz\" vs. \"Tech Éclair\" at the end) and a few culturally neutral phrases that could be smoother. Overall the intent is preserved.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all content from the original script is present, but several fragments are cut off or followed by stray characters, which may cause loss of nuance (e.g., the closing line of Luc about the crucial point). No major concepts are omitted, but the formatting errors reduce completeness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the substance of the original French podcast and uses appropriate technical vocabulary. However, formatting artifacts, occasional awkward phrasing, and minor inconsistencies (especially the podcast name) lower the overall readability and fluency. With cleanup of stray symbols and some stylistic polishing, the translation would be solid.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14/20.\n\nScore: 14"
