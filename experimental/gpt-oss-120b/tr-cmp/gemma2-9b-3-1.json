  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. Sentences are a bit long in places, but they remain understandable. Minor hiccups such as the use of “el afianzamiento” for fine‑tuning make the flow slightly less smooth.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most of the script. There are occasional awkward phrasings (e.g., “una forma astuta de aprendizaje automático contextualizado”, “el afianzamiento”) that a native speaker would likely rephrase, but overall the language is fluid.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly preserved (preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje). The choice of “afianzamiento” for fine‑tuning is non‑standard and may confuse readers; consistency is kept but a more common term would be preferable.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent, tone and podcast‑style delivery. Cultural adaptation is adequate; retaining the name “Tech Éclair” is acceptable. The only drawback is the occasional literal translation that sounds a bit foreign to Spanish‑speaking audiences.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is present. No important details are omitted, and the supplemental explanations (e.g., how the “Memoria” feature works) are retained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the content accurately and is mostly readable and natural. The main weaknesses lie in the choice of a few non‑standard technical terms (especially “afianzamiento”) and occasional clunky phrasing. With minor lexical adjustments, the text would be fully fluent and clearer for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\nStrengths: completeness, correct handling of most terminology, clear exposition of concepts. Areas for improvement: replace uncommon translations of fine‑tuning, smooth out some long sentences, and ensure all technical jargon matches common Spanish usage.\n\nScore breakdown: 16 (readability) + 15 (fluency) + 14 (terminology) + 17 (contextual adaptation) + 20 (information completeness) = 82/100.\n\nOverall rating: 4.1/5 – a solid translation that needs only modest polishing."
