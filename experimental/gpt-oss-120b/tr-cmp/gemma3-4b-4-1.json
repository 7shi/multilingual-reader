  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is riddled with broken sentences, stray punctuation, and leftover fragments from the original French (e.g., “Exactamente. Y este aprendizaje comienza con un proceso llamado el pre‑entrenamiento.”). Many lines are incoherent or abruptly cut, making it hard for a reader to follow the dialogue. The logical flow of the conversation is frequently lost, so comprehension is significantly impaired.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains numerous unnatural constructions (e.g., \"el aprendizaje previo\" instead of \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"el aprendizaje en contexto\" mixed with English acronyms, and literal word‑by‑word renderings like \"ancrage\" kept in parentheses). There are also duplicated symbols, stray braces, and missing verbs that make the prose sound robotic and fragmented rather than natural Spanish.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"transfer learning\", \"in‑context learning (ICL)\" and \"grounding\" are either mistranslated, left in French, or inconsistently rendered (e.g., \"optimización\" for \"fine‑tuning\" is acceptable, but later the term \"ancrage\" is not translated). The inconsistency confuses the reader and detracts from technical clarity.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original podcast tone (informal, conversational) is largely preserved, but many cultural or idiomatic adjustments are missing. Moreover, the translation includes many formatting artefacts (brackets, extra quotes) that distract from the intended message, reducing its effectiveness for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original script are omitted or garbled (e.g., the closing remarks, some explanatory sentences, and the final “Merci de nous avoir écoutés”). Several sentences are cut off mid‑thought, and the translation adds stray symbols that obscure meaning. Consequently, the Spanish version fails to convey the full content of the French source.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is heavily flawed. While the overall structure of a dialogue between Camille and Luc is recognizable, the text suffers from severe syntactic errors, untranslated fragments, inconsistent terminology, and numerous formatting artefacts. These issues make the translation difficult to read, unnatural, and incomplete. A thorough re‑translation with careful editing is required to achieve a clear, fluent, and accurate Spanish version suitable for podcast listeners.\n\nScore: 6/20 (average of the five criteria)."
