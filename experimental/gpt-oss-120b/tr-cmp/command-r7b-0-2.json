  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is understandable and follows the original structure, so a reader can grasp the discussion. However, the pervasive use of opening exclamation marks, occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenidos a…”, “¡Es una truco, entonces?”) and a few typographical errors (missing accent, “en só mismo”) interrupt the flow and require extra effort.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Native‑speaker fluency is compromised by many unnatural constructions, misspellings (\"ancoraje\" instead of \"anclaje\", \"en só mismo\" instead of \"en sí mismo\"), and inconsistent punctuation. The translation sounds more like a literal, over‑exclaimed script than natural spoken Spanish.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly (preentrenamiento, afinamiento, transferencia, ventana de contexto). Yet some choices are imprecise: \"In‑Context Learning\" becomes \"Aprendizaje en Contexto Interno\" (redundant), \"grounding\" is misspelled, and \"fine‑tuning\" is sometimes called \"el afinar\". Consistency suffers slightly.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent and explanatory tone are preserved, and the translation does not introduce cultural mismatches. The main drawback is the over‑use of exclamation marks, which changes the register and makes the dialogue feel overly enthusiastic for a technical podcast.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No substantial information is omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full content and technical ideas, but it is marred by numerous stylistic, orthographic, and grammatical issues that reduce its naturalness and readability. A careful edit to remove excessive exclamation marks, correct misspellings, and choose more idiomatic phrasing would raise the quality considerably.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14.2 ≈ 14/20."
