  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is often understandable, but many sentences are truncated or contain leftover French words (e.g., “Et yo soy Luc.”). Some important connective words are missing, making the flow choppy. Errors like “ancraje” instead of “anclaje” also hinder comprehension. Overall, a native reader would have to work to piece together the meaning.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several awkward constructions and mixing of languages (“Et yo soy Luc.”, “‘Mémoire’”). The translation sometimes omits verbs or particles, leading to unnatural phrasing. Vocabulary choices are generally adequate, but the lack of smoothness and occasional typos reduce naturalness.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “pré‑entraînement”, “fenêtre de contexte”, “In‑Context Learning” are correctly rendered as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”. However, some terms are mistranslated or misspelled (e.g., “ancraje” for “anclaje”, “especialización” for “afinage” without clarification). Consistency is mostly kept, but the errors lower the score.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally preserves the original intent and explains the concepts, but the omission of entire lines (e.g., Luc’s “Exactement.”) and the mixed‑language fragments reduce the effectiveness of the adaptation. Cultural adaptation is fine, but the missing content hurts the overall conveyance.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several sentences from the original are omitted or heavily shortened, most notably Luc’s introductory affirmation and parts of the dialogue about fine‑tuning. Consequently, some explanatory details are lost, and the narrative is less complete than the source.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the main ideas but suffers from serious omissions, language mixing, typographical errors, and occasional mistranslations of technical terms. While a reader could grasp the general discussion, the quality is far below a professional, polished translation. Significant revision is needed to reach an acceptable standard for native Spanish speakers.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 10/20."
