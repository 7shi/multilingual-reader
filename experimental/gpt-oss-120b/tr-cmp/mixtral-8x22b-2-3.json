  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow; sentences are not overly long and the podcast dialogue format is preserved. However, a few constructions (e.g., the erroneous expansion of ICL, occasional clunky phrasing) may cause brief pauses for the reader.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation reads naturally, but there are several awkward expressions: \"Inteligencia Computacional Linguística\" for ICL, \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotage\" (literal translation of a French slang), and inconsistent use of the podcast name at the end. These reduce the overall smoothness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as «pre‑entrenamiento», «afinación», «aprendizaje por transferencia», «ventana de contexto» and «anclaje» are correctly rendered. The main flaw is the mistranslation of the acronym ICL, which is expanded incorrectly, and the occasional mixing of French terms. Otherwise terminology is consistent and appropriate for a general‑audience podcast.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the conversational tone to Spanish well and respects the podcast style. Minor cultural inconsistencies appear (e.g., the podcast name switches back to \"Tech Éclair\" at the close). The inaccurate ICL expansion also shows a lack of contextual adaptation for that concept.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the original French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No major content is omitted, though the wrong ICL definition slightly distorts the information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation conveys the original content accurately and maintains the podcast’s educational tone. Readability and completeness are strong, but fluency and terminology suffer from a few mistranslations and awkward phrasing, most notably the incorrect expansion of the ICL acronym and the inconsistent podcast naming. A revised version should correct these issues to achieve a more natural and precise Spanish rendering.\n\nScore (sum of the five criteria): 79/100"
