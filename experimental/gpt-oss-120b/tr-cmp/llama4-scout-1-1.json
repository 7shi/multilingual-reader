  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is hard to follow because several lines are left in French (e.g., “Telle est la réalité de l'ICL…”, “C'est la manière idéale…”) and a placeholder line “Spanish translation of the provided French text” appears. The mix of formal “usted” and informal “tú” pronouns, as well as occasional abrupt jumps, makes the flow disjointed. A reader would need to stop and guess missing parts, lowering overall comprehensibility.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While many sentences are grammatically correct, the translation contains many unnatural constructions (“Usted lo ha entendido todo”, “Es una forma astuta de aprendizaje en un contexto automatizado”), literal renderings of French idioms, and inconsistent register. The presence of untranslated French fragments further breaks the natural flow, resulting in a text that does not feel fully native.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, aprendizaje en contexto) are correctly rendered. However, some terms are left in English or French (e.g., “grounding”, “ancrage” is used but not explained, and French sentences remain). The handling is mostly consistent but not perfect.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator largely preserves the original intent, but the mixed language fragments, the literal translation of certain French jokes, and the insertion of meta‑comments (“Spanish translation of the provided French text”) reduce cultural appropriateness. The shift between formal and informal address also shows a lack of adaptation to the target audience.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Important portions of the dialogue are missing or left in French, notably the explanation of the difference between ICL and fine‑tuning that appears in French. The placeholder line and untranslated sections cause loss of information. Conversely, no extra, unnecessary content is added, but the omissions are significant.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures many of the core technical concepts but suffers from serious quality issues. Untranslated French passages, inconsistent pronoun usage, occasional literal translations, and a placeholder line break the readability and fluency. Terminology is mostly accurate, yet the overall presentation feels fragmented and incomplete, making the Spanish version unsuitable for a smooth listening experience without substantial revision."
