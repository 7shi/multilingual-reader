  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logical and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor issues such as mixed use of “Ustedes” and “tú” and a couple of punctuation quirks do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, but there are a few awkward phrases (e.g., “Ustedes lo han entendido todo”, “una forma astuta de aprendizaje automático en contexto”, “afinamiento” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”). These reduce the smoothness slightly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding, etc. The choice of “afinamiento” is acceptable, and English acronyms are retained with explanations, preserving precision.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast conversation. Cultural references are appropriate for Spanish‑speaking audiences, though the occasional shift between formal and informal address is a minor inconsistency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original script is present; no ideas are omitted or added unnecessarily. The content remains concise and faithful to the source.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is very good. It conveys the technical discussion clearly and keeps the conversational style of the podcast. Minor fluency hiccups and slight inconsistencies in register prevent a perfect score, but the terminology and completeness are strong points. The text would be easily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners interested in AI concepts.\n\nScore: 17/20 (average of the five criteria)."
