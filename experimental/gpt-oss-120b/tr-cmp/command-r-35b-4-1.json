    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. However, some sentences are overly long or contain literal translations that make the flow a bit cumbersome (e.g., “cantidad masiva de simples datos” or the repeated explanations of “afinamiento”). These minor issues slightly reduce the smoothness for a reader unfamiliar with the original French.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several spots where the wording sounds unnatural to native speakers: “ventana contextual” (more common is “ventana de contexto”), “una velocidad increíble e impresionante” (redundant), and the presence of English terms like “Tech Flash” at the end. Some phrasing is repetitive, and the translation sometimes mirrors the French structure too closely, which feels stilted in Spanish. Overall it is understandable but not fully idiomatic.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is mostly handled correctly. Terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning”, “transfer learning”, “in‑context learning (ICL)”, “memoria a corto plazo” and “anclaje (grounding)” are appropriate and consistent. A couple of minor choices could be refined (e.g., “ventana contextual” vs. the more usual “ventana de contexto”), but the terminology does not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the podcast’s informal, conversational tone and adapts cultural references well (e.g., “Tecnología Relámpago” for “Tech Éclair”). The only notable lapse is the leftover English title “Tech Flash” at the conclusion, which breaks the Spanish immersion. Apart from that, the adaptation respects the target audience’s expectations.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key points from the original French script are retained. No major ideas or examples are omitted, and the dialogue structure is preserved. Minor redundancies appear, but they do not cause loss of information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and maintains the educational, conversational style of the podcast. While the technical terms are well rendered and the information is complete, the text suffers from occasional awkward phrasing and a few untranslated English fragments that affect naturalness. With some polishing of idiomatic expressions and removal of residual English, the translation would reach a higher level of fluency.\nOverall rating: 16/20."
