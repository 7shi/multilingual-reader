  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are clear. Minor issues such as the duplicated \"Camille: Camille:\" label do not affect comprehension, but a few long sentences could be split for smoother reading.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few literal renderings that feel slightly awkward to native speakers (e.g., \"Mire:\" instead of \"Vea:\" or \"Observe\", and the very long consultant analogy). The duplication error and occasional overly formal phrasing reduce fluency slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (aprendizaje en contexto)\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are all translated appropriately and used consistently. The translator kept the English abbreviations where needed, which aids understanding for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts expressions to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Cultural references are neutral, and the educational tone is maintained. The only notable flaw is the literal \"Mire:\" and the duplicate speaker label, which are minor lapses in adaptation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No essential points are omitted, and the flow of the conversation is kept intact. Redundancies are minimal, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, this is a high‑quality translation. It conveys the technical concepts accurately and remains comprehensible for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic awkwardness, a duplicated speaker tag, and a few overly literal phrases prevent it from being perfect, but the translation is functionally solid and faithful to the source.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17 out of 20."
