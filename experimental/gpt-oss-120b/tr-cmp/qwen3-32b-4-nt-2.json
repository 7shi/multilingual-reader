  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the dialogue format is preserved, allowing the listener to grasp the concepts without difficulty. A few minor issues (e.g., \"Tecnología Claro\" instead of a more idiomatic \"Tecnología Clara\") slightly affect smoothness, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, using appropriate colloquial and formal registers where needed. Some phrases feel overly literal (“Tiene usted toda la razón”, “el modelo en sí no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus conversaciones”), which a native speaker might phrase differently, but overall the flow is good and there are no glaring grammatical errors.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled expertly. Core terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL) and \"grounding\" are either translated accurately or kept in English with a clear Spanish explanation. Consistency is maintained throughout, and the occasional capitalisation difference does not affect understanding.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately. The analogy of a consultant, the discussion of memory features, and the podcast framing are all preserved. The only slight mismatch is the podcast title \"Tech Éclair\" rendered as \"Iluminación Tecnológica\" only at the very end, which could cause a minor inconsistency, but overall the adaptation feels suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the logical progression of the conversation is intact. Minor redundancies (e.g., repeated clarification of ICL) are acceptable and do not dilute the content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality, conveying the technical nuances of AI pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning with clarity and natural Spanish expression. Minor lexical choices and a couple of stylistic inconsistencies prevent a perfect score, but the text remains comprehensible, accurate, and engaging for the target audience.\nOverall score: 18/20."
