    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is riddled with formatting glitches (e.g., duplicated speaker labels, stray quotation marks, JSON‑like notes) and inconsistent punctuation. Sentences are often broken or contain leftover English fragments, which forces the reader to pause and re‑interpret. While the overall storyline can still be followed, the flow is heavily disrupted, making comprehension harder than in the original.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural: \"el afinamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\", \"la gran pregunta para cualquiera que use estas herramientas es\" (awkward word order), and literal translations such as \"bachotage\" that are not idiomatic in Spanish. There are also typographical errors (missing accents, inconsistent capitalization) and occasional English words left in the text. These issues reduce the naturalness of the translation.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely identified correctly (e.g., \"preentrenamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"memoria a corto plazo\"). However, the translator mixes French‑style terms (\"afinaje\") with Spanish alternatives, sometimes leaves English acronyms without explanation, and occasionally fails to provide the expected Spanish equivalents (e.g., \"fine‑tuning\" would be better rendered as \"ajuste fino\"). Consistency is therefore moderate.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation tries to keep the informal podcast tone, but cultural adaptation is weak. Phrases such as \"¡Hola y bienvenido/a!\" feel forced, and the inclusion of meta‑commentary about translation choices (the long analytical paragraph) is inappropriate for a podcast script. Some idiomatic Spanish equivalents are missing, making the text feel foreign to a native audience.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The core ideas of the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. Nevertheless, the translation adds superfluous meta‑information, repeats speaker tags, and omits a few connector sentences that smooth the dialogue in the French version. Hence the information is largely complete but not as concise or clean as it should be.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the main concepts of the French podcast but suffers from serious quality issues. Formatting glitches, inconsistent terminology, and awkward phrasing hinder readability and fluency. Technical vocabulary is mostly correct but not consistently applied, and cultural adaptation is limited. To be suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience, the text needs a thorough rewrite: clean up the speaker labels, remove the translation‑analysis insert, choose more idiomatic Spanish terms (e.g., \"ajuste fino\" instead of \"afinaje\"), correct punctuation and accentuation, and smooth out the conversational flow. With those revisions the content could become a clear, natural, and accurate Spanish version of the original episode.\n\nScore Summary:\n- Readability: 8/20\n- Fluency: 7/20\n- Terminology: 12/20\n- Contextual Adaptation: 9/20\n- Information Completeness: 10/20"
