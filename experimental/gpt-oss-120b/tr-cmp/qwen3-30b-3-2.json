  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the ideas are clearly expressed. Sentence structures are logical, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑specialist can understand. Minor hiccups (e.g., occasional long sentences) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation reads naturally, but a few word choices sound slightly forced (e.g., “refinamiento” for fine‑tuning, “una forma astuta” instead of “ingeniosa”). The use of quotation marks « » and occasional literal renderings of English terms (prompt, ICL) are acceptable for a tech‑savvy audience but could be smoother.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely correct: preentrenamiento, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje por transferencia, anclaje, etc. The main inconsistency is the translation of fine‑tuning as “refinamiento”; the more common term is “ajuste fino”. The term “prompt” is left untranslated, which is acceptable but could be clarified.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast tone and intent, adapts the title to “Tech Relámpago”, and uses culturally appropriate Spanish phrasing. The conversational style is kept, and the explanations are tailored to Spanish‑speaking listeners without losing the original nuance.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All original information is retained; no sentences or ideas are omitted. The translation includes every example and analogy present in the French source, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content clearly. While the language is generally fluent and the ideas are well adapted, a few terminology choices (especially “refinamiento”) and occasional literal renderings prevent it from being perfectly natural. Minor stylistic tweaks would raise the fluency and terminology scores, but the overall quality is high and the listener would understand the podcast without difficulty.\nOverall score (out of 100): 86/100."
