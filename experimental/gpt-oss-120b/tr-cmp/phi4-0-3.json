  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clearly expressed. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., “las nuevas conocimientos”, “dársela un conocimiento”) slightly hinder smooth reading, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly sounds natural, but there are several awkward constructions (“Vea, no enseñaría…”, “cuando refinás un modelo” with voseo, “dársela”) and occasional word‑choice issues that a native speaker would avoid. Overall it is understandable but not completely fluent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is handled well: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, ventana de contexto, anclaje, grounding, prompt, etc. Terms are consistent and appropriate for a general‑audience podcast. Minor inconsistency (keeping some English words) is acceptable in this context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal, conversational tone of the podcast and adapts cultural references appropriately. A few phrasing choices could be more idiomatic, but the original intent and register are retained.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas from the original French script are present; no significant information is omitted. Small typographical errors do not affect the conveyed content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical concepts clearly to a Spanish‑speaking audience. While readability and completeness are strong, fluency suffers from occasional clumsy phrasing and minor grammatical errors. Technical terminology is accurate and consistent, and the adaptation respects the original tone. With a few stylistic tweaks, the text would read like a native‑produced podcast script."
