  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the logical flow of the original French dialogue. Most sentences convey the ideas clearly, and the technical concepts are explained in simple terms. However, a few constructions are slightly clunky (e.g., “montas en silla” instead of “te subes a la bicicleta”) and the mix of formal \"usted\" with informal tone can momentarily confuse the reader.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward phrases that a native speaker would not use: \"La competencia está anclada\", \"no necesitas que te recuerden las leyes del equilibrio cada vez que montas en silla\", and occasional overly literal renderings such as \"preentrenamiento\" (acceptable but less common than \"pre‑entrenamiento\"). These issues lower the overall smoothness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms like \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are correctly translated and consistently used throughout. Minor inconsistencies (e.g., mixing \"prompt\" with the Spanish word \"indicación\") do not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original content to a Spanish‑speaking audience appropriately. Metaphors such as \"consultor brillante\" work well, and cultural references are neutral, making the text accessible. A few idiomatic choices could be refined (e.g., \"consultor temporal\" vs. \"consultor temporal\" is fine, but \"montas en silla\" is culturally odd). Overall, the intent and tone are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No sentences or ideas have been omitted, and the translation does not introduce unrelated content. Redundancies are minimal and the length mirrors the original.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and retains the educational tone. Technical concepts are well rendered, and the dialogue remains faithful to the source. The main areas for improvement are fluency and naturalness of expression; smoothing out awkward phrasing and ensuring consistent register would raise the quality further. Nonetheless, the text is clear, complete, and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
