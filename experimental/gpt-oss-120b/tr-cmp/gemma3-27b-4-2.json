    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are clear and the flow of ideas mirrors the original. A few wording choices (e.g., “pre‑capacitación” for “pré‑entraînement”) are slightly awkward but do not hinder comprehension. Overall, a French‑speaking audience would understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most of the text, but there are occasional clunky constructions: “aprendizaje en contexto, o aprendizaje en contexto (In‑Context Learning)”, the redundancy of “ventana contextual”, and the use of “optimización” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”. These minor issues prevent a completely smooth native‑speaker experience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well handled: “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana contextual”, “aprendizaje en contexto (In‑Context Learning)”, and “anclaje” are appropriate. However, “optimización” is not the standard translation for “fine‑tuning”, which should be “ajuste fino” or “fine‑tuning”. The inconsistency lowers the precision of the terminology.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the podcast title to “Tech al Instante”, which fits Spanish‑language branding. The tone remains conversational and the cultural references stay relevant. Minor lexical choices (e.g., “pre‑capacitación”) are slightly odd but do not affect the overall intent. The adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and analogies from the original script are present. No significant information is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary material. The content is complete and faithful to the source.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast’s content accurately and is largely readable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. While most technical concepts are correctly rendered, a few terminology choices (especially ‘optimización’ for fine‑tuning) and occasional awkward phrasing prevent it from being perfectly natural. Overall, it is a solid translation that could be polished further for native fluency and precise technical language.\n\nOverall score (sum of the five criteria): 81/100."
