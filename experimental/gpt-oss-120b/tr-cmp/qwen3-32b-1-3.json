  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows a logical flow. Most sentences convey the original ideas clearly, and complex concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can follow. Minor issues such as the unchanged “#black boxes” tag and occasional punctuation quirks do not seriously hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural to native speakers: “¿Ya he oído este término?” (should be “¿Ya he escuchado…?”), “cramar para un examen” (non‑idiomatic), and the abrupt inclusion of “#black boxes”. There are also occasional awkward word orders and a mistaken acronym “AIC” instead of “ICL”. These reduce the overall smoothness of the translation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “anclaje” are appropriate. However, the acronym ICL is incorrectly rendered as “AIC”, and the French term “affinage” is translated only as “afinamiento” without a brief clarification. The English tag “#black boxes” is left untranslated, which is a missed opportunity for consistency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, adapting the pedagogical analogies to Spanish fairly well. Nevertheless, some idiomatic choices (e.g., “cramar”) feel out of place, and the untranslated English tag may confuse Spanish‑speaking listeners. Overall, cultural adaptation is adequate but not optimal.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the substantive information from the French script is present. No major sections are omitted, and the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, and memory features remain intact. The only minor loss is the mis‑rendered acronym and the unchanged English hashtag, which do not affect core content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content and the conversational style of the podcast quite well. It is readable and mostly complete, but it suffers from a few unnatural phrasings, an incorrect acronym, and some untranslated elements that detract from fluency and terminology precision. With minor revisions—especially fixing the ICL/AIC mistake, replacing non‑idiomatic expressions, and translating the “#black boxes” tag—the text would reach a higher level of naturalness and technical consistency.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
