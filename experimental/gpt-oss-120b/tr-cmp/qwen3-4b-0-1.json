    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clear. Most sentences convey the original meaning, and complex concepts are explained in a comprehensible way. Minor issues such as the preposition error \"bienvenido en\" and a few awkward phrasings slightly hinder smooth reading, but they do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural constructions for native speakers (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenido en\", mixed use of \"Usted\" in an informal podcast, spacing before punctuation, and literal renderings like \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automático\"). These make the text feel a bit stilted, although the overall flow is acceptable.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"grounding\" rendered as \"anclaje\", etc. The terminology is consistent throughout and appropriate for the intended audience. No critical term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and purpose, but it retains a formal register that does not match the conversational tone of a podcast. Some phrases could be adapted more naturally to Spanish‑speaking listeners (e.g., using \"tú\" instead of \"Usted\"). Cultural idioms are largely absent, but the core message remains intact.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the supplemental explanations (e.g., clarifying \"prompt\") are retained. Minor punctuation differences do not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of preserving the technical content and overall structure of the original podcast script. It is clear and mostly accurate, but the language sometimes feels overly literal and formal for a podcast setting, leading to occasional awkwardness. Improving the register and smoothing out a few grammatical slips would raise the fluency and readability scores significantly.\nOverall score: 82/100."
