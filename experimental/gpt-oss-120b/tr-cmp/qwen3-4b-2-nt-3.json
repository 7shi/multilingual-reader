  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor typographical issues (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en” instead of “¡Hola y bienvenidos a”) and a few long sentences slightly affect flow, but a native reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward constructions (“El aprendizaje en contexto, es el estudio superficial”, “Se percibe que realmente comienzan a recordar”) and occasional missing opening exclamation marks. Vocabulary is appropriate, yet the phrasing could be smoother in places.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly rendered (preentrenamiento, ventana de contexto, ICL). However, the translation mixes languages for some terms (e.g., keeps “grounding” in English, uses “afinación” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”), which can cause inconsistency for a technically‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and purpose of the original podcast script are well conveyed. Cultural adaptation is mostly adequate, though a few expressions feel literal (“¡Hola y bienvenido en”) and could be refined for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Overall, the adaptation maintains the original tone and educational aim.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present; no major ideas are omitted. The translation keeps the examples, analogies, and the distinction between fine‑tuning and in‑context learning intact. Minor redundancies are present but do not affect completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content of the podcast into Spanish. It is readable and mostly fluent, with correct terminology for the most part. Minor linguistic slips and inconsistent handling of a few technical terms prevent it from being fully natural, but the overall message is clear and complete. With a few stylistic revisions, the text would reach a near‑native level of polish.\nOverall score (sum of the five criteria): 78/100."
