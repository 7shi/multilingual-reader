  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the concepts are explained clearly. Sentences are not overly long, and the dialogue format is preserved, making it easy for a Spanish‑speaking audience to follow. Minor punctuation quirks (use of « ») do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but a few expressions feel slightly forced (e.g., \"es una forma astuta de aprendizaje contextual automático\" and the mix of \"afinamiento\" vs. the more common \"ajuste fino\"). These do not break understanding but reduce native‑speaker smoothness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". The only inconsistency is the occasional switch between \"afinamiento\" and \"ajuste fino\", which could be unified, but the meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately. The style fits a podcast script in Spanish, using familiar phrasing and maintaining the conversational tone.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No key details are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original, preserving the logical progression of ideas.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality: it conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the engaging podcast dialogue, and is generally easy to understand for Spanish speakers. Minor wording choices and term consistency issues prevent a perfect score, but they are not serious enough to affect overall comprehension.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.4/20, rounded to 18/20."
