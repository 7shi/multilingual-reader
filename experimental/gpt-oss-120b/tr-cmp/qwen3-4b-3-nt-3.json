  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is generally understandable and the ideas are conveyed clearly. However, a few awkward phrasings (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en”, “informaciones”) slightly impede smooth reading for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several grammatical slips and unnatural word choices: inconsistent use of “usted/tú”, verb‑agreement errors (\"cuando usted afinan\", \"las nuevas conocimientos\"), and odd neologisms such as “apresuramiento” and “precalentamiento”. These reduce the natural feel of the text.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well‑handled – preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL – and the English acronym is kept. Minor issues arise with leaving “prompt” untranslated and the odd translation of “c‑learning” concepts, but overall the terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the podcast format and maintains the original tone. Some expressions, however, feel too literal (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en”, “precalentamiento”), and a few cultural nuances could be refined to sound more idiomatic for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present; no major ideas are omitted or distorted. The translation stays faithful to the original content while preserving the logical flow of the dialogue.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in transmitting the core concepts of the podcast and retains most of the technical content. Nevertheless, it suffers from several grammatical errors, inconsistent pronoun usage, and a handful of unnatural lexical choices that affect fluency and readability. A careful proofreading and some idiomatic adjustments would bring it to a much higher quality level.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
