  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logical and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, etc.) are clear. A few sentences are long, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation sounds natural, but there are several awkward phrasings: \"gran expansión de la memoria a corto plazo de la IA, o 'contexto de ventana'\" (the usual term is *ventana de contexto*), \"partes de un contexto vacío\" (should be *parte*), and the inconsistent gender agreement in a few places. These issues prevent the text from being completely fluid.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, grounding). However, the abbreviation ICL is incorrectly expanded as *Lenguaje de Comando Integrado* instead of *Aprendizaje en Contexto* (In‑Context Learning). The phrase \"contexto de ventana\" is also a non‑standard translation. These inaccuracies lower the score.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style, making the content appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral and the examples remain relevant. The only drawback is the mistaken ICL expansion, which could confuse readers familiar with the term.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the ideas, examples, and analogies from the French original are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original message accurately and is easy to understand. It succeeds in keeping the educational tone and includes all relevant details. The main weaknesses are a few non‑idiomatic expressions and a mis‑translation of the ICL acronym, which affect technical precision and fluency. With minor revisions to those points, the translation would be of high quality.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 17/20, Fluency 14/20, Terminology 13/20, Contextual Adaptation 16/20, Information Completeness 18/20. Total 78/100.\n\nRecommendation: revise the ICL expansion, use the standard term *ventana de contexto*, and smooth out the few grammatical slips.\n\nScore: 78/100"
