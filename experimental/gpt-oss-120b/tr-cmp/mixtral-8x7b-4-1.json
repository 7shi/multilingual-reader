  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the main ideas, but frequent typographical glitches (e.g., stray \"}'', missing accent marks, leftover French words like « université »), and occasional grammatical slips make the text harder to follow for a native Spanish reader. The overall flow is interrupted by these errors, reducing comprehension.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several unnatural constructions (e.g., \"Elimina todo\" for \"Olvida todo\", \"ancraje\" instead of \"anclaje\", inconsistent use of the podcast name). Some sentences feel literal or stilted, and punctuation is occasionally off. While a Spanish‑speaking audience can understand the gist, the language does not read smoothly.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as « preentrenamiento », « ajuste fino », « aprendizaje por transferencia », and « aprendizaje en contexto » are correctly rendered. However, the translation introduces occasional inaccuracies (e.g., \"ancraje\" for \"anclaje\", mixing English acronym ICL with a Spanish description) and does not maintain consistent naming for the podcast, which slightly harms terminology consistency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator generally preserves the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately, but the inconsistent rendering of the podcast title (\"Tecnología Iluminada\" vs. \"Tech Éclair\") and the presence of untranslated French words break the adaptation. The overall message is still clear, yet the occasional cultural mismatch lowers the score.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of memory features. Minor redundancies and the stray characters do not delete essential information, so completeness is relatively high.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the core content and most technical concepts, but it suffers from noticeable typographical and linguistic errors, inconsistent terminology, and occasional awkward phrasing. These issues affect readability and naturalness, making the text feel semi‑professional rather than polished. A careful proofread and harmonisation of the podcast name, as well as correction of the few mistranslations, would raise the quality substantially.\n\n**Overall score (average of criteria): 12/20**"
