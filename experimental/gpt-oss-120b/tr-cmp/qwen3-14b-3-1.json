  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning) are explained clearly. Minor typographic issues (extra spaces before punctuation, missing opening «¡» in one exclamation) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few constructions feel literal or slightly awkward (e.g., \"Lo entendieron todo\", \"una hoja de trucos\" kept as \"cheat sheet\", inconsistent use of accents). The overall flow is good, yet native speakers would likely re‑phrase some lines.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and the acronym ICL are preserved and correctly rendered. A couple of English words (\"prompt\", \"cheat sheet\") remain untranslated, which is acceptable for a tech‑savvy audience but slightly reduces consistency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent, tone and educational purpose. Cultural references are neutral and appropriate for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor stylistic choices (use of \"¡\" and some punctuation) could be improved, but they do not affect the message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is present. No sentences or key concepts are omitted, and the logical progression of the dialogue is intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the podcast script accurately and is generally clear and faithful to the source. Readability and completeness are strong, while fluency and terminology could be polished slightly by eliminating a few literal translations and ensuring consistent use of Spanish technical vocabulary. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a tech‑oriented audience."
