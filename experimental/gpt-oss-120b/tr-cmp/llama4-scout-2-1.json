  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the logical flow of the podcast dialogue is preserved. A few sentences are a bit long or overly literal (“es posible gracias a la expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo de la IA, o ventana de contexto”), but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are occasional awkward constructions (“Usted lo ha entendido todo”, “su área de trabajo temporal simplemente se ha vaciado”). The mix of formal “Usted” with a conversational podcast style creates a slight tonal mismatch. Vocabulary choices are appropriate, yet a few phrases could be smoother.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning (ajuste fino/afinamiento), aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, In‑Context Learning (ICL), grounding, etc. The translator keeps English acronyms in parentheses, which aids clarity. Minor inconsistency between “ajuste fino” and “afinamiento” could be unified, but overall the terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and maintains the explanatory tone of the podcast. The added parenthetical note about term usage is informative, though it breaks the flow of the dialogue. The use of “Usted” makes it slightly more formal than the original French, which used “vous”, but it does not distort the message. Cultural references are preserved and no inappropriate idioms appear.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version, including the nuanced discussion about memory features, the analogy of temporary vs permanent learning, and the concluding remarks. No essential content is omitted, and the added explanatory note does not add misinformation.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. It succeeds in preserving the structure and depth of the original podcast while using appropriate Spanish terminology. Minor fluency issues (some literal phrasing and tonal inconsistencies) and a slight lack of stylistic uniformity prevent it from being perfect, but the text is fully understandable and technically accurate.\n\nStrengths: accurate terminology, complete information transfer, clear explanations of complex concepts.\nAreas for improvement: smoother, more conversational language to match the podcast format, consistent use of either “ajuste fino” or “afinamiento”, and removal of editorial notes that interrupt dialogue flow.\n\nScore: 87/100"
