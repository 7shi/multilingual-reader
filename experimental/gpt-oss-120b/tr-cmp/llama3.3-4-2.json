  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but the frequent parenthetical editorial notes (e.g., \"or more natural translation could be…\") interrupt the flow. Some sentences are clunky (\"El aprendizaje en un contexto específico en acción\") and the occasional English word (\"prompt\") reduces smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural constructions and literal renderings that a native speaker would avoid. The presence of meta‑comments, mismatched verb tenses and odd phrasing (\"la IA no ha olvidado; a diferencia de los humanos…\") makes the dialogue sound artificial.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"transferencia\" and \"ventana de contexto\" are correctly kept. However, the expansion of the acronym ICL to \"Aprendizaje de Características Inteligentes\" is inaccurate (ICL = In‑Context Learning). The term \"prompt\" is left untranslated, and the handling of \"memoria\" feature is inconsistent, which lowers the technical precision.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator attempts to adapt some expressions to Spanish (e.g., offering alternative phrasings), but the inserted editorial suggestions break the conversational tone of a podcast. Cultural adaptation is minimal, and the added explanatory notes feel out of place for the target audience.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All main ideas from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the pseudo‑memory feature. Minor nuances are lost or muddled (e.g., the correct meaning of ICL), but no major content is omitted.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the essential concepts of the podcast, but its readability and naturalness are hampered by intrusive editorial remarks, some inaccurate technical expansions, and occasional awkward phrasing. A cleaner version that removes the meta‑comments, corrects the definition of ICL, and smooths the dialogue would significantly improve the quality.\n\nOverall, the work is functional but needs revision to reach a native‑like, professional standard.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 12/20."
