    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the dialogue format is preserved. Most sentences are clear, but there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en «Tech Éclair»” and “Cuando abres una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío”) that slightly hinder smooth comprehension for native readers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but occasional literal renderings and punctuation errors betray a non‑native feel. Phrases such as “¡Hola y bienvenido en” and “¡Hola y bienvenido en «Tech Éclair», el podcast…” are not idiomatic. Nevertheless, the overall flow is acceptable for a podcast script.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: preentrenamiento, afinación, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding, etc. The terms are consistently used and kept in quotes when the English word is retained, which helps the reader recognize the original jargon. No major mistranslations are found.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the informal, conversational tone of the original podcast. Cultural adaptation is mostly adequate, but some introductory phrases could be more natural in Spanish (“¡Hola y bienvenidos al podcast…”). The overall intent and humor are preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No key ideas, examples, or analogies are omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is intact. Minor punctuation differences do not affect content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and keeps the lively podcast atmosphere. Minor issues with naturalness and a few literal phrasings prevent it from being flawless, but the text is comprehensible and technically sound. A small polish of idiomatic expressions would bring it to a near‑perfect level.\nOverall score (out of 100): 83/100."
