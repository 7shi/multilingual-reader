  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and the dialogue flows logically. Most sentences are easy to understand, and complex concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) are explained in a way that a non‑expert can follow. Minor issues such as the typo \"crammar\" and the awkward phrase \"Aprendizaje Contextual Instruccional (ICL)\" slightly hinder smooth reading, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several unnatural or literal renderings. Examples include \"ventana de contexto\" (acceptable but less common than \"ventana de contexto\"), \"Aprendizaje Contextual Instruccional\" (an odd literal translation of ICL), and occasional clumsy constructions like \"El modelo en sí mismo no aprende y no evoluciona a partir de sus conversaciones. Lo hace mediante un mecanismo más inteligente para recuperar el contexto anterior.\" These affect the overall fluidity, though the text is still understandable to native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly well handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". However, the mistranslation of ICL and the typo \"crammar\" (instead of \"estudiar para un examen\") show inconsistency. The term \"memoria\" for the new feature is correctly kept. Overall, terminology is adequate but not perfect.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. It adapts the French conversational style to Spanish without losing the explanatory nature. Cultural references are neutral, and the speaker dynamics (Camille, Luc) are kept. Minor phrasing issues do not affect the conveyed message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and analogies from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue. The only drawback is the small typo, which does not constitute loss of information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content of the podcast episode into Spanish. It is largely readable and complete, with appropriate handling of most specialized vocabulary. The main weaknesses are a few literal translations (especially the ICL acronym), a typographical error, and some slightly stiff phrasing that reduces naturalness. With minor edits to correct the typo, refine the ICL term, and smooth out a few sentences, the translation would reach a near‑native level of fluency.\nOverall quality: good, but not flawless.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16.2 → rounded to 16 out of 20."
