  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the sentences flow logically, making the technical concepts understandable for the target audience. A few sentences are slightly clunky (e.g., “Usted lo ha entendido todo.”) but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally overall, but there are occasional awkward phrasing and inconsistent register (formal \"Usted\" versus the more conversational tone of the original). Minor grammatical oddities such as \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\" and the occasional literal translation of idioms slightly reduce naturalness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, anclaje, etc. The translator kept the terminology consistent and provided appropriate Spanish equivalents where needed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience, but the use of the formal \"Usted\" creates a slightly mismatched tone compared to the original informal podcast dialogue. Cultural references are preserved, and the overall intent is conveyed, though a more consistent informal register would improve adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No key points are omitted, and the explanations remain complete while avoiding unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the technical content effectively. Readability and terminology are strong points, while fluency and tone could be polished a bit to better match the conversational style of the original podcast. Minor adjustments to register and some phrasing would bring the translation to a higher level of naturalness."
