    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version contains many translator‑side notes, options, and meta‑comments (e.g., \"Improved translation (based on context...)\", \"Opción 1\", \"Nota clave\"). These interrupt the flow of the dialogue and make it difficult for a listener or reader to follow the podcast script as a coherent conversation.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Aside from the intrusive annotations, the Spanish sentences are generally grammatical, but the style is uneven. Some phrasing is literal (“la IA no almacena permanentemente”) while other parts sound forced or overly formal for a spoken podcast. The presence of bracketed English terms and duplicated variations (formal vs. informal) reduces naturalness.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"grounding\" are correctly rendered and consistently used. The occasional retention of English acronyms (ICL) is acceptable in a technical context.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent—a lively podcast dialogue—is diluted by the inclusion of translation‑guidance notes, multiple version suggestions, and inconsistent naming of the podcast (\"Tecno Relámpago\" vs. \"Tech Éclair\"). This compromises cultural and stylistic adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major concepts from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the distinction between temporary vs. permanent knowledge. No crucial content is omitted, though the extra explanatory interjections add noise.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and uses appropriate terminology, but the heavy inclusion of meta‑translation notes, multiple style options, and inconsistent branding severely impacts readability, fluency, and cultural adaptation. For a podcast script, the extraneous material should be removed, and the tone unified to match a spoken Spanish audience. The core information is intact, but the presentation needs substantial editing to become a natural, engaging dialogue.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 50/100.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 8, Fluency 7, Terminology 15, Contextual Adaptation 6, Information Completeness 14."
