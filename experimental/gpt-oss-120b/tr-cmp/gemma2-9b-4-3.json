  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the technical concepts are explained, but there are disruptive insertions (a block of English examples and a French sentence left untranslated) that break the flow and can confuse readers. Sentence structures are mostly logical, yet the noise lowers overall clarity.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, using appropriate Spanish idioms and syntax. However, the presence of untranslated French words (\"donc\", \"Ce serait incroyablement inefficace\") and the out‑of‑place English snippet create awkward moments and reduce the naturalness of the text.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are correctly rendered. The term \"grounding\" is translated as \"conexión\", which is less precise than the more common \"anclaje\". A few French terms remain untranslated, slightly affecting consistency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and adapts the style to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Nonetheless, the accidental insertion of English explanatory text and the leftover French phrase disturb the contextual flow and could confuse the audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present; no substantive content is omitted. The only issues are the extraneous English block and the untranslated French sentence, which add noise rather than cause loss of information.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content and maintaining the conversational tone of the podcast. The main weaknesses are the accidental inclusion of unrelated English material and a few untranslated French fragments, which affect readability, fluency, and contextual adaptation. Technical terminology is handled well, and the essential information is retained. With those issues corrected, the translation would be much stronger.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14/20."
