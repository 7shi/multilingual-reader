    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely understandable and follows the original structure, allowing readers to grasp the concepts. Minor issues affect smooth reading: a typo (\"francque\" instead of \"francés\"), an odd translation of \"Je vois\" as \"Voy.\", and occasional formal‑informal inconsistency (e.g., \"Usted\" vs. the more conversational tone of the original). These hiccups slightly hinder comprehension but do not obscure meaning.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text generally sounds natural, but a few phrases are awkward or literal. \"Usted ha entendido completamente\" feels overly formal for a podcast dialogue, \"precalentamiento\" as a translation of \"cheat‑sheet\" is odd, and the mix of formal \"Usted\" with informal remarks creates a jarring tone. Overall, the flow is good, yet these slips keep it from being fully native‑like.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are all appropriate. The term \"prompt\" is left unchanged, which is acceptable for the target audience. However, the translation of \"cheat‑sheet\" as \"precalentamiento\" is inaccurate, and the occasional mix‑up of English terms (e.g., \"fine‑tuning\" without italics) reduces consistency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent and explanatory style are preserved, and cultural references are neutral, fitting a Spanish‑speaking audience. Nonetheless, the inconsistent register (formal \"Usted\" mixed with a casual podcast tone) and the literal translation of some expressions (e.g., \"Voy\") slightly detract from an optimal adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the logical sequence is kept. The only loss is the typo \"francque\" and the sub‑optimal rendering of \"cheat‑sheet\", which do not remove content but affect precision.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical discussion accurately and retains the overall structure of the podcast script. It is readable and mostly fluent, with correct handling of most technical terminology. Minor typographical errors, occasional awkward phrasing, and inconsistent register prevent it from being fully polished. With a few edits—correcting \"francque\", using a more natural expression for \"cheat‑sheet\", and aligning the level of formality—the translation would be excellent for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 78/100.\n\nStrengths: clear presentation of concepts, correct technical terms, faithful content transfer.\nWeaknesses: typographical mistake, some unnatural expressions, register inconsistency.\nRecommendations: proofread for typos, adjust phrasing to match conversational podcast style, and replace \"precalentamiento\" with a more suitable term such as \"hoja de trucos\" or \"guía rápida\"."
