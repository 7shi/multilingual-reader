  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is difficult to follow in several places. There are untranslated English fragments (e.g., “we”, “we simply provide the documents”), residual translator notes, and abrupt shifts in register. Some sentences are grammatically incorrect (“Se le olvida todo”, “las nuevas conocimientos”), which forces the reader to pause and reinterpret. Consequently, the overall comprehension is hindered.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural constructions and gender‑agreement errors (e.g., “el IA” instead of “la IA”, “las nuevas conocimientos”). The mix of formal “usted” and informal “tú” is inconsistent, and the insertion of explanatory brackets breaks the flow. While most vocabulary is understandable, the text does not sound like natural spoken Spanish.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL” and “grounding” are correctly retained. However, occasional misuse (e.g., “las nuevas conocimientos”) and lack of consistent styling (sometimes capitalising IA, sometimes not) reduce precision. Overall, the core terminology is adequate.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator attempted to adapt certain expressions (e.g., using “consultor brillante” for “consultant”), but the presence of untranslated English and internal translation commentary shows a failure to fully adapt the content for the target audience. Cultural references are mostly preserved, yet the mix of notes and inconsistent formality weakens the adaptation.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Nearly all the original ideas are present, but some information is lost or obscured by the stray English sentences and translator notes. Minor details (such as the precise explanation of “grounding”) are present, but the extraneous material distracts and some nuances are less clear.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main technical concepts of the podcast, but its execution is problematic. Untranslated English fragments, residual meta‑translation notes, grammatical mistakes, and inconsistent register make the text hard to read and sound unnatural. Terminology is mostly correct, yet the overall presentation needs thorough editing to be suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 9/20."
