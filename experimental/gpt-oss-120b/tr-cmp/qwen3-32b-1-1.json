    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the original structure. Most sentences are clear, and the technical ideas are conveyed. Minor issues such as the stray “#black boxes” placeholder, occasional mixed hyphenation (pre‑entrenamiento vs preentrenamiento) and a few punctuation quirks slightly interrupt flow, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several awkward or incorrect expressions that affect naturalness: “cramar” is not a Spanish verb, the abbreviation switches from ICL to “AIC”, and the term “affinage” is left in French. The placeholder “#black boxes” and occasional literal translations (“chuleta” for cheat‑sheet) feel informal. Overall, a native speaker would notice these flaws, so fluency is moderate.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, and “grounding” are present. Inconsistencies appear with the French word “affinage”, the incorrect abbreviation “AIC”, and occasional untranslated English terms. Consistency could be improved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue, using a conversational style appropriate for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Cultural adaptation is adequate, though the literal “#black boxes” marker and the informal “chuleta” could be refined. Overall the message is preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, temporary vs permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memoria” features. No substantive content is omitted, and the flow mirrors the source.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and retains the podcast’s conversational character. However, it suffers from several linguistic slips (incorrect verb choice, inconsistent terminology, leftover placeholders) that reduce its naturalness for native Spanish readers. With minor editing—especially fixing the “cramar” error, standardizing technical terms, and removing untranslated markers—the text would reach a higher quality level.\nOverall rating reflects a solid but imperfect translation.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16 out of 20.\n\n---\n**Scoring summary**\n- Readability: 17/20\n- Fluency: 14/20\n- Terminology: 15/20\n- Contextual adaptation: 16/20\n- Information completeness: 18/20\n- **Final overall score:** 16/20"
