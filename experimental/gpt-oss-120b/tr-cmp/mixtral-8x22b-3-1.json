  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the podcast dialogue flows naturally. A few minor issues (e.g., the uncommon word “afino” for fine‑tuning) slightly hinder immediate comprehension, but the overall message remains understandable.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several literal renderings that feel awkward to native speakers: “el afino (fine‑tuning)”, “enraizamiento” for grounding, and the mistaken abbreviation “ACL” instead of the usual ICL. These quirks lower the fluency without breaking the text.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto). However, some key terms are mistranslated or non‑standard: “afino” instead of “ajuste fino”, “enraizamiento” for grounding, and the wrong acronym “ACL”. These choices could confuse readers familiar with the usual jargon.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original podcast tone, uses appropriate greetings, and adapts cultural references smoothly. The style remains engaging for a Spanish‑speaking audience, and no cultural mismatches are evident.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French script are conveyed: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the “memory” feature trick. Only the acronym error (ACL vs ICL) is a slight omission of precise information.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and faithful to the source material. It communicates the technical concepts clearly and retains the conversational podcast feel. The main weaknesses lie in a few non‑standard technical terms and occasional literal phrasing that affect naturalness. With minor adjustments to terminology (e.g., using “ajuste fino” and keeping the ICL acronym), the text would reach a near‑native quality level.\n\nOverall Score (average of criteria): 16/20"
