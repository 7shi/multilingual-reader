    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version flows logically and the ideas are presented in the same order as the French original. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia e ICL are explained clearly, and the analogies (consultor, estudiar a última hora, aprender a montar en bicicleta) are easy to follow. A couple of minor slips (e.g., \"conocimientos temporario\") do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Expressions like \"levantar el velo\" and \"es como contratar a un consultor brillante\" are idiomatic. Small grammatical inconsistencies (\"conocimientos temporario\" instead of \"temporales\", omission of \"en\" in \"aprendizaje contextual\") and occasional over‑literal renderings slightly break the native feel.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled consistently and appropriately: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". The occasional use of the English word \"prompt\" is acceptable in the current tech discourse. No major mistranslations of technical concepts are present.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue, adapting cultural references (e.g., using \"Hola\" and \"¡Gracias por habernos escuchado!\") appropriately. The only slight mismatch is the literal \"levantar el velo\", which is understandable but less common than \"levantar el velo\"; overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is retained. No sentences or ideas are omitted, and the supplemental explanations (e.g., clarifying that the memory feature is an automated form of ICL) are kept. Redundancy is minimal and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the original content with clear explanations and appropriate technical language. Minor grammatical errors and a few slightly literal phrases prevent a perfect score, but they do not affect the overall understanding. The work would be easily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners of a technology podcast and maintains the conversational style of the source material."
