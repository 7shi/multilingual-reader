    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences convey the ideas clearly and the logical flow mirrors the original. Minor issues such as isolated fragments (e.g., \"El preentrenamiento.\") and occasional heavy punctuation slightly hinder smooth reading, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native speaker overall. Vocabulary is appropriate and most idiomatic expressions are well rendered. There are a few literal constructions (e.g., \"Imaginen que enviamos una nueva IA a la escuela para darle una cultura general\") and punctuation quirks (commas before \"es\") that feel a bit stiff, preventing a perfect native‑like flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly translated and consistently used: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje (grounding). The only small drawback is the choice of \"afinamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\", but the meaning is clear and the terminology stays coherent throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator respects the podcast tone, keeps the informal yet informative style, and adapts typographic conventions (use of « »). Cultural references are preserved, and the Spanish version feels tailored to a Spanish‑speaking audience. No cultural mismatches are observed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as in the source. Redundancies are minimal and do not affect clarity.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the original podcast’s engaging style, and is largely readable and natural for Spanish listeners. Small stylistic and punctuation issues prevent a perfect score, but they are minor and do not affect the overall comprehension.\n\nOverall, the work demonstrates a solid grasp of both languages and the subject matter, delivering a faithful and effective adaptation of the original script.\n\nScore (average of criteria): 17.8 → 18/20."
