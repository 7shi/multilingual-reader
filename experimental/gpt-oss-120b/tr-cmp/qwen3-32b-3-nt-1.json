  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logical and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, etc.) are explained clearly. A few sentences are a bit wordy (e.g., the repeated definition of ICL), but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker in most places. There are a couple of repetitions and slightly awkward phrasings such as \"Este enfoque se llama aprendizaje en contexto, o Aprendizaje en Contexto (ICL)\" and occasional over‑use of exclamation marks, but overall the flow is smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled very well: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto* (ICL), *grounding* (anclaje) are all correctly translated and consistently used. No important term is lost or mistranslated.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal podcast tone, uses appropriate Spanish punctuation (¡ ! ), and adapts cultural references (e.g., \"consultor brillante\"). Minor nuances such as the French “une nouvelle approche plus flexible est en train d'émerger” become a slightly less idiomatic \"un nuevo enfoque más flexible está en proceso de surgir\", but the intent remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original script is present. No sections are omitted, no meaning is altered, and the content remains as detailed as the source. Redundancies are not introduced, and the translation stays concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational style of the podcast, and is easily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor stylistic repetitions and occasional phrasing quirks prevent a perfect score, but they do not affect the comprehension or correctness of the material.\n\n**Overall score:** 18/20"
