  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas and the logical flow is preserved. However, some constructions are a bit cumbersome (e.g., “Imagínese que enviamos una IA totalmente nueva a la escuela…”), and occasional formal‑informal shifts slightly affect smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward phrases and untranslated borrowings: “cheat sheet”, “ancrage”, and the mix of “Imagínese” with later informal “abres”. These reduce the feeling of native‑speaker fluency, though the overall message remains clear.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely kept consistent (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, ventana de contexto). The term “ancrage” is left in French instead of the Spanish “anclaje”, and “cheat sheet” stays in English, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with those anglicisms. Otherwise the terminology is appropriate for the intended audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural adaptation is adequate, but a few elements (e.g., retaining English “cheat sheet” and French “ancrage”) could have been localized for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor stylistic tweaks would improve relevance.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present. No significant omissions or additions are observed, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue, keeping the content complete and accurate.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical content clearly. It could be improved by smoothing out a few awkward phrasings, fully localizing borrowed terms, and ensuring consistent formality throughout. The technical terminology is mostly well‑handled, and the completeness of information is excellent. With minor refinements, it would read like a native‑speaker podcast script.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 16/20."
