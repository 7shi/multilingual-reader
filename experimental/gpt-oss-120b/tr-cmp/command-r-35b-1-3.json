  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the dialogue format is preserved. Most sentences are clear, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. However, there are occasional punctuation oddities (e.g., parentheses around “desciframos”) and some formatting artifacts (** markers) that slightly disrupt the flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward or region‑specific choices (e.g., “Imaginad” vs. a more neutral “Imaginen”, the mix of French word “affinage” left untranslated, and the use of English “prompt” without adaptation). These issues make some passages feel less smooth for a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto” are all appropriate. The occasional retention of French “affinage” and English “prompt” is minor and does not hinder comprehension, but consistency could be improved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast conversation. Cultural adaptation is adequate, though some expressions (like the parenthetical “desciframos”) feel unnecessary. The overall message about temporary vs. permanent knowledge is conveyed correctly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key ideas from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No major information is omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is kept intact. Minor re‑phrasings do not affect the content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. It maintains most of the original’s structure and terminology, making it understandable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor issues with fluency, occasional untranslated terms, and formatting artifacts prevent it from being perfect, but the core information and educational value are fully retained."
