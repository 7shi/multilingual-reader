  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. The dialogue flow is preserved and the explanations of pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto are clear. Some sentences are long and could be broken up, but overall a Spanish‑speaking listener can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several awkward phrasings and typographical errors that make the text feel less natural: \"afinado\" instead of \"afinamiento\", the typo \"afinanción\", the inserted “Luc destaca:” and occasional literal translations (e.g., \"una astucia ingeniosa\"). Vocabulary is mostly appropriate, but the occasional clumsy construction reduces fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly (preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, memoria a corto plazo). However, the translation introduces inconsistent terms such as \"ajuste contextual\" and \"ajuste continuo\" that do not appear in the original, and the typo \"afinanción\" hurts precision.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The podcast tone is kept and cultural references are neutral, which is suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor issues (e.g., the unnecessary “Luc destaca:” introduction) slightly break the natural conversational style, but overall the intent and purpose are well conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All main ideas from the French script are present: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto, la diferencia entre memoria temporal y permanente, y la explicación de las funciones de “memoria”. No major information is omitted, though some redundancy appears and a few nuances (like the exact wording of the analogy about the consultant) are softened.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in delivering the core content and maintains the educational podcast style. It is readable and mostly accurate, but suffers from occasional unnatural phrasing, typographical errors, and slight inconsistencies in terminology that prevent it from feeling completely native. With a final proofreading pass to correct the typos and smooth the awkward constructions, the translation would be of high quality.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15.8/20, rounded to 16/20.\n\n**Strengths**: clear conveyance of concepts, correct handling of most technical terms, faithful preservation of the original structure.\n**Weaknesses**: typographical errors (\"afinanción\"), occasional literal or clumsy translations, inconsistent introduction of terms not in the source.\n**Recommendation**: perform a careful edit to fix typos, replace \"afinado\" with \"afinamiento\", remove the unnecessary \"Luc destaca:\" label, and keep terminology consistent (use \"aprendizaje en contexto\" throughout)."
