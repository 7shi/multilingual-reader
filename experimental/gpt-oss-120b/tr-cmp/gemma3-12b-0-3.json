    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Sentences are generally easy to follow, and complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino or aprendizaje en contexto are explained with simple analogies. A few very long sentences could be broken up, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. Minor awkwardness appears in phrases like “Miren:” and “una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”, which feel slightly forced, but overall the flow is smooth.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, anclaje (grounding). The choice of “anclaje” is acceptable though not the most common translation; consistency is maintained throughout. No major term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French tone to a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience, preserving the informal dialogue style. Cultural references are neutral, and the speaker‑turn structure is kept. Slight informality (“Miren”) is fine for the medium.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original script is present. No key ideas are omitted, and the analogies (consultant vs. expert, cramming vs. mastering) are fully retained. Minor grammatical slips do not affect the conveyed content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains readable and fairly natural, and respects the original conversational style. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency and terminology precision, but the work is solid and suitable for a Spanish‑language podcast audience.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 17.4 → 17/20."
