    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is interspersed with editorial notes (e.g., **Versión mejorada**, **Traducción mejorada**, bullet‑point suggestions) that interrupt the narrative flow. A reader cannot follow a single, coherent conversation; instead they encounter fragmented sentences, placeholders and meta‑comments. Consequently, comprehension is heavily impeded.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Even when the Spanish sentences are grammatical, many sound stilted or overly literal (“la IA no guarda información de conversaciones anteriores” is fine, but the surrounding meta‑language, repetitions of “Versión optimizada”, and abrupt switches between registers make the whole piece feel artificial. The presence of English terms without adaptation (e.g., “prompt”, “ICL”) also reduces naturalness.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *memoria contextual* are generally correct. However, the translation is inconsistent – sometimes the French term is kept, sometimes a literal calque is used, and in many places the term is surrounded by explanatory notes rather than being integrated naturally. The handling of acronyms (ICL, GPT) is erratic.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator attempted to adapt cultural references (e.g., using “caja negra” for *boîte noire*) and to choose registers (técnico vs divulgativo). Yet the constant insertion of editorial suggestions prevents those adaptations from reaching the reader. The intended podcast tone – conversational, friendly – is lost amid the technical commentary.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original dialogue content is present in a fragmented form, but many sentences are truncated, re‑ordered, or replaced by meta‑instructions. Important nuances (e.g., the analogy of a consultant, the explanation of “grounding”) are either missing or buried in side notes, leading to loss of information.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "overall_comment": "The submission is not a finished translation but a collection of revision notes and alternative phrasings. While the translator shows a solid understanding of the subject matter and proposes many accurate term choices, the final product is unreadable as a podcast script. To be usable, the notes must be stripped away and the dialogue rewritten as a smooth, continuous Spanish conversation that preserves the original meaning, tone, and structure. As it stands, the text scores low on readability, fluency and completeness, though the technical terminology is mostly appropriate."
