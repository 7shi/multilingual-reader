  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow; sentences are logical and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor issues such as the misuse of prepositions (e.g., «bienvenido en») and occasional overly long sentences slightly reduce smoothness, but overall a Spanish reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several unnatural expressions: «¡Hola y bienvenido en», «es el estudio superficial», and the retention of English words like «prompt» and «grounding» without adaptation. These make the translation sound a bit mechanical and less like natural spoken Spanish. However, most of the phrasing is correct and the dialogue flow is preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely well‑handled: «preentrenamiento», «afinación», «aprendizaje por transferencia», «ventana de contexto», «aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)». The only slight weakness is the decision to keep «grounding» in English and not translate «prompt», which could have been rendered as «entrada» or «consulta». Consistency is otherwise good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the podcast’s informal, conversational tone and adapts cultural references appropriately. Small literal translations (e.g., «estudio superficial») feel a bit off, and the opening greeting could be smoother, but the overall intent and purpose are conveyed accurately.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and no redundant material is added. The content remains faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the original material accurately, with good handling of most technical terms. Readability is high, but fluency suffers from a few literal renderings and untranslated English words. Minor stylistic tweaks would make the Spanish version feel more natural, especially in the opening greeting and some idiomatic expressions. Overall, it is a competent translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 17/20."
