    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original. Most sentences are easy to understand, and complex concepts are explained with suitable examples. However, there are a few typographical errors (duplicate “Luc: Luc:”, missing punctuation in Camille’s line about studying for an exam, and inconsistent use of formal/informal second‑person pronouns) that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, using idiomatic Spanish (e.g., “¡Una analogía perfecta!”, “es como contratar a un consultor brillante”). Some literal renderings (“El aprendizaje en contexto es estudio de memoria”) and the mix of ‘tú’/‘usted’ reduce the naturalness. The duplicated speaker label and occasional awkward phrasing also affect fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL”, “anclaje (grounding)”. The word “prompt” is left untranslated, which is acceptable for a technical audience. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The podcast tone and explanatory style are preserved, and cultural references are appropriate for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor issues arise from inconsistent register (mix of formal ‘usted’ and informal ‘tú’) and a few literal translations that feel slightly stiff, but the overall intent and purpose are conveyed accurately.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present; no major ideas are omitted. The only loss is the duplicated speaker label, which is a formatting error rather than a content omission. The translation remains faithful to the source.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and faithfully conveys the technical content of the podcast. It excels in terminology handling and retains the explanatory tone. Minor typographical and stylistic inconsistencies (speaker label duplication, mixed pronoun usage, occasional literal phrasing) prevent it from being perfect, but they do not obscure meaning. With a quick proofread to fix those issues, the text would read as a natural, fluent Spanish podcast script.\n\nStrengths: accurate terminology, complete information transfer, clear explanations, appropriate style for a tech podcast.\nWeaknesses: a few typographical errors, inconsistent second‑person pronouns, occasional overly literal expressions.\n\nScore out of 100: 84/100."
