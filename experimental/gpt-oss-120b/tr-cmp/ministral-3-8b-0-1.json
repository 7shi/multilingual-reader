  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in the same order as the original. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained clearly and with examples that are easy to follow. Minor issues like the occasional use of the plural *informaciones* instead of the more natural singular *información* do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native Spanish speaker in most places. There are a few slightly awkward word choices – e.g., *afinado* for *fine‑tuning* (more common would be *ajuste fino*), *informaciones* (less frequent than *información*), and the phrase *aprendizaje en contexto automatizado* (a smoother alternative could be *aprendizaje contextual automatizado*). Nonetheless, no sentence is grammatically incorrect and the overall style is smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino* (though rendered as *afinado*), *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)*, *anclaje* for grounding, and *prompt* are all retained or translated appropriately. Consistency is maintained throughout. The only minor drawback is the choice of *afinado* which is less standard in the AI literature, but the meaning is clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue, using a conversational style that fits Spanish‑speaking listeners. Cultural references are neutral, and the examples (e.g., consultant analogy) are equally understandable. Slightly formal phrasing in a few sentences does not affect the overall adaptation.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No ideas, examples, or nuances are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue closely. The translation also keeps the explanatory footnotes (e.g., *In‑Context Learning*) intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, keeps the conversational flow, and is largely natural for Spanish readers. Minor lexical choices (like *afinado* and the plural *informaciones*) prevent a perfect score, but they do not detract from understanding. Overall, the work is a very solid and faithful rendering of the original podcast script.\n\nScore summary: Readability 18/20, Fluency 17/20, Terminology 18/20, Contextual Adaptation 18/20, Information Completeness 20/20."
