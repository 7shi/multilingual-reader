  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. The dialogue format is preserved and complex concepts are explained clearly. Minor issues such as a duplicated speaker tag (\"Camille: Camille:\") and a missing accent in \"¿Porque\" slightly affect smooth reading, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward or literal renderings: \"Mire:\" is a literal translation of \"Mire\" and feels foreign in Spanish (\"Mira\" would be better); the French term \"bachotage\" is left untranslated, which sounds out of place; \"¿Es entonces un método?\" diverges from the original \"C'est donc une astuce?\"; occasional missing accents and punctuation make sentences feel a bit stilted. Overall, a native speaker would understand it, but the flow is not completely smooth.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally handled well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\", etc. Consistency is good, and the Spanish equivalents are appropriate for a general‑audience podcast. The only notable lapse is the retention of the French word \"bachotage\", which should have been adapted or explained.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. It adapts cultural references appropriately and uses Spanish‑style explanations. Minor issues (the duplicated speaker tag and the literal \"Mire:\") slightly reduce the adaptation quality, but the overall message is preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No key points are omitted, and the explanations remain intact. The duplicated tag and small typographic errors do not constitute loss of content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the educational content of the podcast accurately. It excels in preserving the structure and technical explanations, though a few literal translations, a leftover French term, and minor typographical errors prevent it from being completely natural for Spanish‑speaking listeners. With slight polishing—replacing \"Mire:\" with \"Mira:\", translating \"bachotage\", fixing accents, and removing duplicated tags—the text would be fluent and fully polished.\nOverall score: 82/100, indicating a good-quality translation that needs minor refinements to reach native‑level fluency.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 17, Fluency 14, Terminology 16, Contextual Adaptation 17, Information Completeness 18 (total 82)."
