  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas are easy to follow. However, the presence of stray markup (\"}```json ```json {\") at the beginning of Luc’s line disrupts the flow and forces the reader to pause. Some sentences are overly long, which slightly hampers quick comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation uses natural‑sounding Spanish for most of the dialogue. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic. A few constructions sound a bit stiff or redundant (e.g., “El preentrenamiento, una etapa crucial…”, repetition of “aprendizaje en contexto”), but these do not severely affect overall smoothness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are correctly rendered and used consistently throughout. No major mistranslations of jargon are observed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast style to Spanish well, keeping the conversational tone. The only notable deviation is the change of the podcast’s title from \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Tecnología al Instante\", which, while understandable, alters the original branding. Apart from that, cultural references are appropriate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the substantive information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No key points are omitted, and the explanations are retained. Minor redundancies appear (re‑stating the definition of grounding) and the title change is a small loss of fidelity, but overall the content remains complete.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast’s content accurately and uses appropriate technical vocabulary. Readability is slightly marred by stray markup and occasional lengthy sentences, and the title change is a minor deviation from the source. Fluency is good, with only a few awkward phrasings. Overall, it is a solid translation that would be easily understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience, though it could benefit from a cleanup of formatting artifacts and a tighter prose style.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
