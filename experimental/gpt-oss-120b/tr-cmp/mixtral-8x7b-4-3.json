  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the main ideas and a Spanish‑speaking reader can follow the discussion overall. However, frequent grammatical slips (missing accents, incorrect gender agreement, duplicated sentences) interrupt the flow and force the reader to re‑read passages.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many expressions sound unnatural or literal (“Imaginaos…”, “Elimina todo”, “ancraje”), and there are awkward repetitions. The mix of singular/plural pronouns for IA and occasional French words (\"université\") break the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, y grounding are mostly rendered correctly. Still, some terms are mistranslated (\"ancraje\" instead of \"anclaje\"), and the article \"el IA\" is wrong, showing inconsistency in handling terminology.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent of the original dialogue is preserved and the examples stay relevant for a Spanish audience. Nonetheless, the title of the podcast switches between \"Tecnología Iluminada\" and \"Tech Éclair\", causing inconsistency, and a few cultural phrasing choices feel forced.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present; no essential information is omitted. The only drawback is a duplicated sentence in the pre‑entrenamiento explanation, which adds redundancy but does not remove content.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in transmitting the technical content, but it is marred by numerous linguistic errors, inconsistent terminology, and occasional redundancy. A thorough proofreading and stylistic edit are needed to reach a fluent, professional level suitable for a podcast transcript.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 13/20."
