  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow; sentences are generally clear and the logical flow mirrors the original. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can grasp. A few minor hiccups (e.g., \"memoria a corto plazo de la IA, o 'contexto'\" instead of the more precise \"ventana de contexto\") slightly affect smoothness but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, but there are occasional awkward phrasings: \"El modelo mismo\" (better \"El propio modelo\"), the redundant parenthetical \"Aprendizaje en Contexto (In‑Context Learning)\" and the abbreviation \"AIC\" which is not used in Spanish literature. These small issues prevent a perfect native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\" are appropriate. The main inconsistency is the omission of the standard term \"ventana de contexto\" (the original \"window of context\") and the introduction of the uncommon abbreviation \"AIC\" instead of the usual \"ICL\" in Spanish sources. Otherwise the terms are consistent and correctly translated.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish listeners effectively. Cultural references (e.g., \"consultor brillante\") are kept, and the analogy of a student or a bike rider works in Spanish as well. Minor lexical choices could be refined, but the overall intent and register are well preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the examples (English‑to‑French transfer, memory feature) are fully retained. The only slight loss is the specific term \"ventana de contexto\", which does not change the meaning but reduces precision.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the original podcast’s educational tone. It successfully explains complex AI concepts in accessible Spanish. The main areas for improvement are consistency in technical terminology (especially the \"ventana de contexto\" expression) and smoothing a few awkward phrasing choices. With these minor tweaks, the text would read as a fully natural Spanish podcast script.\n\n**Final average score:** 17.2/20"
