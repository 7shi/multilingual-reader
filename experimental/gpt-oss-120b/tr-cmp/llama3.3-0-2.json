  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original dialogue structure. However, there are a few interruptions (e.g., \"Camille: Es decir, ¿\" is left unfinished) and occasional awkward phrasing that can momentarily confuse the reader.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly naturally, but several sentences feel stiff or overly formal (mix of \"usted\" and \"tú\", \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\"). Some constructions are literal translations from French that sound odd in Spanish, and punctuation errors disrupt flow.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento (fine‑tuning)\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are accurate and consistently used. Minor issues: \"memoria de un solo uso\" could be expressed more idiomatically, but the meaning is clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast tone and adapts the content for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is straightforward. The shift to formal \"usted\" slightly changes the register compared to the original informal French, but the intent remains intact.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French script are present, but a few fragments are missing or truncated (the unfinished question by Camille) and some minor details (e.g., “el modelo mismo no aprende”) are slightly altered. Overall, the core information is retained.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content and technical concepts accurately, but it suffers from occasional grammatical slips, an unfinished line, and inconsistent formality that affect readability and fluency. Terminology is solid, and the adaptation respects the original intent, yet polishing the language would raise the overall quality.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 78/100.\n\nRecommendations: fix the truncated sentence, harmonize the register (choose either formal or informal consistently), and smooth out literal constructions to improve naturalness.\n\nScore: 78"
