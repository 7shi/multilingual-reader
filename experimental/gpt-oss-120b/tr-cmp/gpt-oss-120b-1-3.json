  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the complex ideas about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained clearly. Minor typographic quirks (French quotation marks) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. A few phrases feel slightly stiff (e.g., \"una ventana de contexto\" instead of the more common \"ventana de contexto\" or \"ventana de contexto ampliada\"), but overall the flow is smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: pre‑training → preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning → afinamiento, transfer learning → aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL is kept, and grounding → anclaje. The translator adds parentheses for the English acronyms where needed, aiding understanding.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts expressions to Spanish‑speaking audiences (e.g., \"pódcast\", \"una analogía perfecta\"). Cultural references are neutral, so no loss of meaning occurs. Slightly formal tone matches the podcast script.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No content is omitted. All examples, analogies, and explanations from the French source appear in the Spanish version. The only additions are typographic marks that do not alter meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, reads naturally, and retains the pedagogical tone of the original podcast. Minor stylistic tweaks could make it a bit more colloquial, but the translation is clear, complete, and technically sound.\n\nFinal score (out of 100): 92/100.\n\nStrengths: faithful terminology, clear explanations, good adaptation to Spanish listeners.\nWeaknesses: occasional slightly stiff phrasing and typographic remnants from the source language.\n\nRecommendation: A light edit for flow (e.g., replace \"ventana de contexto\" with \"ventana de contexto ampliada\" where appropriate) would push the score into the high‑90s."
