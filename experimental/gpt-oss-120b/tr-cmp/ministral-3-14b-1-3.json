  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the main ideas and the technical concepts are understandable. However, the text contains several editorial artifacts (e.g., the retained French interjection \"D'accord.\", parenthetical notes about Camille's tone, and a list of translation choices) that interrupt the flow. Some punctuation errors (space before «?», misplaced asterisks) also make reading slightly cumbersome.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally fluent, but there are moments that sound unnatural to a native speaker: mixed use of bold/italics, the literal translation of some expressions (\"aprendizaje por contexto\" vs the more common \"aprendizaje en contexto\"), and the presence of multiple alternatives for the same phrase (\"¿Es eso un truco entonces? / ¿Sería eso un truco? / ¿Es eso una artimaña?\"). The coexistence of several possible podcast titles at the end also reduces naturalness.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled very well. \"Pre‑training\" → \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\" → \"afinamiento\", \"In‑Context Learning\" → \"aprendizaje por contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\", and \"prompt\" are kept or explained appropriately. The terminology is consistent throughout the dialogue.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content to Spanish‑speaking listeners, using suitable analogies and culturally neutral examples. Nevertheless, remnants of the source language (\"D'accord.\", the original podcast name \"Tech Éclair\", and the explanatory note block) break the cultural adaptation and make the script feel less polished for the target audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the essential information from the original French script is present. No major ideas are omitted, and the technical explanations are preserved. The only deviation is the inclusion of an extra meta‑commentary table, which does not remove any content but adds material that was not in the source.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is technically accurate and conveys the full content of the original podcast script. It excels in handling specialized terminology and preserving the pedagogical tone. The main drawbacks are editorial leftovers (French interjections, explanatory notes, multiple title options) and occasional awkward phrasing that affect readability and naturalness. A clean‑up to remove the meta‑information and streamline the dialogue would raise the overall quality substantially.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
