    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the dialogue flows logically. Most sentences are easy to follow, and complex concepts are explained in a straightforward way. Minor issues such as the mixed phrase “el ajuste fine…” and occasional long sentences slightly reduce smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several awkward expressions that a native speaker would find odd: “el ajuste fine…”, “aprendizaje de ida y vuelta basado en IA”, and the use of “ancraje” instead of the usual “anclaje”. Punctuation and verb agreements are mostly correct, but the unnatural phrasing lowers the naturalness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well‑handled: pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, ICL (aprendizaje en contexto) are correct. The translation of “grounding” as “ancraje” is inaccurate, and the occasional mix of English/French (“ajuste fine”) is a slip. Overall terminology is acceptable but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The tone, register and intent of the original podcast are preserved. The opening greeting and the analogy style fit Spanish‑speaking audiences. Small mismatches (e.g., “ancraje”) and the mixed‑language phrase slightly affect cultural appropriateness, but the adaptation is overall effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French version are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No major omissions are observed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and retains the educational tone of the podcast. While the meaning is intact and most technical ideas are correctly rendered, there are noticeable fluency problems and a few terminology errors (especially ‘ancraje’). Addressing these would make the text sound more natural to native Spanish speakers and improve its overall polish.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria) = 16/20.\nRecommendations: replace ‘ancraje’ with ‘anclaje’, correct ‘el ajuste fine…’ to ‘el ajuste fino’, and rephrase the odd sentence about “aprendizaje de ida y vuelta”. This would raise fluency and terminology scores.\n\nOverall score: 16/20."
