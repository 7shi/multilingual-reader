  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Sentences are mostly short and clear, making the complex concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning understandable for a general audience. A few minor punctuation quirks (e.g., missing spaces before question marks) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural, but there are occasional awkward constructions such as \"Ustedes lo han entendido todo\" (a more natural \"Lo has entendido todo\" or \"Lo han captado\"), and the occasional retention of English words like \"prompt\" without a Spanish equivalent. Nevertheless, a native speaker would have no trouble reading it.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well‑handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are appropriate. \"Fine‑tuning\" is rendered as \"afinamiento\", which is understandable though \"ajuste fino\" is more common. The word \"grounding\" is correctly translated as \"anclaje\". The term \"prompt\" is left in English, which could be clarified, but overall the terminology is consistent and suitable for the intended audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., using \"consultor\" instead of \"consultant\"). The conversational tone of a podcast is preserved, and no culturally awkward expressions appear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No key points are omitted, and the flow of the dialogue is maintained. The only minor deviation is the occasional repetition of filler words, which does not affect completeness.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content clearly, maintains the podcast’s conversational style, and preserves the original meaning. Minor stylistic refinements could improve fluency and terminology precision, but the text is fully understandable and faithful to the source.\n\nStrengths: clear structure, accurate conveyance of concepts, good cultural adaptation.\nAreas for improvement: smoother phrasing in a few sentences and more consistent use of standard Spanish technical terms (e.g., \"ajuste fino\", \"instrucción\" for \"prompt\").\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
