  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clear. However, occasional awkward phrasing and a mix of formal and informal pronouns (\"Usted\" vs \"tú\") slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several unnatural expressions and typographical errors (e.g., \"Cuando iniziáis\", \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\", \"Aprendizaje en Contexto Interno\"). These make the translation feel less native‑speaker‑like, though the overall meaning remains understandable.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\". The only notable issue is the non‑standard \"Aprendizaje en Contexto Interno\" and the occasional retention of English words like \"prompt\" without explanation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Minor cultural/language mismatches appear (mix of \"tú\"/\"usted\", use of \"vuestros\"), but they do not change the message.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present; no significant omissions. Small typographical errors (\"iniziáis\" instead of \"iniciáis\") are the only flaws, but they do not affect the conveyed content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical discussion accurately and retains most of the original flavor, but it suffers from several fluency and consistency problems that prevent it from feeling fully natural to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Terminology is handled well, and the content is complete, yet the mixed register and occasional typo lower the overall quality.\nOverall score: 77/100."
