  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The evaluation cannot be performed because the source French text and its Spanish translation have not been provided. Without the actual content, it is impossible to assess how understandable the target text is for readers, whether sentence structures are logical, or if complex ideas are clearly explained.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Fluency and naturalness can only be judged by examining the Spanish rendering. Since the translation is missing, I cannot determine if the language sounds native, if there are awkward constructions, or if the vocabulary is appropriate.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology evaluation requires seeing the specific terms used in both the source and target. Without the texts, I cannot verify correctness, consistency, or adequacy of explanations.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Assessing whether the translation preserves the original intent, adapts culturally, or improves expressions needs the actual translation. In its absence, this criterion cannot be scored.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "I cannot verify that all information from the French source has been transferred to the Spanish version because neither text is available.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "The requested evaluation cannot be completed without the French source text and its Spanish translation. Please provide both texts so I can assess readability, fluency, terminology, contextual adaptation, and information completeness according to the specified criteria."
