  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly logical and the concepts are clearly explained. A few long sentences and minor punctuation issues slightly hinder smooth reading, but overall a native Spanish speaker can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are occasional awkward turns (e.g., \"Vean más bien\", \"Ustedes lo han entendido todo\", \"Es por lo tanto una memoria de un solo uso\"). Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, yet these small hiccups prevent a completely fluid reading experience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and the abbreviation \"ICL\" are correctly rendered and consistently used. The translator also kept the notion of \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\", which is a suitable choice for Spanish readers.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original podcast tone and adapts expressions to Spanish without losing the informal, conversational style. Minor issues like the use of \"Ustedes\" instead of a more neutral \"Tú\"/\"Usted\" do not affect comprehension but could be smoother. Overall the cultural and contextual adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the ideas, examples, and analogies from the French original are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted, and the translator does not add unnecessary redundancy. The content remains complete and faithful to the source.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the technical content clearly. Readability and terminology are strong points, while fluency suffers from a handful of awkward phrasing that could be polished. No important information is lost, and the adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience is appropriate. With minor stylistic tweaks, the text would read as a native‑level podcast script.\n\nOverall score (sum of the five criteria): 87/100."
