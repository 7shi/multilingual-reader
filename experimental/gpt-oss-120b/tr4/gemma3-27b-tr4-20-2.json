  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear order. Sentences are generally concise, and complex concepts are explained with adequate context (e.g., analogies with university graduates, consultants, and bike‑riding). A few sentences are slightly long, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. Minor awkwardness appears in phrases such as \"el aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje\" (the word *bachotaje* is uncommon) and occasional literal translations that feel a bit stiff, but overall the text reads smoothly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *ICL (In‑Context Learning)*, *grounding* (kept as \"anclaje (grounding)\"). The translation keeps terminology consistent throughout and provides parenthetical explanations when needed, which is ideal for the target audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., greeting with \"Hola\", using \"consultor brillante\"). The podcast tone is preserved, and idiomatic Spanish expressions are used where possible. The only slight miss is the use of the French‑style \"memoria\" as a feature name, but this mirrors the product naming and does not hinder understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is retained. No key points are omitted, and the logical progression of ideas (pre‑training → fine‑tuning → in‑context learning → memory tricks) is fully preserved. Redundancies are minimal and do not affect clarity.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational podcast style, and is easily understandable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor lexical choices (e.g., *bachotaje*) could be replaced with more common alternatives, but they do not significantly detract from the overall fluency. The handling of terminology and preservation of nuance are particularly strong, making this a solid, professional translation.\n\nOverall score (sum of the five criteria): 92/100."
