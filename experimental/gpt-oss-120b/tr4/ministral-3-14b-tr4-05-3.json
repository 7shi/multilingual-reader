    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas is preserved. Most sentences are easy to follow, but occasional duplicated speaker tags (e.g., “Luc: Luc:”, “Camille: Camille:”) and mixed use of “entrenamiento previo” vs. “preentrenamiento” create minor hiccups that slightly lower smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part; idiomatic expressions are well‑chosen and technical language is handled correctly. Small awkwardnesses (repeated labels, a few literal translations such as “memoria a corto plazo” instead of the more common “memoria de contexto”) keep it from being fully native‑like.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are accurately rendered: pre‑training → preentrenamiento (also “entrenamiento previo”), fine‑tuning → afinamiento, transfer learning → aprendizaje por transferencia, in‑context learning → aprendizaje en contexto, grounding → anclaje, etc. The occasional inconsistency between “entrenamiento previo” and “preentrenamiento” is the only notable issue.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and explanatory style. Cultural references are neutral, and the explanations remain accessible to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor typographic repetitions slightly detract from a seamless adaptation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All concepts, examples, and nuances from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is omitted; only superficial formatting glitches appear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is strong: it conveys the technical content accurately, remains understandable, and uses appropriate terminology. The main weaknesses are typographic repetitions of speaker labels and a small inconsistency in the rendering of the pre‑training term, which affect readability and fluency marginally. With a few editorial clean‑ups, the text would read as a polished, native‑level podcast script in Spanish.\nScore out of 20: 17/20 (average of the five criterion scores)."
