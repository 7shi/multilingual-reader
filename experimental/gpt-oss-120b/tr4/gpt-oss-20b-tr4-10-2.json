  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version flows naturally and the sentences are clear and easy to follow. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in simple terms. The dialogue format is preserved, and the audience can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads like a native‑speaker script. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. Minor inconsistencies appear in the use of \"tú\" vs \"usted\", but they do not hinder comprehension. Overall the language is smooth and natural.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"ajuste fino\" for fine‑tuning, \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" for transfer learning, \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and the acronym ICL are kept, and \"grounding\" is rendered as \"anclaje\". The English parenthetical labels are retained, which is useful for a mixed‑audience. A small note: \"el afinamiento\" is less common than \"ajuste fino\", but the meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references well (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", \"hoja de trucos\"). It preserves the original intent and tone of a friendly tech‑podcast. The occasional shift between formal and informal pronouns is the only slight mismatch with the French original's consistent \"vous\", but it does not affect the overall message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No sentences are omitted, and the logical progression of ideas is intact. The translation even adds a clarifying nuance in a few places (e.g., \"memoria de uso único\"), which enhances understanding without adding unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, conveying the technical content accurately while maintaining an engaging, conversational tone. Minor issues such as pronoun consistency and the choice of \"afinamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\" are the only noticeable imperfections. Overall, the text is readable, fluent, technically sound, culturally appropriate, and fully complete.\nScore: 18/20"
