    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and the ideas are easy to follow. Most sentences are well‑structured, and the technical concepts are explained in plain language. Small grammatical slips (e.g., “​Tienen todo claro.” instead of “Tienes todo claro.”, “partes” instead of “parte”) slightly hinder smooth reading but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward or non‑idiomatic expressions. “El afinado” for fine‑tuning and “Tienen todo claro” are noticeable mismatches. Overall the text reads well to a native speaker, yet the occasional literalness makes it feel a bit stilted.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely handled correctly: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, grounding → anclaje, etc. The main weak point is the translation of “fine‑tuning” as “afinado”, which is less common than “ajuste fino”. Consistency is otherwise good.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are unchanged, which is appropriate for a tech‑focused podcast. Minor pronoun‑person mismatches (second‑person singular vs. plural) slightly affect the conversational feel.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No important detail is omitted, and the flow of the dialogue remains intact. Redundancies are unchanged, matching the source.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. It is readable and faithful, but it would benefit from polishing a few idiomatic expressions and using more conventional terminology for fine‑tuning. With minor edits, it would read as a completely natural Spanish podcast script.\n\nStrengths: clear explanation of concepts, consistent terminology, complete transfer of information.\nWeaknesses: occasional non‑native phrasing, less‑common word choices for some technical terms.\n\nThe translation is functional and understandable for the target audience, requiring only light editing for native‑speaker polish.\n\nScore out of 100: 81/100."
