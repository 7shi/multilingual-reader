  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally understandable and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. However, the presence of duplicated speaker tags (e.g., “Camille: Camille:”, “Luc: Luc:”), occasional literal translations and odd word choices such as “bachorear” make some sentences harder to follow for a native Spanish reader.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several unnatural expressions, repeated fragments and occasional grammatical slips (e.g., “cuando abre una nueva ventana, parte de un contexto vacío”). The style feels stilted and the duplicated labels break the natural rhythm, so the text does not read as smooth, native‑speaker Spanish.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”/“afinamiento”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “grounding” → “anclaje”. Inconsistencies appear (both “ajuste fino” and “afinamiento”) and the English word “prompt” is left untranslated, but overall the terminology is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue, and cultural references are neutral and thus transferable. Nevertheless, the duplicated tags and occasional literal phrasing reduce the adaptation quality, making the text feel less polished for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French source are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No substantive information is lost, despite the noisy repetitions.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full technical content and maintains the conversational structure of the podcast, which is a strong point. However, typographical errors (duplicate speaker labels), inconsistent terminology, and several awkward phrasings hurt readability and fluency. A careful copy‑edit to remove repetitions, harmonize technical terms, and smooth out unnatural sentences would raise the quality significantly.\nOverall score: 71/100."
