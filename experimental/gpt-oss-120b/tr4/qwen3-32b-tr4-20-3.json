    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original script. Most sentences are easy to understand, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can follow. Minor issues such as duplicated speaker tags (\"Luc: Luc:\" and \"Camille: Camille:\") and a few slightly clunky phrasings (e.g., \"un aprendizaje memorístico\") slightly hinder smooth reading, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part and uses appropriate vocabulary. However, there are a few awkward constructions (\"Se puede tener una conversación larga y detallada\" could be \"Se puede mantener una conversación larga y detallada\"), the duplicated speaker labels, and occasional literal renderings (\"ventana de contexto\") that feel a bit stiff. Overall, a native speaker would understand it easily, but a few refinements are needed for full fluency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje (grounding)\" and the notion of \"memoria a corto plazo\" are all preserved and consistently used. No major mistranslations of jargon are observed.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. It adapts the examples to Spanish without losing nuance, and there are no culturally inappropriate expressions. Minor stylistic tweaks could make it sound more native, but the core message is intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No key points are omitted, and the logical sequence is preserved. The only irregularities are superficial (duplicate tags) that do not affect content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and faithfully conveys the original podcast script. Technical terminology is accurate and consistent, and the educational narrative is preserved. The main drawbacks are minor editorial slips—duplicate speaker labels and a few slightly unnatural phrasing—that prevent a perfect fluency score. With a quick proofread to remove the repetitions and smooth out a handful of expressions, the translation would be near‑perfect for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
