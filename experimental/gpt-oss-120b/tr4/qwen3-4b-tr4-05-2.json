    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but several grammatical mistakes (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en”, “Voy.” for “Je vois”, “conocencias” instead of “conocimientos”) and awkward phrasings interrupt the flow. Some sentences are overly literal, making them harder for a native reader to follow smoothly.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural expressions (“el aprendizaje en contexto es el apretar”, “Ella olvida todo”, “El afinamiento”) and typographical errors. Word order and verb conjugations often feel foreign, indicating a lack of fluency expected from a native speaker.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning”, “transferencia de aprendizaje”, “ventana de contexto” and “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)” are correctly rendered. However, occasional misuse of words like “conocencias” and the omission of a brief explanation for “grounding” reduce consistency.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and keeps the podcast‑style dialogue, but cultural‑specific phrasing is sometimes literal (“Hola y bienvenido en” instead of “a”). The overall message is preserved, yet the lack of polish limits the adaptation quality.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French script are present; no significant sections are omitted. Minor inaccuracies (e.g., missing nuance in the explanation of “prompt”) do not alter the core information.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in transmitting the content and technical concepts, but it suffers from numerous linguistic errors, awkward constructions, and typographical mistakes that affect readability and naturalness. While the terminology is largely accurate, the overall polish expected of a professional Spanish translation is lacking. A revision focusing on grammar, idiomatic phrasing, and consistent terminology would raise the quality substantially.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 11/20."
