  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the explanations of complex AI concepts are clear. Sentence structures are easy to follow, making the content accessible to a broad audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, but a few phrases are slightly literal (e.g., \"Puede tomar un modelo experto en inglés...\" and \"el modelo en sí no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus discusiones\"). These minor awkwardnesses prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"grounding\" are handled correctly and consistently. The occasional use of less‑common words like \"anclaje\" is still understandable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast tone and adapts idiomatic expressions (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", \"empollar\"). Cultural references are appropriate for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French script is retained. No notable omissions or added redundancies are present.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality: it conveys the original ideas accurately, uses appropriate technical language, and remains readable and engaging for Spanish listeners. Minor literal renderings keep it just shy of perfect fluency, but overall it is an excellent adaptation of the source material.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.2 ≈ 18/20."
