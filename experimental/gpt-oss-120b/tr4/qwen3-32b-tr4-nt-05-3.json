  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the concepts are clearly presented. Sentence structures are logical, and the flow mirrors the original dialogue. Minor issues such as occasional long sentences and a few missing commas do not significantly impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly natural, but there are several noticeable errors: \"una nueva enfoque\" (gender agreement), \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotage\" (awkward phrasing), and occasional literal renderings that feel stilted. Vocabulary is appropriate, yet the small grammatical slips lower the fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, anclaje, etc. The only inconsistency is the change of the abbreviation ICL to AIC, which could confuse readers familiar with the English acronym.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone well to Spanish, using suitable idioms (e.g., \"consultor brillante\"). However, a few literal translations (e.g., \"memoria a corto plazo\" without further clarification) and the aforementioned grammatical slips prevent a perfect cultural fit.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas from the original French script are present; no substantive information is omitted. The translation even retains examples and analogies, preserving the educational intent.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original content accurately and is largely understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The main drawbacks are a handful of grammatical errors and the inconsistent handling of the ICL abbreviation, which affect fluency and precision. With minor editing, the text would be fully natural and technically consistent.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 17, Fluency 14, Terminology 16, Contextual Adaptation 15, Information Completeness 19. Total = 81/100.\n\nThe translation is solid but needs polishing for native‑speaker smoothness and consistent terminology.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 81"
