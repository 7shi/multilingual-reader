  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly understandable, but the frequent insertion of English parenthetical explanations (e.g., “(This is a fascinating topic…)”) and occasional grammatical slips (such as “las conocimientos”) break the flow. These intrusions force the reader to switch languages and can cause momentary confusion, reducing overall comprehensibility.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences are phrased naturally, yet the translation suffers from awkward choices like “ancraje” for “grounding”, inconsistent use of the podcast name (“Tech Claridad” vs. “Tech Éclair”), and the presence of English fragments that feel out of place. These issues make the text sound less smooth than a native‑level version.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally well‑handled: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto” are correctly rendered. Minor problems include the less‑common word “ancraje” instead of the more usual “anclaje” and occasional missing accents, but overall the terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adds explanatory English side‑notes and changes the podcast title, which deviates from the original intent. While some adaptations (e.g., clarifying “grounding”) are helpful, the overall effect is a cluttered, less faithful rendition that does not fully respect the target audience’s expectations.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French script are present; no substantive content is omitted. The main drawbacks are the untranslated English inserts and a few minor grammatical errors, which do not remove information but affect presentation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning, but it is marred by inconsistent naming, unnecessary English interjections, and occasional grammatical slips. The terminology is solid, yet the readability and fluency suffer from the mixed‑language noise and a few awkward word choices. A cleaner, fully Spanish version without parenthetical English explanations would raise the quality significantly."
