    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are easy to follow. Sentences are generally clear and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained in an accessible way. The only minor hiccup is the duplicated label “Camille: Camille” and a slightly clunky phrase “la expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo de la IA”, which does not impede comprehension but slightly reduces smoothness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are a few awkward constructions. \"ancaje\" for grounding is uncommon (\"anclaje\" would be preferred), and the expression \"memoria a corto plazo\" feels literal rather than idiomatic. The repetition of the speaker label and occasional literal translations (“ventana de contexto” is fine, but the surrounding clause feels stiff) keep the fluency just below native level.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely well‑handled: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL are correctly rendered. However, the translation of “grounding” as “ancaje” is not the standard term and could confuse readers; a brief parenthetical explanation would improve consistency. The rest of the terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. It adapts the examples to Spanish‑speaking listeners without cultural mismatches, and the conversational style is retained. Minor typographic issues aside, the adaptation is excellent.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the only addition is the duplicated speaker tag, which does not affect content. The translation is fully complete.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is very good overall. It conveys the technical content clearly and keeps the original podcast’s conversational tone. Minor issues—such as an uncommon translation of “grounding”, a slightly literal phrasing of “memoria a corto plazo”, and a duplicated speaker label—prevent it from being perfect, but they do not hinder understanding. With a few refinements the text would read as fully native and polished."
