  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally understandable, but several sentences are awkward or contain errors that hinder smooth reading. The most serious problem is the nonsensical phrase \"Ve o.\" (a literal mistranslation of \"Je vois.\") and the inconsistent use of formal/informal address (\"Usted\" vs \"tú\"). Minor issues such as \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\" sound stiff. These problems reduce the overall readability.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text flows reasonably well in many places, but there are noticeable unnatural constructions and grammatical slips (e.g., \"Gracias por haber nos escuchado\", \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\", mixed pronouns). The use of \"AIC (Aprendizaje In-Contexto)\" is odd and the translation sometimes sounds literal rather than idiomatic. These flaws lower the fluency.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"grounding\" become \"anclaje\". Consistency is good. The only questionable choice is the acronym \"AIC\" for \"In‑Context Learning\", which is not standard in Spanish, but it does not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator kept the original podcast tone, but the mixture of formal and informal registers and a few grammatical errors (e.g., \"Gracias por haber nos escuchado\") make the adaptation feel slightly off. Cultural adaptation is adequate; no major mis‑alignments, but the register inconsistencies prevent a fully natural target‑language version.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French source are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. The only loss is the meaning of \"Je vois\" (lost as \"Ve o.\") and a slight ambiguity introduced by the unfamiliar acronym \"AIC\".",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core content and most technical concepts accurately, but suffers from several linguistic slips and register inconsistencies that affect readability and naturalness. Key errors like \"Ve o.\" and some awkward phrasing stand out. Terminology is well‑handled, and no major information is omitted, yet the overall polish expected for a professional podcast script is missing. With careful proofreading and a more consistent voice, the quality could be raised to a near‑native level.\nOverall score reflects an average performance across the criteria, landing just above the midpoint.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14/20."
