  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clearly conveyed. Sentence structures are logical and the dialogue format is preserved. Minor issues such as very long sentences and occasional ambiguous wording do not significantly impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural for native speakers: *\"Vean:\"*, *\"Usted lo ha entendido todo\"* (should be informal in this context), *\"promoción\"* for *prompt*, and the phrase *\"en backstage\"*. These awkward choices break the flow, even though the rest of the text is fluent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly translated (preentrenamiento, afinamiento, transferencia, ventana de contexto). However, the acronym ICL is rendered as *\"Aprendizaje en Contexto Interno\"*, which is inaccurate, and *\"prompt\"* is mistakenly translated as *\"promoción\"*. These mistakes affect precision.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the original intent and conversational tone, but it shifts from the informal French/English style to a formal Spanish register (*Usted* vs *tú*). This inconsistency can feel out of place for a podcast script aimed at a casual audience. Apart from that, cultural references are well‑adapted.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key points from the original script are present; no major ideas are omitted. The only loss is the slight nuance introduced by the wrong translation of *prompt*, which does not change the factual content but could confuse readers unfamiliar with the term.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core message of the podcast accurately and is largely readable. However, it suffers from several terminology inaccuracies (especially the mistranslation of *prompt* and the definition of ICL) and occasional unnatural phrasing. A revision focusing on consistent informal register and correct technical vocabulary would raise the quality considerably.\n\nOverall rating (average of criteria): 18/20."
