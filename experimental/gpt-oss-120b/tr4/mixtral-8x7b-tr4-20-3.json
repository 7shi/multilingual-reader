  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is understandable overall, but readability suffers from many parenthetical remarks about pronunciation and meta‑comments that interrupt the flow. Inconsistent use of hyphens (pre‑entrenamiento vs preentrenamiento) and occasional abrupt interjections (\"¡Claro.\") also make the text harder to follow.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish sounds mostly natural, yet there are several awkward constructions: \"ancraje\" instead of \"anclaje\", unnecessary quotation marks around \"olvidado\", literal retention of English terms like \"prompt\", and occasional over‑use of exclamation marks. These issues prevent the text from feeling completely fluent to a native speaker.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is largely preserved and correctly translated (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, ventana de contexto, memoria a corto plazo). Minor inconsistencies (hyphenation, occasional English word retention) keep the score from being higher.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent is conveyed, but cultural/linguistic adaptation is uneven. The podcast name switches between \"Tech Claridad\" and \"Tech Éclair\", and the added pronunciation notes are irrelevant for the target audience. Some expressions feel overly literal from French, reducing the natural adaptation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present; no major ideas are omitted. The only drawback is the inclusion of extraneous parenthetical notes that do not belong to the original content, but they do not erase any important information.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation faithfully reproduces the content and technical concepts of the original French podcast, but its readability and fluency are hindered by unnecessary meta‑comments, occasional lexical slips, and inconsistent naming. Terminology is solid, and the information is complete, yet the overall presentation feels cluttered for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\nA moderate level of editing would be needed to remove the pronunciation notes, harmonize terminology, and smooth out awkward phrasing, after which the translation could reach a higher quality level.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14/20."
