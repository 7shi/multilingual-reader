  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Complex ideas are explained in a straightforward manner, and the sentence flow mirrors the original dialogue. Minor issues such as occasional long sentences and a few punctuation quirks do not significantly impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation sounds natural, but there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\", mixed formal/informal pronouns, redundant capitalisation of \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\"). These reduce the native‑speaker feel, though the overall meaning remains intact.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is well‑handled. Key terms like \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" and \"prompt\" are either correctly translated or retained with appropriate explanations. Consistency is maintained throughout the dialogue.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately. Minor pronoun inconsistencies (formal vs. informal) and occasional literal renderings of French idioms slightly affect naturalness, but the overall context is preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant details are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The technical explanations remain intact.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. Readability and terminology are strong points, while fluency suffers from a few unnatural phrasing choices and inconsistent use of formal/informal pronouns. Minor stylistic tweaks would bring the text to a higher level of naturalness, but as it stands it is a competent and faithful rendering of the original podcast script.\nOverall score: 17/20."
