  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the dialogue format is preserved, making the technical discussion accessible to a general audience. A few sentences are long, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most of the text. Vocabulary is appropriate and the colloquial tone matches the podcast style. Minor issues appear, such as the informal word *chuleta* (which is acceptable in spoken Spanish but may feel too slangy for some listeners) and a slight inconsistency in the closing line where the original French title is kept. Overall, the flow is smooth.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)*, *ventana de contexto*, *grounding*. English abbreviations (ICL, fine‑tuning) are kept, which is common practice. No crucial term is mistranslated, and explanations are kept intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references (e.g., using *consultor brillante*, *chuleta*) appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only noticeable slip is the final line that reverts to the French podcast name, breaking the otherwise consistent adaptation. Apart from that, the intent, tone, and persuasive framing are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary nature of prompt‑based knowledge, and the mechanism behind “memory” features. No substantive information is omitted or added unnecessarily.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately while maintaining a conversational, podcast‑like tone that is appropriate for Spanish listeners. Minor stylistic inconsistencies (the French title at the end, occasional slang) prevent a perfect score, but they do not affect comprehension. The translator has done an excellent job balancing fidelity, readability, and naturalness.\n\nScore summary: Readability 17/20, Fluency 16/20, Terminology 18/20, Contextual Adaptation 17/20, Information Completeness 19/20."
