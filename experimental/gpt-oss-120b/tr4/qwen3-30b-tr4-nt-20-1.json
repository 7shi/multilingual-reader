  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "I cannot assess readability because the French source text and its Spanish translation were not supplied. Without seeing the sentences, I cannot determine whether the target‑language readers would find the content clear, whether complex ideas are explained, or whether the sentence flow is logical.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Fluency and naturalness can only be judged by examining the actual Spanish rendering. Since the translation is missing, I am unable to evaluate idiomatic usage, grammatical correctness, or lexical appropriateness.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology evaluation requires the source terminology and its Spanish counterpart. Without those, I cannot verify consistency, adequacy, or the need for explanatory notes.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Assessing whether the translation respects cultural nuances and preserves the original intent demands the concrete text. In the absence of any material, this criterion cannot be scored.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "I need to compare the French source and the Spanish version to see if any information was omitted, added, or duplicated. Since neither text is provided, I cannot perform this check.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "The requested evaluation cannot be performed because the French source text and its Spanish translation were not included in the prompt. Please provide both the original French passage and the corresponding Spanish translation, and I will gladly score each criterion with detailed reasoning as requested."
