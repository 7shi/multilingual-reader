  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logical and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are clear. Minor issues such as a duplicated speaker label (\"Camille: Camille:\"), occasional long sentences and a few slightly awkward phrasings (e.g., \"cacharrear para un examen\") prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and the style matches a conversational podcast. There are some small unnatural constructions (extra space before punctuation, the informal verb \"cacharrear\", and occasional literal translations that feel a bit stiff), but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\" and \"anclaje\" are all correctly rendered. The word \"prompt\" is left untranslated, which is acceptable in a technical context. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical purpose. Cultural references are neutral, so no loss of meaning occurs. The only slight mismatch is the use of \"cacharrear\", which is a colloquial Spanish term that may feel out of place in a formal podcast, but the overall message remains intact.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the flow of the dialogue is maintained. The only minor redundancy is the duplicated speaker label, which does not affect the conveyed content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, uses appropriate terminology, and remains comprehensible for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic and punctuation issues prevent it from being flawless, but they are easy to correct. Overall, the work is solid and effectively adapts the original podcast script to Spanish.\n\nStrengths: correct handling of technical vocabulary, faithful preservation of the original structure and educational tone, complete transfer of information.\nWeaknesses: occasional awkward phrasing, a duplicated label, and a few colloquial choices that could be refined for a more polished podcast style.\n\nOverall, the translation meets professional standards and would be well‑understood by listeners.\n\nScore out of 20: 17/20."
