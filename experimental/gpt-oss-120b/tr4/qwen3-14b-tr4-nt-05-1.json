  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow and conveys the concepts clearly. Sentence structures are mostly logical, and the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning are understandable. Minor issues such as the occasional long sentence and the less‑common term “el afinamiento” slightly affect smoothness, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are a few awkward phrasing choices and punctuation errors that a native speaker would avoid (e.g., “¡Exacta !”, spacing before punctuation, redundant capitalisation of ACP). The use of “el afinamiento” instead of the more idiomatic “ajuste fino” also feels slightly off. These quirks prevent a perfect fluency rating.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “anclaje (grounding)”. The only slight inconsistency is the translation of fine‑tuning as “el afinamiento”, which is understandable but not the most common term in Spanish technical literature. Consistency is otherwise good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural references are neutral and appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic remnants from French (e.g., overly formal register) are present, but they do not affect the message. Overall, the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are retained: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and the simulated “memory” feature. No essential information is omitted, and no redundant material is added beyond what is necessary for clarity.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency suffers from a few non‑native constructions and punctuation issues. Terminology is mostly appropriate, though ‘afinamiento’ could be replaced by the more common ‘ajuste fino’. Contextual adaptation and completeness are excellent. With minor polishing, the text would read as a native‑level Spanish podcast script.\n\nOverall score (sum of the five criteria): 87 / 100."
