  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the sentences are clear. Complex ideas such as pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino y aprendizaje en contexto are explained in a way that a non‑expert can follow. Only a few very long sentences could be split for easier reading, but overall the content is easily understandable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic. Minor awkwardness appears in phrases like “expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo de la IA, o ‘ventana de contexto’” and the use of quotation marks around olvidado, but these do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje (grounding). The English acronyms are retained, which is standard practice. No important term is mistranslated or omitted.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogy of a “consultor brillante” works well in Spanish. Slightly literal renderings (e.g., “ventana de contexto”) are still understandable for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No sections are omitted, and the logical sequence of the dialogue is maintained. The only differences are minor punctuation changes that do not affect meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, is readable and largely natural, and retains the conversational tone of the original podcast. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but the work is solid and suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners interested in AI concepts.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.4 ≈ 18.5 out of 20.\n\n**Final overall score:** 18.5/20"
