  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured, and complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained with simple examples. No major ambiguities hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker. Most phrasing is smooth, but a few word choices feel slightly forced (e.g., “anclaje” for grounding, “ventana de contexto” is acceptable but not the most common term). These minor hiccups prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, etc. The only slight mismatch is “anclaje” for grounding, which is understandable but less standard in AI literature.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the informal podcast tone to Spanish, using appropriate colloquialisms (“consultor brillante”, “una antisecta”). Cultural references are kept neutral, making the content accessible to a broad Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas from the original French script are retained. No important information is omitted, and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. The translation even keeps the rhetorical questions and analogies.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational style of the podcast, and is largely readable and natural. Minor terminology choices prevent it from being flawless, but the message is delivered effectively and without loss of information.\nScore: 18/20 (average of the five criteria)."
