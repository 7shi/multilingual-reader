  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow, sentences are well‑structured and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are clear. Minor punctuation quirks do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are a few slightly awkward expressions (e.g., “el aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje”, extra commas, and the literal “Se tiene la impresión”). These do not break comprehension but slightly reduce native‑speaker fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is consistently rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, transferencia de aprendizaje, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje (grounding). The Spanish equivalents are appropriate for the target audience and the English acronyms are kept for reference.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and tone, using Spanish‑cultural equivalents (e.g., “bachotaje” for cramming) and preserving the consultant‑vs‑expert analogy. A few stylistic choices could be smoother, but the overall adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is retained. No significant content is omitted or added, and the flow of ideas remains intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the technical content clearly. Terminology is well‑handled and the core message is preserved. Minor fluency hiccups and occasional slightly stiff phrasing keep it from being perfect, but overall it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nStrengths: completeness, terminology, readability. Areas for improvement: smoothing a few awkward phrases and punctuation for a more native feel.\n\nOverall score: 18/20.\n\nScore breakdown: 18 (readability) + 17 (fluency) + 19 (terminology) + 16 (contextual adaptation) + 20 (information completeness) = 90 → 18/20 overall."
