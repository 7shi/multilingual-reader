  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the ideas are clearly expressed. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained in plain language. Minor issues are the occasional retention of French quotation marks and the word \"ancrage\" left in French, which could slightly hinder smooth reading for some users.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural and fluent. Most expressions are idiomatic (\"¡Hola y bienvenida!\", \"desentrañamos la tecnología\", \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\"). A few phrasing choices feel a bit forced or literal, such as \"afinado\" for \"fine‑tuning\" and \"Es una trampa\" for \"it's a trick\", which native speakers might phrase differently. These do not break comprehension but reduce the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely well‑handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"memoria a corto plazo\" are appropriate. The translation keeps the English acronym ICL and adds the Spanish expansion, which is helpful. However, \"afinado\" is a less common rendering of \"fine‑tuning\" (\"ajuste fino\" would be standard) and the French term \"ancrage\" is left untranslated, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the French word.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original podcast tone and adapts cultural references appropriately. The conversational style is retained, and the explanations are suited to a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only minor lapse is the occasional use of French typographic quotes («  ») and the untranslated French word \"ancrage\", which slightly reduces the full adaptation to the target culture.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No key ideas, examples, or analogies are omitted, and the structure mirrors the source closely. The translation also adds helpful parenthetical explanations for acronyms, which aid understanding without adding unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality: it conveys the original content accurately, maintains the educational tone of the podcast, and explains technical concepts clearly. Minor improvements could be made by replacing less common terms (e.g., \"afinado\" → \"ajuste fino\"), fully translating the word \"ancrage\", and using Spanish‑style quotation marks. With those tweaks, the text would read as completely natural to native Spanish speakers while preserving all technical nuance."
