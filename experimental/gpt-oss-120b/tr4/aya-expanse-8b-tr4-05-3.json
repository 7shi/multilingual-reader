    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas and the flow of the dialogue is preserved. Minor issues such as the typo “conoscencias” and occasional overly long sentences slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, but there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., “el afilado” for fine‑tuning, redundant phrasing like “aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”, and the clumsy sentence about the “esquema”). These affect the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino (although later called “afilado”), transferencia, ICL, ventana de contexto, anclaje, etc. The inconsistent use of “afilado” instead of the standard “ajuste fino” is a noticeable error, but overall terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The podcast tone and informal style are well preserved, and cultural references (e.g., “Buenos días”) fit Spanish‑speaking audiences. No major cultural mismatches are present.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the original information is present; no substantive ideas are omitted. Minor punctuation issues and the typo do not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation does a solid job of transmitting the original French podcast script into Spanish. The content is complete and mostly clear, and the technical concepts are well handled. The main drawbacks are a few lexical inaccuracies (especially the use of “afilado”) and occasional awkward phrasing that prevent the text from sounding completely natural. With a bit of polishing, the translation would be excellent for a native Spanish‑speaking audience."
