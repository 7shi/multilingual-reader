  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the flow of ideas follows the original script. However, occasional French words (e.g., « Donc », « C’est logique ») and a clear typo \"Et soyoy Luc\" interrupt the reading experience, forcing the reader to pause and decode mixed language fragments.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds fairly natural in most places, but there are several awkward constructions and literal renderings that feel stilted to a native speaker (e.g., \"Et soyoy Luc\", \"Camille: Donc, tras el pre‑entrenamiento\", \"Es como contratar un consultor brillante y, en lugar de enviarlo a seguir un programa de formación de varios años…\"). These issues lower overall fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: pre‑entrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje/grounding, etc. The terms are consistently translated and the occasional English acronym is preserved appropriately.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and maintains the educational tone, but the presence of French interjections and some overly literal phrasing reduces cultural adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor adjustments would make the content feel more locally natural.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue, preserving the explanatory depth.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the core concepts and technical details of the original podcast script, but it is marred by occasional language mixing, typographical errors, and a few stiff literal translations. Improving these spots would raise readability and fluency considerably, while the technical terminology and completeness are strong points.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16.2/20.\nRecommendations: remove residual French words, correct the typo \"Et soyoy Luc\", and re‑phrase the more literal sentences to sound more idiomatic in Spanish.\n\nScore out of 20 points: 16.2"
