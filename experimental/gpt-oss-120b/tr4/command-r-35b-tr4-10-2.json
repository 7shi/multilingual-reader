  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured, concepts are explained clearly and the flow mirrors the original dialogue. A couple of very long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but overall a Spanish reader can understand everything without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. There are a few slightly awkward phrasings (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje”, “funciones de memorización son una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”) that a native speaker would probably rephrase, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (Aprendizaje In‑Context)”, “grounding” rendered as “ancorado / anclaje”. The terminology is consistent throughout and matches the level expected for a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original intent well to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural equivalents like “chuleta” for “cheat sheet” are used appropriately, and the informal podcast tone is preserved. Minor tweaks could improve the punch of some jokes, but the overall purpose and style are retained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas, examples, and analogies from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No essential information is omitted, and the content remains concise without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality: it conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational tone of the podcast, and is largely natural for Spanish readers. Minor stylistic refinements could raise fluency a point or two, but the work is solid and reliable for the intended audience.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
