  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences convey the ideas clearly and the logical flow mirrors the original French script. A few sentences are long, which slightly hampers quick comprehension, but overall a native reader can understand the discussion without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most of the podcast dialogue, but there are occasional awkward phrasings (e.g., \"los documentos de información exactos\", \"una función de memorización\", \"un modelo experto en inglés\" without an article). These do not break comprehension but prevent the text from feeling completely smooth.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje\" for grounding, etc. Consistency is maintained throughout and the chosen equivalents are the ones commonly used in Spanish AI literature.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational tone, analogies (consultor brillante, bachotaje) and cultural references are well adapted to a Spanish‑speaking audience. The translator kept the informal podcast style and respected the original intent, making the content feel native.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No essential points are omitted, and the translation does not add irrelevant material. Redundancies are minimal and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It faithfully transmits the technical content and maintains the engaging podcast voice. Minor fluency hiccups prevent it from being perfect, but they do not detract significantly from understanding. The handling of terminology and completeness is especially strong, making it a reliable Spanish version of the original French script.\n\nStrengths: accurate technical vocabulary, clear conveyance of concepts, good adaptation to the target audience. \nAreas for improvement: smoother phrasing in a few places and more consistent use of articles to enhance naturalness.\n\nScore (average of the five criteria, scaled to 20): 18.2/20."
