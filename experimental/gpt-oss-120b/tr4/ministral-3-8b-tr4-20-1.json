    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are clear. Minor hiccups (e.g., “Es una trampa.” for “C’est donc une astuce ?”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally overall, but a few expressions sound slightly odd for native speakers: “una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado” could be “una forma ingeniosa”, “Es una trampa.” sounds harsher than the original “C’est donc une astuce ?”, and “ancoraje” is not the most common term (normally “anclaje”). These small issues keep the fluency just below perfect.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. “preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)” are all appropriate. The translation of *fine‑tuning* as “afinado” is acceptable, though “ajuste fino” would be more standard. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts it for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Cultural references are neutral, and the podcast format is preserved. The only notable deviation is the use of “ancoraje” instead of the more idiomatic “anclaje”, and a few phrasing choices that feel slightly literal.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No concepts or details have been omitted, and the examples (e.g., English‑to‑French transfer) are fully retained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the technical content clearly. It is highly readable and retains the educational tone of the original podcast. Minor lexical choices (e.g., “ancoraje”, “una forma astuta”) and occasional literal renderings prevent it from being perfectly idiomatic, but they do not detract from overall understanding. The work is solid and would be easily understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
