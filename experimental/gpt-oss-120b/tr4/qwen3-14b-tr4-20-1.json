  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas mirrors the original French dialogue. Most sentences are easy to follow and the concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained in a way that a non‑expert can grasp. Minor hiccups such as the misspelling *crammar* and occasional over‑long sentences slightly affect smoothness, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few expressions feel literal or awkward: *crammar para un examen* is not a Spanish idiom (should be *estudiar intensamente*), the French term *antisèche* is left unchanged, and the alternation between *IA* and *La IA* is inconsistent. Nevertheless, the overall register is appropriate for a podcast script and native speakers would understand it without strain.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely well‑handled: *preentrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning* (kept in English), *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL* are correctly rendered. Some terms are left in French or English (*grounding*, *antisèche*) which reduces consistency, and *fine‑tuning* could have been translated as *ajuste fino* for full Spanish terminology. The terminology is accurate but not fully uniform.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a conversational podcast. Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is needed. However, the retention of a few French words (*antisèche*, *grounding*) and the literal translation of certain idioms slightly lessen the adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original script is present: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the notion of temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No substantive content is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full meaning of the original French podcast with good clarity and retains the educational tone. It is largely readable and complete, though a few lexical choices (e.g., *crammar*, untranslated French terms) and minor inconsistencies affect fluency and terminology consistency. polishing those points would bring the text to a native‑like quality.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria) ≈ 17/20.\nRecommendations: replace non‑Spanish words like *crammar* and *antisèche* with appropriate Spanish equivalents, keep technical terms consistent (either all in Spanish or all in English with first‑time explanation), and ensure uniform handling of the acronym *IA* throughout the text.\n\nOverall rating: 17/20.\n\n**Detailed reasoning**: see the per‑criterion explanations above."
