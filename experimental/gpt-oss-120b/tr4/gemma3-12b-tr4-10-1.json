  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow for native readers. Sentences are mostly short and well‑structured, and complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained clearly. A few sentences are a bit long but do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places. Minor awkwardness appears in phrases such as \"Da la impresión de que realmente están empezando a recordar\" (a more idiomatic wording would be \"parece que realmente están empezando a recordar\") and \"entre bambalinas\" (\"entre bastidores\" is more common). Overall, the flow is smooth and the vocabulary is appropriate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\". The term \"prompt\" is kept in English, which is standard in the community. Consistency is maintained throughout the script.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references well (e.g., using \"consultor\" instead of \"consultante\"). The explanations are tailored for a Spanish‑speaking audience without losing the original nuance. A few idiomatic choices could be refined, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No key details are omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is preserved. No redundant or superfluous material was added.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It faithfully conveys the technical content, keeps the dialogue lively, and mostly reads like a natural Spanish podcast script. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but they do not affect the overall comprehension or accuracy.\nOverall, the translation scores very well across all criteria, reflecting a professional and careful rendering of the original French text into Spanish.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18.4 ≈ 18/20."
