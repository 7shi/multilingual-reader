  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly clear and the flow of ideas is preserved, but there are noticeable typographical and language‑mix errors (e.g., “Et soyoy Luc”, retained French words like “Donc”, inconsistent podcast name). These distract the reader and slightly impede smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound natural, but the presence of French interjections, a typo, and occasional awkward phrasing (“informaciones” in place of a smoother alternative, “afinado” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”) reduce the overall naturalness for native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally well‑handled: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “grounding” → “anclaje”. Some English terms like “prompt” are left unchanged, which is acceptable in this context. Consistency is maintained.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience effectively, keeping the explanatory tone. Minor issues such as leftover French words and an inconsistent podcast title (“Tech Flash” vs. “Tech Éclair”) slightly weaken cultural alignment.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original script is retained; no substantive facts are omitted or altered. The explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, and memory features is complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original message accurately and preserves the technical depth. However, it suffers from a few typographical slips, occasional French remnants, and some unnatural phrasing that affect readability and fluency. Terminology is strong, and the content is complete, but a final proofreading pass would raise the overall quality.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
