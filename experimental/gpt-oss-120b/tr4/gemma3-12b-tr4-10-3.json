  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the complex ideas about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained clearly. Minor hiccups (e.g., “bambalinas”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall. Word choices are appropriate and the flow is smooth. A few expressions are slightly odd for a technical podcast (e.g., “entre bambalinas” instead of “en segundo plano”), but they do not break fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL”. The occasional use of less common words like “anclaje” is acceptable, and no key term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts idioms to Spanish culture. The consulting‑analogy and the exam‑cramming analogy work well. Slightly informal wording (“bambalinas”) could be refined, but the overall message is intact.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No sentences or nuances are omitted, and the technical explanations remain complete.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains readable and mostly fluent, and uses appropriate terminology. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve naturalness, but they do not affect the overall effectiveness of the translation.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
