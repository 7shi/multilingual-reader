  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logical and the complex ideas about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained clearly. A few minor issues (e.g., \"el afinado\" instead of \"el afinamiento\") do not impede comprehension, but they slightly affect the flow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are occasional awkward constructions: \"el afinado... ¿es ahí donde interviene el “aprendizaje por transferencia”?\", an unnecessary comma in \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es bachotaje\", and the retention of the French word \"ancrage\". These quirks make the text feel a little stilted for a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and the acronym ICL are correctly rendered. The occasional use of \"afinado\" and the retention of the French \"ancrage\" are minor inconsistencies, but overall the terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. The analogies (consultant, cramming for an exam, learning to ride a bike) are conveyed effectively for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor French remnants slightly reduce cultural adaptation, but they do not alter meaning.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present. No substantive content is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary material. The structure of the conversation is retained, ensuring the listener receives the full explanation.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the technical content clearly. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency suffers from a few awkward phrasings and occasional leftover French terms. The translation would benefit from minor stylistic polishing, but it successfully delivers the original message to a Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\n**Overall Score (out of 20):** 17"
