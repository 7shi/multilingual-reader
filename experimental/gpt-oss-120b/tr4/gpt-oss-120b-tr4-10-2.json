  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning) are explained clearly. Minor typographical issues (e.g., a duplicated speaker tag) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and the style matches a podcast script. A few literal renderings (e.g., \"el afinamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\") and the duplicated \"Luc: Luc:\" are slightly awkward, but overall the flow is smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\" are correct. The choice of \"afinamiento\" for \"fine‑tuning\" is understandable but not the most idiomatic; \"ajuste fino\" would be preferred. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using natural expressions like \"una analogía perfecta\" and \"consultor brillante\". Cultural references are neutral, so no loss of intent. Minor literal translations do not affect the overall message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original script is present. No ideas are omitted and the examples are kept intact. The only small drawback is the accidental repetition of a speaker label, which does not affect content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical concepts clearly, maintains the conversational tone of the podcast, and stays faithful to the source. Minor lexical choices (e.g., \"afinamiento\") and a typographical duplication prevent a perfect score, but the text is fully understandable and appropriate for a Spanish‑language audience.\nScore out of 20: 18/20 (average of the individual criteria)."
