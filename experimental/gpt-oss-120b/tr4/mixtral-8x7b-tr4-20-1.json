  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the technical concepts are explained, but the numerous parenthetical notes such as “(The pronunciation in Spanish would be …)” interrupt the flow and make it harder for a reader to follow. There are also occasional punctuation oddities and mixed French terms (e.g., “pre‑entrainement”) that slightly reduce clarity.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences are natural‑sounding, but the translation suffers from awkward constructions (“¡Claro. Y durante mucho tiempo…”, double exclamation marks, mixed‑language terms) and the intrusive pronunciation notes. These elements make the prose feel less smooth for a native speaker.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely correct and consistent: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL”, “anclaje”. A few terms retain French spelling (e.g., “pre‑entrainement”), but overall the terminology is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, but there is an inconsistency in the podcast name (initially rendered as “Tech Claridad” then ending with “Tech Éclair”). The explanatory parentheticals are unnecessary for the target reader and reflect a literal rather than contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original script is present; no key points are omitted. The only downside is the addition of meta‑information that clutters the text, but the core content remains complete.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and uses appropriate terminology, but readability and naturalness are hampered by unnecessary parenthetical notes, occasional punctuation and spelling inconsistencies, and an inconsistent podcast title. Cleaning up the meta‑comments and polishing the phrasing would raise the overall quality significantly.\nOverall score (out of 20): 14"
