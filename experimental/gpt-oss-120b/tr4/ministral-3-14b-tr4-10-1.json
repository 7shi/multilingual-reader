  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the podcast dialogue is preserved, making the content understandable for a non‑technical listener. Minor typographical glitches (e.g., duplicated \"Luc:\" tags, inconsistent use of quotation marks) slightly interrupt the flow, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native Spanish speaker overall. Vocabulary is appropriate and the informal podcast tone is kept. A few awkward spots appear, such as the mixed use of \"tus\" and \"vuestras\" and the double \"Luc: Luc:\" label, which feel slightly out of place. These issues keep the fluency from being perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\" (fine‑tuning), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL) and \"anclaje\" (grounding) are all present and consistently used. The occasional inclusion of the original English terms in parentheses helps readers who may be familiar with the English literature. No major terminology errors were found.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral, so no adaptation was required, and the translator kept the conversational flair. The only drawback is the inconsistent pronoun choice (\"tus\" vs \"vuestras\"), which slightly reduces the sense of a single, cohesive voice for the target audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No substantive ideas or examples have been omitted, and the explanatory analogies (e.g., consultant vs expert, cramming for an exam) are fully retained. Minor formatting redundancies do not affect the informational content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical concepts clearly while keeping the podcast’s lively tone. Minor typographical errors, a duplicated speaker label, and a slight inconsistency in pronoun usage are the main points for improvement. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI fundamentals.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
