    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences are clear, and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are understandable. Minor punctuation issues and a few slightly long sentences slightly reduce smoothness, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several lexical choices are non‑standard for a Spanish‑speaking audience. \"El afinado\" instead of the usual \"ajuste fino\", \"ancrage\" left in French, and \"silla\" for the bicycle seat are awkward. The use of italics and parentheses is acceptable, yet the overall flow suffers from these occasional unnatural expressions.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved, and key concepts such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"ventana de contexto\" are correctly rendered. However, the translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"afinado\" is uncommon, and the decision to keep \"ancrage\" in French rather than using the Spanish \"anclaje\" or \"fundamentación\" reduces consistency. Overall the terminology is adequate but not optimal.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator successfully conveys the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style of the podcast. Cultural references are appropriate, and the analogy of a consultant versus a permanent expert works well in Spanish. Small inaccuracies (e.g., \"silla\" for bicycle seat) are present but do not change the overall message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No essential details are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue. The only loss is minor nuance caused by the occasional awkward phrasing, but the factual content remains intact.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast’s educational content accurately and is largely understandable for Spanish listeners. While the meaning is preserved and the script remains complete, the fluency suffers from a few non‑standard lexical choices and occasional awkward phrasing. Improving terminology consistency (e.g., using \"ajuste fino\" instead of \"afinado\") and eliminating leftover French terms would raise the naturalness of the text. Overall, it is a good translation that only needs modest polishing to reach native‑speaker quality."
