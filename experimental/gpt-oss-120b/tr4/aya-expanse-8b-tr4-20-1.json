  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally easy to follow and the main ideas are conveyed clearly. Most sentences are logical, and the dialogue format is preserved. Minor grammatical errors (agreement, plural/singular mismatches) and occasional odd phrasing slightly hinder smooth comprehension, but a native Spanish speaker can still understand the content without major difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several unnatural expressions (e.g., \"¿qué quiere decir?\", \"¿qué es?\", \"subes al caballo\" instead of \"bicicleta\", \"Tech Luz\" for the title). Some word choices are off (\"informaciones\" instead of \"información\"), and punctuation is inconsistent. These issues make the text feel less native‑like, though overall it remains readable.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly translated correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\". The handling of ICL and the distinction between fine‑tuning and in‑context learning is accurate. Small inconsistencies (\"afinamiento\" vs \"ajuste fino\") do not affect understanding.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator generally respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately. However, the substitution of \"bicicleta\" with \"caballo\" is a serious contextual error, and the title change to \"Tech Luz\" loses the original branding. These mistakes reduce the adaptation quality.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory tricks, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. No substantive information is omitted, and the flow of the argument is maintained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the core content and most technical explanations accurately, making it understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Nevertheless, several linguistic slips—especially the bizarre \"subes al caballo\" and the incorrect title translation—affect the naturalness and cultural fidelity. Minor grammatical errors and occasional awkward phrasing also lower fluency. Overall, it is a solid translation with room for improvement in idiomatic expression and careful proofreading of key metaphors and proper nouns.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 16/20."
