  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely clear and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences are understandable, and complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinado y aprendizaje en contexto are explained with suitable examples. A few very long sentences could be split for easier reading, but overall a Spanish‑speaking audience can follow the discussion without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds mostly natural, but there are occasional awkward constructions that a native speaker would avoid (e.g., \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\", \"el afinado\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\", and the redundant parenthetical \"Aprendizaje en Contexto (ICL, por sus siglas en inglés)\"). Vocabulary is appropriate, yet the mix of formal \"Usted\" with otherwise informal tone creates slight inconsistency. These issues keep the fluency just below a perfect rating.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"anclaje\" and the acronym ICL are correctly rendered. The term \"fine‑tuning\" is translated as \"el afinado\", which is understandable but less idiomatic than \"ajuste fino\". The English word \"prompt\" is left untranslated, which is acceptable in a tech‑savvy context. Overall the terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of the podcast script. Cultural references are neutral, and the opening greeting is adapted to \"Buenos días\" appropriately. Minor issues arise from the inconsistent use of formal vs. informal address, but they do not alter the conveyed message. The adaptation is effective overall.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the examples (e.g., English‑to‑French transfer) remain intact. The only redundancy is the repeated definition of ICL, which mirrors the original text rather than an omission. The translation is therefore complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. It maintains most of the nuance of the original French script while using appropriate Spanish terminology. Minor stylistic and grammatical quirks (such as the use of \"el afinado\" and occasional formal‑informal mix) prevent it from being completely natural, but these do not impede comprehension. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17.4 → rounded to 17 out of 20."
