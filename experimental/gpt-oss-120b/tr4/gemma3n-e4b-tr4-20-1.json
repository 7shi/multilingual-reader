  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas is preserved. Most sentences are easy to understand, and the technical concepts are explained in plain language. Small issues such as the mixed‑language opening “Bonjour y bienvenido” and occasional redundancy slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., “Bonjour y bienvenido”, “Se pueden decir eso”, regional use of “vuestras”). Vocabulary is appropriate, yet the occasional literal rendering from French makes it feel a bit stilted.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (In‑Context Learning)”, “anclaje (grounding)”. The English word “prompt” is left untranslated, which is acceptable for a tech‑savvy audience. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent and tone of a podcast discussion are well conveyed. Minor cultural mismatches (mixing French greeting, use of ‘vuestras’ instead of ‘sus’ for a broader Latin‑American audience) prevent a fully optimal adaptation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the points made in the French version are present in the Spanish translation. No relevant information is omitted, and the structure mirrors the original, keeping the content comprehensive and concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is solid and faithfully transmits the content of the podcast. The main weaknesses are a few literal translations and minor language‑mixing that slightly affect readability and fluency. Technical terminology is spot‑on, and the information is complete. With a bit more polishing of idiomatic Spanish, the text would be excellent for a native‑speaker audience.\nScore total: 84/100.\n\nStrengths: accurate terminology, complete information, clear explanations. \nAreas for improvement: eliminate French‑Spanish hybrids, refine a few awkward phrases, adapt regional vocabulary for broader Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\nOverall rating: 84/100, indicating a good-quality translation that needs minor refinements for native‑level polish."
