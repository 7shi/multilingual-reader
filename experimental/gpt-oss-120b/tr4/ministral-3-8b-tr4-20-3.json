  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and follows a logical flow. Sentences are understandable and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a Spanish‑speaking audience can follow. Minor issues such as occasional missing articles or slightly clunky phrasing do not significantly hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation sounds natural, but there are a few awkward expressions (e.g., “ancoraje” instead of the more common “anclaje”, “es una trampa” for “c’est une astuce”, and the inconsistent use of asterisks around *afinado*). These hiccups make the text feel a bit forced in places, though overall it remains fluent enough for native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, fine‑tuning, etc. The handling of “grounding” as “ancoraje” is less common, and the formatting of *afinado* with asterisks is inconsistent, but the terminology is largely appropriate and consistent throughout.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts cultural references adequately. The analogy of a consultant and the explanation of memory features are well conveyed. The mis‑translation of “c’est une astuce ?” as “Es una trampa?” slightly shifts the nuance, but the overall message remains intact.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is lost, and the structure mirrors the original. Minor phrasing changes do not affect factual completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and captures the essence of the original podcast script. It is mostly readable and technically accurate, though occasional lexical choices (like “ancoraje” and “trampa”) and formatting inconsistencies detract slightly from naturalness. With minor polishing, it would be excellent for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
