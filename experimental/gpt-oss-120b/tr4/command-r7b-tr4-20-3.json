    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly clear and the ideas are conveyed in a logical order. Most sentences are easy to follow, and the technical concepts are explained similarly to the French original. Minor issues such as the English word “just”, occasional missing accents (¿Porque) and mixed formality (tú vs. usted) slightly impede smooth reading, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward spots: the English interjection “Exactly.” is left untranslated, the word “informaciones” is unnatural (should be \"la información\"), the term “ancoraje” is not the usual Spanish equivalent (\"anclaje\" or \"enraizamiento\"), and the mix of formal and informal pronouns creates inconsistency. These flaws reduce the overall fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is generally well‑handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" are correctly rendered. The word \"prompt\" is kept in English, which is acceptable in a tech‑focused podcast. The translation of \"grounding\" as \"ancoraje\" is not standard, which slightly hurts consistency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent, tone and pedagogical style of the original are preserved. Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The main drawback is the inconsistent register (mix of \"tú\" and \"usted\") that can feel jarring, but the overall message remains intact.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the content of the French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is omitted, and the examples remain the same. Only minor lexical leftovers (English words) are present, which do not constitute loss of information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transferring the educational podcast script from French to Spanish. It retains the structure, examples, and technical depth of the original. However, a few linguistic slips – English words left untranslated, non‑standard terminology, and inconsistent use of formal/informal pronouns – prevent it from reaching full native‑speaker fluency. With a light edit to correct these points, the text would be excellent.\n\nOverall score (average of the criteria) = 16/20."
