    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the concepts are explained clearly. Sentences are generally short enough to be followed easily, and the dialogue format aids comprehension. Only a few very long sentences slightly reduce ease of reading.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Word choices like “consultor brillante”, “ventana de contexto” and “entre bastidores” are idiomatic. Minor hiccups such as “aprendizaje automático en contexto” and the less‑common “afinamiento” keep it from being perfect.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: «pre‑entraînement» → “preentrenamiento”, «fine‑tuning» → “afinamiento” (acceptable, though “ajuste fino” is more common), «in‑context learning» → “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and “grounding” → “anclaje”. The word “prompt” is left unchanged, which is fine for a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts expressions to Spanish‑speaking listeners (e.g., “Hola y bienvenidos”, “consultor” instead of “consultante”). Cultural references are neutral, and the explanatory tone is preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas, examples, and analogies from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No relevant information is omitted or altered.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate, clear, and conveys the original podcast script effectively. It maintains the educational tone and the technical depth while sounding mostly natural to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor lexical choices prevent a perfect fluency score, but the work is of high quality.\n\nStrengths: faithful rendering of concepts, good readability, proper handling of technical vocabulary, and faithful preservation of the dialogue structure.\nAreas for improvement: replace less common terms like “afinamiento” with more standard equivalents, and smooth out a couple of slightly awkward phrases (e.g., “aprendizaje automático en contexto”).\n\nThe translation is ready for publication with only minimal editorial tweaks needed.\n\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 91/100."
