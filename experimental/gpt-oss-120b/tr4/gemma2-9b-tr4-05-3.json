  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly logical and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are clear. A few constructions are a bit heavy (e.g., long sentences with multiple commas) and the use of \"afianzamiento\" for fine‑tuning may cause a momentary pause, but overall a French‑speaking audience would understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally in most places, but there are several lexical choices that sound odd to native speakers: \"afianzamiento\" instead of \"afinamiento\" or \"fine‑tuning\", \"fundamentación\" for \"grounding\", and occasional literal translations such as \"se recuerda\" with quotation marks. These quirks slightly break the flow, though they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly preserved, but some key terms are rendered in non‑standard ways. \"Pre‑entrenamiento\" is fine, \"ventana de contexto\" correctly captures \"context window\", and ICL is explained. However, \"afianzamiento\" for fine‑tuning and \"fundamentación\" for grounding are unconventional and could confuse readers familiar with the usual jargon (\"fine‑tuning\", \"grounding\"). Consistency is otherwise good.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast style well, keeping the informal, conversational tone. Cultural references are neutral, and the podcast name is appropriately localized to \"Tecnología en Breve\". Minor issues remain with word choice (see terminology), but the intent and humor of the original are preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No sentences or ideas are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original. The only slight drawback is the occasional redundancy caused by literal translation of filler phrases, but the core content remains intact.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation conveys the original message accurately and keeps the educational, conversational tone of the podcast. Readability and completeness are strong points. Fluency and terminology suffer from a few non‑standard lexical choices (especially \"afianzamiento\" and \"fundamentación\") that make the text feel slightly stilted for a native Spanish‑speaking technical audience. Adjusting these terms to the commonly accepted equivalents would raise the naturalness and technical precision considerably.\n\n**Overall score (average of the five criteria)**: 15.2 ≈ 15/20."
