  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "To assess readability I need to see the Spanish translation itself (and ideally the French source) so I can judge whether the sentences flow logically, whether complex ideas are explained clearly, and whether the text is easy for a Spanish‑speaking reader to understand. Without the actual text I cannot determine if the sentence structure is clear or if any passages are confusing.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Fluency can only be judged by examining the target‑language wording. I would look for natural‑sounding expressions, appropriate idiom usage, and smooth grammar. Since the Spanish version has not been provided, I cannot evaluate any of these aspects.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Evaluating technical terminology requires comparing the French terms with their Spanish equivalents in the translation. Without the texts I cannot verify whether the correct jargon is used, whether terms are consistently translated, or whether explanations are added when needed.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Contextual adaptation involves checking whether the translation respects the cultural background of Spanish readers and preserves the original intent. This analysis also needs the actual translation to see if any cultural adjustments were made.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "To determine if any information was omitted, added, or altered, I must compare the source French passage with the Spanish version. Since neither is available, I cannot assess completeness.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "I cannot evaluate the translation because the source French text and its Spanish translation were not included in the request. Please provide both the original French passage and the corresponding Spanish translation, and I will gladly score each criterion (readability, fluency, terminology, contextual adaptation, and information completeness) on a 0‑20 scale with detailed reasoning."
