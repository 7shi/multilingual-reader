  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to understand. Sentences follow a logical order and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., \"Los nuevas conocimientos\") do not impede comprehension, but they slightly lower smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several literal renderings and awkward phrasing: \"Ustedes entendieron todo\", \"el afinado\" (instead of \"ajuste fino\"), missing inverted exclamation marks, and occasional word order that feels French‑ish. These issues prevent the text from feeling completely native.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well‑handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\", \"grounding\" (kept as \"anclaje\"). The choice of \"el afinado\" is acceptable but less common than \"ajuste fino\". The typo \"Los nuevas conocimientos\" shows a lack of consistency. Overall, terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original podcast tone and intent are preserved. The translation adapts the conversational style to Spanish listeners, using appropriate pronouns and maintaining the explanatory style. Minor cultural nuances (e.g., using \"Ustedes\") are acceptable for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted; only minor typographical errors appear, which do not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the original content accurately. It is readable and technically correct, but it suffers from a few fluency hiccups and minor grammatical errors that keep it from being fully native‑like. With a small polish—especially fixing the \"Los nuevas conocimientos\" typo, adjusting \"el afinado\" to \"ajuste fino\", and smoothing some literal constructions—the text would reach a higher quality level.\n\nScore: 84/100 (sum of the five criteria). The translation is good, but there is room for improvement in fluency and minor terminology consistency.\n\n---\n**Breakdown**: Readability 16, Fluency 15, Terminology 17, Contextual Adaptation 17, Information Completeness 19 = **84/100**."
