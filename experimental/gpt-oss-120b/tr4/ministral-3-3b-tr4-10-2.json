  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the original logical flow. However, there are several noticeable errors such as mixed‑language fragments (e.g., “Et soyoy Luc”, “Vous pueden”), a few French phrases left unchanged (“C’est logique.”), and occasional typo or missing accent. These hiccups force the reader to pause, lowering overall readability.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Native‑speaker fluency is compromised by the same mixed‑language insertions, unnatural constructions (e.g., “Ustedes entendieron todo”, “Luc: Vous pueden tomar”) and occasional grammatical slips. While most sentences are correct Spanish, the overall text feels stilted and not fully natural.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key concepts such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *afinado*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL*, *grounding* and *anclaje* are correctly rendered and consistently used. The occasional retention of English abbreviations is appropriate for a tech audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and explains the concepts for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Nevertheless, the presence of French fragments and occasional direct literal translations reduce cultural smoothness. Overall the adaptation is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the discussion of memory features. No substantive information is lost, though the podcast name is left untranslated, which is acceptable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and keeps the structure of the original podcast script. Its main weaknesses are the inadvertent mixing of French and Spanish, occasional grammatical errors, and a few unnaturally phrased sentences that affect readability and fluency. Terminology and completeness are strong points. With a careful proofread to eliminate language mixing and smooth out phrasing, the translation would reach a native‑like quality.\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 77/100 (average 15.4/20)."
