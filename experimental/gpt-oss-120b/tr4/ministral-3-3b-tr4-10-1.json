  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish reader can follow the main ideas, but the text contains frequent French remnants (e.g., “Et soyoy Luc”, “Donc”, “C’est logique”) and occasional grammatical slips (“Ustedes entendieron todo”). These intrusions interrupt the flow and require extra effort to decode, lowering readability.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally smooth, but the mix of languages and literal constructions (“Ustedes entendieron todo”, “On puede decirlo así”) make several sentences sound unnatural to native speakers. The overall cadence is uneven.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding, anclaje) are correctly rendered, though consistency suffers (e.g., “afinado” vs “ajuste fino”). No major mistranslations of concepts.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the podcast’s tone and intent, but the persistent French fragments and the inconsistent use of the show’s name (“Tech Flash” vs “Tech Éclair”) show insufficient cultural adaptation for a Spanish‑only audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original script is present; no significant ideas are omitted. Minor redundancy and name inconsistency do not affect factual completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version conveys the original content and technical ideas accurately, but readability and naturalness are compromised by leftover French words and occasional awkward phrasing. Terminology is largely appropriate, yet consistency could improve. Overall the translation is functional but needs polishing to reach a native‑speaker level of fluency and cultural adaptation."
