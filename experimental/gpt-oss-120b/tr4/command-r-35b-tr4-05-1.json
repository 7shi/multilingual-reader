    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the sentences are easy to follow. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia and aprendizaje en contexto are explained clearly. Minor hiccups like the parenthetical “(anclaje al contexto o grounding)” could be a little confusing, but overall a Spanish reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. There are a few slightly awkward phrases – e.g., “anclaje al contexto o grounding” and the colloquial “chivatazo” – that feel a bit out of place in a technical podcast script, but they do not break comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento (fine‑tuning), aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding → anclaje. The choices are suitable for a general‑audience podcast and no key term is mistranslated or omitted.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French tone and intent well for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral and the consultant analogy works. The only slight mismatch is the informal “chivatazo”, which may feel too casual for a technical discussion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original script is retained. No sections are omitted, and the examples (English‑French transfer, memory feature) are fully preserved. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality: it is accurate, clear, and largely natural. Minor stylistic tweaks (e.g., smoother phrasing for \"grounding\" and reducing colloquialism) would raise fluency, but the content, terminology and intent are faithfully conveyed.\n\nScore (average): 18.4 → 18/20 overall.\n\nThe translation would serve well for a Spanish‑language podcast audience interested in AI concepts.\n\n---\n\n**Reasoning Summary**: Readability is strong, fluency is very good with a few awkward spots, terminology is spot‑on and consistent, contextual adaptation respects the target audience with only a small colloquial slip, and information completeness is perfect. These considerations lead to the individual scores and an overall rating of 18/20.\n\n**Overall Score**: 18"
