    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original. Most sentences are easy to understand, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can follow. Minor typographical errors (e.g., missing accent in “¿Por qué”, duplicated “Camille: Camille:”, and occasional missing commas) slightly hinder smooth reading, but they do not obstruct comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few expressions feel awkward or overly colloquial for a podcast aimed at a broad audience. Words like “cacharrear” are slang and feel out of place; gender agreement errors such as “¡Exacta!” for a male speaker also break fluency. Overall the language is understandable but not completely idiomatic.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, etc., are correctly rendered and consistently used. The term “prompt” is left untranslated, which is acceptable in current AI discourse. No crucial term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original conversation are preserved. The translation adapts the examples to Spanish without losing meaning. The main drawback is the occasional colloquialism (“cacharrear”) that may not suit the podcast’s semi‑formal style, and the duplicate speaker tag, but the overall context remains faithful.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original. Minor duplication of a speaker label does not affect content completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of conveying the original podcast’s content and technical depth. Readability and terminology are strong, and the complete information is retained. Fluency suffers from a few colloquial choices and small grammatical slips, which prevent the text from sounding fully natural for a native Spanish audience. With slight polishing—replacing slang, fixing gender agreement, and correcting minor typographical errors—the translation would be excellent.\nOverall rating (average of the five criteria): 16.6/20, rounded to 17/20."
