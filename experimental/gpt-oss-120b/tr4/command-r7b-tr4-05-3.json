    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the logical flow of the original dialogue. Most sentences are clear, but a few constructions are awkward (e.g., “Aprendizaje en Contexto Interno”, “promoción” for “prompt”). These do not block comprehension but slightly reduce smoothness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several non‑native expressions and mistranslations that stand out. “Ventana de contexto” is fine, but “Aprendizaje en Contexto Interno” and the use of “promoción” are unnatural. Some sentences are overly literal (“hablar con usted”) which feels out of place in a podcast setting.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning”, “aprendizaje por transferencia” and “grounding” are correctly rendered. However, the key term ICL is mistranslated as “Aprendizaje en Contexto Interno” and “prompt” becomes “promoción”, which are inaccurate and could confuse readers.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a conversational podcast. Cultural references are appropriate, and the overall message (temporary consultant vs. permanent expert) is retained. Minor issues (e.g., formal “hablar con usted” instead of a more informal style) prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French script are present; no substantial content is omitted. The only loss is subtle nuance due to the incorrect rendering of some technical terms, but the core information remains.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast’s content and structure well, and a Spanish‑speaking audience can follow the discussion. Nevertheless, several terminology errors (especially the mistranslation of “prompt” and the ICL acronym) and occasional unnatural phrasing lower the overall quality. A revision focusing on accurate technical vocabularies and smoother idiomatic language would raise the score substantially.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14/20."
