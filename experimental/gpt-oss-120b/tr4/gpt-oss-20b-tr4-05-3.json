  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. Some sentences are long, which can slightly hinder flow, but the overall comprehension is good for the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are a few awkward choices (e.g., keeping the French word *antisèche*, the literal translation of *fine‑tuning* as *afinación* instead of the more common *ajuste fino*, and occasional clunky phrasing). These reduce the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: *preentrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *learning in context (ICL)*, *grounding* → *anclaje*, etc. Consistency is maintained throughout, and the chosen Spanish equivalents are appropriate for a lay‑person audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, adapting cultural references (e.g., “consultor brillante”). The only notable lapse is the retention of the French word *antisèche*, which feels out of place for Spanish readers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas, examples, and analogies from the French source are present. No substantive information is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the podcast script accurately and understandably. It handles technical terminology well and keeps the conversational style. Minor fluency issues—especially the occasional untranslated French term—prevent it from being perfect, but the content remains clear and faithful to the original.\n\n**Final rating:** 16/20 (average of the individual criteria)."
