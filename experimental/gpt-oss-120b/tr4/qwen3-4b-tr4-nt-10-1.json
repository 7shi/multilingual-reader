  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure, allowing readers to grasp the concepts. However, several grammatical slips (e.g., gender agreement errors, incorrect verb forms) slightly hinder smooth comprehension, especially for less‑technical listeners.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are multiple awkward expressions (\"es del bachotaje\", \"rep aprender\", \"cuando usted afinan\") and unnatural word choices that a native speaker would avoid. While the overall meaning is clear, the flow feels stilted in several sentences.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\". The translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"afinamiento\" is acceptable, though \"ajuste fino\" would be more idiomatic. Overall terminology handling is solid.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogy of a consultant is kept. Minor phrasing issues aside, the adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience is effective.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No substantive information is omitted; all key points from the French script appear in the Spanish version. The translation does not add unnecessary material, keeping the content concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full content and technical ideas of the original podcast script, but it suffers from recurring grammatical errors and some unnatural phrasing that affect readability and fluency. Terminology is largely accurate, and the overall message is preserved, making it a functional but imperfect translation.\n\nTo improve, the translator should proofread for gender agreement, verb conjugations, and choose more idiomatic expressions (e.g., \"es como el bachotaje\" instead of \"es del bachotaje\"). Consistency in technical terms (using \"ajuste fino\" for \"fine‑tuning\") would also increase naturalness.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14.8 → 15/20."
