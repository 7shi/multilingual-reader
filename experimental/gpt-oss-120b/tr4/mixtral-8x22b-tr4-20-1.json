  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated script is generally clear and follows the original flow, allowing Spanish‑speaking readers to understand the discussion. Sentence structures are logical, but there are occasional typographical glitches (e.g., duplicated speaker tags “Luc: Luc:”, minor punctuation errors) and a few awkward phrasings (“los conocimientos que proporciona en el indicio”). These slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text mostly sounds natural, but several expressions are non‑idiomatic for native speakers: “ancoraje (enlace al suelo)”, “indicio” for “prompt”, and occasional literal translations (“aprendizaje en contexto, es repasar para un examen”). The duplicated speaker labels also break the flow. Overall the fluency is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto) are correctly rendered. However, the abbreviation ICL is changed to AIC without explanation, and the translation of “grounding” as “ancoraje (enlace al suelo)” is unusual. “Prompt” is rendered as “indicio”, which is not standard in the AI community. Consistency is mostly maintained, but some terminology choices could confuse readers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone for a Spanish audience, preserving the consultant‑vs‑expert analogy and the informal banter. Cultural references are minimal, so no major mismatches. Minor unnatural phrasing (e.g., “aprendizaje en contexto, es repasar para un examen”) slightly reduces the adaptation quality.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the original information is present; no substantive content is omitted. The only issues are typographical (duplicate speaker tags) and the slightly off rendering of a few terms, but the meaning remains intact. Redundancy is not a problem.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. Readability and completeness are strong, while fluency and terminology could be refined, especially regarding specific AI jargon (prompt, grounding, ICL). Minor editing would eliminate duplicated tags and improve idiomatic expression, raising the quality to near‑native level.\n\nFinal overall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
