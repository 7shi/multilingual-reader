    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and preserves the structure of the original dialogue. Sentences are short enough to be easily understood, and complex concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) are explained clearly. Minor punctuation quirks (e.g., missing accent in “¿Por qué”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural to a native speaker. Word choices such as “desentrañamos”, “ventana de contexto” and “hoja de trucos” are idiomatic. There are a few slightly awkward spots – “informaciones” (plural) instead of the more common “información”, the comma in “El aprendizaje en contexto, es estudiar…”, and a typo “systema” → “sistema”. These imperfections keep the fluency just shy of perfect.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: “preentrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning (afinación)”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (aprendizaje en contexto)”, “anclaje (grounding)”. The translation keeps the English acronym ICL and explains it, which is appropriate for the target audience. The only minor issue is the occasional use of “informaciones” where a singular noun would be smoother, but it does not affect technical accuracy.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the dialogue to Spanish‑speaking listeners without losing the original intent. Cultural references are neutral, and the conversational tone is preserved. The metaphor of a “consultor brillante” works well in Spanish. The only small oversight is the typo mentioned above, which does not alter the overall message.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No sentences or ideas have been omitted, and the explanatory content remains intact. The translation even retains the parenthetical explanations (e.g., “grounding”).",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and in an accessible way, preserving the educational tone of the podcast. Minor typographical errors and a few slightly odd word choices prevent a perfect score, but they do not detract significantly from the overall comprehension or professionalism of the text. With a quick proof‑read to fix \"systema\" and polish a couple of phrasing details, the translation would be essentially flawless.\n\nOverall score (average): 18.4/20."
