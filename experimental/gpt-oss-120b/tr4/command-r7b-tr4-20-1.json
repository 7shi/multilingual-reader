    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the ideas of the original French podcast clearly. Most sentences are understandable and the logical flow is preserved. However, the mix of formal \"Usted\" with the informal podcast tone, and occasional abrupt phrasing (e.g., \"Exactamente. And this learning starts...\" where the English word remains) slightly hampers smooth comprehension for a typical listener.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the text reads fairly naturally, but there are several awkward constructions: the English interjection \"Exactly.\" left untranslated, the literal \"Usted lo ha comprendido todo\" which sounds stilted, and the use of \"partimos de un contexto vacío\" instead of a more idiomatic phrasing. These issues make the translation feel less fluid than a native‑speaker rendering.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally well handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are appropriate. The main drawback is the typo \"ancoraje\" instead of the correct \"anclaje\" (grounding), which could confuse readers. Otherwise terminology is consistent and suitable for the target audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the explanatory intent and the pedagogical tone of the original. Nevertheless, the shift to a formal \"Usted\" register does not match the casual, conversational style of a podcast, and the occasional English residue reduces cultural adaptation. The core message is intact, but style adaptation could be improved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No major information is omitted, and the examples (English‑French transfer, memory feature) are retained. The translation is concise without unnecessary redundancy, preserving the full content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid in terms of content fidelity and technical accuracy, successfully transmitting the complex concepts discussed in the podcast. However, stylistic inconsistencies (mix of formal and informal registers, leftover English words) and a typo in a key term slightly reduce its naturalness and polish. With minor revisions to align the register with a podcast audience and correct the terminology error, the translation would be excellent."
