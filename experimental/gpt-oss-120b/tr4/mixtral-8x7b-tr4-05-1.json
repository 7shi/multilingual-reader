    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is cluttered with parenthetical notes, English fragments, and meta‑comments (e.g., “(The pronunciation in Spanish would be similar…)”, “(Note: …)”). These intrusions break the flow and force the reader to filter out irrelevant information, making the script harder to follow. Sentence structures are often awkward, especially where the original French had a smooth conversational rhythm.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unidiomatic expressions (“¡Claro! Este aprendizaje…”, “el afilado (afinamiento)”, “ancraje”, “ajuste fine”). It also mixes languages (English words like “prompt”, “ICL”, “fine‑tuning”) and occasionally swaps the speaker’s name (\"Lucas\" instead of \"Luc\"). These issues make the Spanish sound stilted and unnatural for a native‑speaker audience.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are inconsistently rendered. \"Fine‑tuning\" becomes \"ajuste fine\", a hybrid that is not standard Spanish. \"Grounding\" is translated as \"ancraje\", which is not a recognized term; the usual translation is \"anclaje\" or simply \"grounding\" in quotes. Some terms like \"pre‑entrenamiento\" are split incorrectly, and the word \"IA\" is left unchanged, which is acceptable, but the mixture of French/English terms reduces consistency.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains many explanatory notes intended for the translator rather than the listener, which detracts from the podcast’s purpose. Cultural adaptation is minimal; the script still feels like a literal French‑to‑Spanish conversion rather than a version tailored to a Spanish‑speaking audience. The inclusion of the original podcast name “Tech Éclair” at the end, while the rest is “Tech Claridad”, is inconsistent.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory vs. permanent knowledge, and the “memory” feature workaround. However, the extra parenthetical remarks sometimes obscure the core information, and a few minor nuances (e.g., the distinction between “window of context” and “short‑term memory”) are less clear due to clumsy phrasing.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the essential content but is marred by excessive translator notes, inconsistent terminology, and numerous unidiomatic expressions. For a podcast script intended for native Spanish listeners, a cleaner, more natural version that removes the meta‑comments and uses established technical vocabulary would be needed.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 8/20."
