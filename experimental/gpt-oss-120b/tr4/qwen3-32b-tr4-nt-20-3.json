  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas mirrors the original French. Sentences are understandable, and complex concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) are explained in simple language. Minor hiccups such as occasional long sentences and a few punctuation issues do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural: \"una nueva abordaje\" (gender error), \"es del bachotage\" (mixes French), and occasional missing articles or mismatched gender (\"una joven recién graduada\" works but later \"el IA\" vs \"la IA\"). Some phrasing is literal and feels stilted, though a native speaker would still understand. These flaws reduce the naturalness.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly preserved and correctly rendered (preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, grounding → anclaje). The acronym AIC is introduced without explanation, and the French loan‑word \"bachotage\" is left untranslated, which can confuse readers unfamiliar with the term.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural adaptation is adequate (e.g., using \"consultor brillante\"). Minor issues like singular \"bienvenido\" instead of plural \"bienvenidos\" are present but do not affect overall messaging.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas from the source are retained; no significant omission or addition is observed. The only loss is the brief clarification of the AIC acronym, which is a minor completeness issue.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation transmits the original content accurately and keeps the pedagogical tone of the podcast. However, it suffers from several grammatical slips, a few untranslated French terms, and occasional unnatural phrasing that affect fluency and terminology consistency. A native‑speaker edit would easily polish these points while preserving the solid informational backbone of the text.\n\nScore breakdown: readability 16/20, fluency 13/20, terminology 14/20, contextual adaptation 15/20, information completeness 18/20. The average yields a solid 15/20 overall rating, indicating a good but improvable translation.\n\nRecommended improvements: correct gender agreement (\"un nuevo abordaje\"), replace \"es del bachotage\" with a Spanish equivalent (\"es como estudiar intensamente\"), provide a brief explanation for the acronym AIC, and smooth out occasional literal translations to enhance naturalness.\n\nOverall score: 15/20."
