  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas, and complex concepts are explained with clear examples. Minor issues such as occasional punctuation errors (e.g., an unnecessary comma in \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es como memorizar\") and a few slightly clunky constructions do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most of the script, using appropriate everyday Spanish. Some literal renderings (“El preentrenamiento.” as an isolated line, \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es como memorizar\") feel a bit stiff, and a couple of word choices could be smoother (e.g., \"consultor brillante\" is acceptable but \"consultor destacado\" might sound more idiomatic). Overall, the flow is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\" are all accurate and consistent. The occasional omission of the English original term in parentheses does not cause confusion. The terminology is appropriate for a non‑specialist audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are neutral, and analogies (consultant, cramming for an exam, learning to ride a bike) are adapted well to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor literalness is present but does not affect the message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source appears in the Spanish version. No sections are omitted, and the sequence of ideas is retained. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy nor lose any essential detail.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid. It conveys the technical content clearly, uses appropriate terminology, and maintains the conversational tone of the podcast. A few minor fluency tweaks and punctuation adjustments would raise it to near‑perfect quality, but the current version is highly understandable and faithful to the source.\n\nStrengths: accurate terminology, complete transfer of information, good adaptation of analogies. Areas for improvement: smoother phrasing in isolated statements and consistent handling of parenthetical English terms.\n\nThe translation would be readily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners interested in AI concepts.\n\nFinal score (out of 100): 89/100."
