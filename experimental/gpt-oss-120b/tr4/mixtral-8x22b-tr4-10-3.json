  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are not overly long and the flow of the dialogue is preserved. A few constructions are slightly clunky (e.g., *«Imagínese que se envía una nueva IA a la escuela»*), but they do not hinder comprehension. The main ideas and analogies are clearly conveyed, so a native‑speaker reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, but there are occasional awkward phrasings and lexical choices that feel a bit literal: *«ancoraje»* instead of the more common *«anclaje»*, *«le proporciona los documentos de información exacta»* (a bit redundant), and the redundant parenthetical definition *«aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (aprendizaje en contexto)»*. Overall, the language is smooth enough, but these minor issues prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto* (ICL). The choice of *«ancoraje»* for *grounding* is understandable but not the most standard term; *«anclaje»* or *«enraizamiento»* would be more idiomatic. Consistency is good, but the occasional use of English terms in parentheses (e.g., *grounding*) could be streamlined. The terminology is adequate for the intended audience, though not optimal.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast title to *«Tech Relámpago»* and later to *«Tecnología Express»*, which creates inconsistency. Apart from that, cultural references are preserved and the tone of a podcast dialogue is maintained. The occasional literal translation of idioms (*«bachotage»* for *cramming*) works, but the name inconsistency slightly weakens the adaptation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present, including the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and the discussion of memory features. The only notable deviation is the inclusion of meta‑comments like *«Translation: Luc: Precisely…»* which are not part of the original dialogue, and the name change at the end. These do not omit essential information, but they affect conciseness and fidelity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of conveying the technical content of the original French podcast into Spanish. It is readable and largely faithful, with only minor issues in fluency, terminology choice, and consistency of the podcast name. The translator handled complex concepts well, but could improve by polishing awkward phrasing, using more standard technical vocabulary, and keeping proper nouns consistent throughout the text. Overall, it is a good translation that would be easily understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience, though there is room for refinement.\n\n**Final Scores (out of 20):**\n- Readability: 17\n- Fluency: 16\n- Terminology: 15\n- Contextual Adaptation: 14\n- Information Completeness: 16"
