  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text that is present is generally understandable and the sentences flow logically. However, several crucial speaker turns are missing, which forces the reader to guess the missing content. The occasional odd word choice (e.g., \"afinamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\") does not break comprehension but slightly reduces smoothness.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "When the translation is present, the language is mostly natural, but there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., \"montas en silla\" instead of \"montas en bicicleta\", \"la competencia está anclada\"). Moreover, the numerous blank lines where the speakers should speak make the dialogue feel fragmented, which detracts from fluency.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are rendered correctly. The term \"afinamiento\" is acceptable but less common than \"ajuste fino\". The biggest issue is the omission of whole sections that introduce key concepts like \"ventana de contexto\" and \"ICL\", so the terminology coverage is incomplete.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the informal podcast tone and generally adapts the content for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are preserved. Nevertheless, missing speaker turns remove important explanatory nuances, so the original intent is not fully conveyed.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A significant portion of the original script is absent: Camille’s question about transfer learning, Luc’s explanation of the context window, the discussion about memory features, and several bridge sentences are omitted. This loss of information is critical for understanding the subject.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the overall style of the podcast but is severely incomplete. Large sections of dialogue are missing, which undermines both the informational content and the coherence of the conversation. The parts that are present are mostly clear, though occasional awkward phrasing and less‑common term choices reduce naturalness. A thorough revision is needed to add the omitted sentences, smooth out the odd expressions, and ensure consistent use of technical vocabulary (e.g., \"ajuste fino\" instead of \"afinamiento\"). Once the missing content is restored and the minor linguistic issues are fixed, the translation would be much more effective."
