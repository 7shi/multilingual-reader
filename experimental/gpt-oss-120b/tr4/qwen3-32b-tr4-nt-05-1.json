  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to understand. Sentences are generally clear and the logical flow mirrors the original. A few constructions are slightly clunky (e.g., “ventana de contexto” and “Aprendizaje In‑Contexto”), but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds fairly natural for native speakers, but there are occasional awkward phrasings such as “una IA totalmente nueva” and the mixed use of capitalised acronyms (AIC). Overall, the language is smooth enough for a podcast script, though it could be polished further.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, grounding → anclaje, etc. The biggest issue is the introduction of the non‑standard acronym AIC (Aprendizaje In‑Contexto) instead of the common “aprendizaje en contexto” or “ICL”. This may confuse readers familiar with the English acronym.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the informal, conversational tone of a podcast and adapts idioms appropriately (e.g., “hoja de trucos” for cheat‑sheet). Cultural references are suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience, and the overall intent of the original is retained.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present. No major ideas are omitted, and the explanations remain intact. Minor wording differences (e.g., AIC) do not constitute loss of information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is clear and faithful to the source. It conveys the technical concepts well and adapts the podcast style appropriately. The main areas for improvement are the consistency of technical acronyms and smoothing a few slightly unnatural expressions. The translation would be very effective for a Spanish‑speaking audience with a modest polishing pass.\n\nOverall Score (average of the five criteria): 16/20.\n\nScore: 16"
