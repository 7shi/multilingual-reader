  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but frequent grammatical slips (e.g., “el aprendizaje en contexto, es del copiar”, “la anclaje”, “los conocimientos” → “las conocimientos”, “franción”) and punctuation errors break the flow. Some sentences are overly literal, making the logical progression feel a bit stilted for a native reader.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds awkward in many places. It retains French‑style constructions, uses inappropriate gender agreements, and contains typographical errors (e.g., “franción”). Phrases like “Usted ha entendido todo” (instead of “¡Has entendido todo!”) and “es del copiar” are not natural Spanish. The overall fluency is below native level.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and “ventana de contexto” are correctly rendered. However, a few terms are mistranslated or misspelled (“franción” instead of “francés”, “anclaje” for “grounding” without explanation). Consistency is decent but not perfect.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and does not add culturally specific adaptations, which is acceptable for a technical podcast. Nevertheless, literal translations and gender errors (e.g., “la anclaje”) sometimes reduce the natural resonance with Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the “memory” feature. No major content is omitted, though the occasional typo could cause momentary confusion.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main technical concepts but suffers from numerous linguistic inaccuracies that hinder readability and naturalness. While the terminology is largely correct, the many grammatical errors, misspellings and literal phrasing make the text feel like a machine‑generated draft rather than a polished script for a Spanish‑speaking audience. A thorough proofread and stylistic revision are needed to reach a professional quality level.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 12/20."
