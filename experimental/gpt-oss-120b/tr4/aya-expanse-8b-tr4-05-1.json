  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences convey the original meaning clearly, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can grasp. Minor issues such as the typo \"conoscencias\" and a few slightly clunky phrasings (e.g., \"da la impresión de que la IA recuerda\" instead of a smoother alternative) prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural to a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and the dialogue style is retained. However, there are a few punctuation inconsistencies (missing opening exclamation marks, \"¡Exacto.\" instead of \"¡Exacto!\"), and some literal renderings that feel a bit stiff (e.g., \"el modelo en sí no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de vuestras discusiones\"). These quirks lower fluency slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely accurate: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" and \"anclaje\" are correctly used. The major error is the use of \"afilado\" for fine‑tuning, which is misleading, and the typo \"conoscencias\". Because of these mistakes the terminology handling is not fully reliable.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content well to a Spanish‑speaking audience. It uses familiar expressions, respects the informal podcast tone, and keeps the original intent intact. Cultural references are neutral, and the dialogue feels appropriate for the target listeners. Only negligible stylistic issues are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No ideas or examples have been omitted, and the structure mirrors the source. The only loss is minimal, caused by typographical errors that do not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. Readability and completeness are strong, and the adaptation to Spanish is effective. The main weaknesses lie in a few terminology inaccuracies (notably \"afilado\" for fine‑tuning) and minor typographical/punctuation errors that slightly disrupt fluency. With a quick proofread and correction of the technical term, the translation would reach near‑native quality.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
