  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in clear, step‑by‑step language. Sentence structures are logical, and the dialogue format helps comprehension. A few sentences are long, but they do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, but there are several awkward or redundant expressions: “Aprendizaje In‑Contextual” (unusual term, the common phrase is “aprendizaje en contexto”), the repeated definition of «anclaje» (\"el concepto de «anclaje» (anclaje)\"), and occasional Anglicisms left untranslated (prompt, model) that feel slightly out of place. Overall it is smooth, but these hiccups prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, etc. The translator kept consistency across the dialogue. Minor issues are the change of the acronym ICL to AIC and the occasional retention of English words, but they do not cause confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent, tone and pedagogical style of the original podcast are preserved. The examples (consultor brillante, bachotaje) are culturally appropriate for Spanish‑speaking audiences. No meaning is lost, and the translation adapts the content to the target readership without unnecessary literalness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No key points, examples or analogies are omitted, and the flow of the conversation remains intact. The only variation is the acronym change, which does not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and maintains the educational, conversational tone of the podcast. Minor fluency issues (redundancies, uncommon phrasing, and an altered acronym) keep it from being flawless, but they do not hinder comprehension. Overall, it is a solid and faithful rendering of the original French script into Spanish."
