  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many duplicated speaker tags (e.g., \"Camille: Camille:\" and \"Luc: Luc:\"), grammatical slips (\"las conocimientos\", missing accents, inconsistent use of punctuation) and occasional awkward phrasing. These issues break the flow and force the reader to pause, reducing overall comprehension.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most sentences are understandable, the text feels unnatural in several places. Examples include \"El aprendizaje en contexto es bachorear\" (uncommon verb choice), literal translations that sound stiff, and the repeated \"Luc:\" labels that interrupt the dialogue. The overall tone is not as smooth as a native‑speaking Spanish podcast script.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ICL\" and \"ventana de contexto\" are correctly rendered. The translation of \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\" is acceptable in this context. Minor inconsistencies (e.g., \"memoria a corto plazo\" vs. \"memoria a corto plazo de la IA\") do not significantly affect understanding.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The core intent of the original dialogue is preserved, and cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, the repeated speaker labels and some literal translations (e.g., \"bachorear\" for \"cramming\") feel slightly off‑beat, preventing a fully natural adaptation.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major concepts from the French source are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent knowledge distinction, and the explanation of \"memory\" features. No substantial content is omitted, though the duplication errors add noise.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the technical content and overall message of the original podcast, but it is marred by formatting glitches, repeated speaker tags, and several grammatical/idiomatic errors that hurt readability and fluency. Technical terminology is mostly accurate, and the information is complete, yet the text would require careful proofreading and stylistic polishing to be suitable for a native Spanish audience.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 60/100."
