  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to understand. Sentences are generally short and logical, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained clearly. Minor hiccups (e.g., a few long sentences) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic. Some passages feel slightly forced, such as \"Aprendizaje In‑Contextual\" (ICL is normally kept as \"aprendizaje en contexto\") and the redundant use of «anclaje» (anclaje) which feels a bit clunky. Overall, the flow is smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, etc. The only inconsistency is the change from ICL to AIC, which could confuse readers familiar with the English abbreviation. Otherwise terminology is consistent and appropriate for a general‑audience podcast.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a conversational podcast. Cultural references are neutral, and the explanations are adapted to Spanish‑speaking listeners without losing nuance. Small issues like the abbreviation change slightly affect adaptation, but the overall message remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No sentences or ideas are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary material. The content is concise yet complete.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and keeps the lively podcast tone. Minor stylistic inconsistencies (especially the handling of the ICL abbreviation and occasional redundant phrasing) prevent a perfect score, but they do not detract from overall clarity and usefulness.\n\nOverall score (average of the criteria): 18/20."
