  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the original structure, but several typographical and lexical errors (e.g., “conocencias” instead of “conocimientos”, missing accents, inconsistent use of “Usted”/“tú”) slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are many unnatural constructions (“Usted ha entendido todo”, “El aprendizaje en contexto, es estudiar apresuradamente”, mixing English word “Simply”), inconsistent formality, and occasional French loan‑words left untranslated, which make the prose feel awkward to native speakers.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: “entrenamiento previo”, “afinado”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “anclaje”, etc. The terminology is consistent and appropriate for a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and uses relevant analogies (consultor, bicicleta). However, the retention of French words like “antisèche”, mixed registers, and occasional literal translations reduce cultural adaptation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present; no substantive information is omitted. Minor phrasing issues do not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content and the conversational tone of the podcast, but it suffers from several linguistic slips, inconsistent register, and a few untranslated loan‑words that affect readability and naturalness. With a careful edit to correct the errors and fully adapt idioms, the quality could rise significantly.\n\nFinal score (out of 100): 78/100."
