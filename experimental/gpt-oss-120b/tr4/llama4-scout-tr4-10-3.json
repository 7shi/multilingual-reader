    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas and the logical flow is preserved. A few long sentences could be broken up, but overall a native reader can understand the concepts without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several awkward or unidiomatic expressions (e.g., \"Entendido todo.\", \"Es pues un truco.\", \"Más bien, vean:\"), and occasional punctuation issues. Despite these, the translation reads naturally enough for most of the dialogue.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\" are appropriate. Acronyms such as ICL are retained, and the terminology is consistent throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and analogies (consultant, exam cramming, bicycle riding). Minor cultural phrasing quirks exist, but they do not hinder the message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the supplementary explanations are kept intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the technical content effectively. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency suffers from occasional non‑native phrasing. The translation could be polished further to sound more natural, but it successfully transmits the original podcast’s message and nuance.\n\nStrengths: faithful rendering of concepts, consistent terminology, complete coverage of the source.\nWeaknesses: some awkward sentences and literal translations that feel stiff.\n\nA moderate level of post‑editing would bring the fluency up to the level of the other criteria.\n\nScore out of 20 (average of the five criteria): 17.4 → 17."
