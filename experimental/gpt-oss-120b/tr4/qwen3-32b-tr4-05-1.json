  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and the sentences flow logically. Complex ideas such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can follow. Minor issues like occasional long sentences and a few punctuation quirks do not significantly hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most of the text, but there are a few awkward expressions (e.g., \"apuntalar para un examen\" instead of a more idiomatic \"empollar para un examen\"). Some terms are left in English (prompt, ICL) without a Spanish equivalent, which is acceptable in a technical podcast but still feels slightly stilted. Overall, native speakers would understand it, but a few phrases feel forced.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: \"transfer learning\" → \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"window of context\" → \"ventana de contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\". \"Fine‑tuning\" is rendered as \"afinamiento\", which is accurate and consistent throughout. The few retained English words (prompt, ICL) are common in the field, so the terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., comparing the model to a \"consultor brillante\"). The explanation of the new \"Memoria\" feature is clear for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic choices could be more localized, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key points from the French script are present: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, la diferencia entre conocimiento temporal y permanente, y la explicación de la funcionalidad de \"Memoria\". No relevant information is omitted, and redundancy is minimal.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. Readability and terminology are strong, and the essential information is fully retained. Fluency suffers from a few non‑idiomatic expressions and occasional English insertions, which prevent it from being completely natural. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a technical podcast audience, with only minor refinements needed for polish.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
