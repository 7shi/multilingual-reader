  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas and the technical concepts are explained in a clear way. Minor typographical issues (duplicate speaker labels, inconsistent use of *vuestras* vs *sus*) slightly interrupt the flow, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native Spanish speaker. Word order and vocabulary are appropriate, and the conversational podcast tone is preserved. Some awkward markings (asterisks around terms, duplicated \"Luc: Luc:\" and \"Camille: Camille:\") and occasional overly literal renderings (e.g., \"memoria a corto plazo\" instead of the more common \"ventana de contexto\") reduce fluency marginally.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled consistently: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto* (ICL), *ventana de contexto*, *anclaje*, and *prompt* are all retained or correctly translated. The inclusion of English originals in parentheses helps readability for a technical audience. No major mistranslations are found.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French podcast style to Spanish effectively, using appropriate salutations and punctuation. Cultural references are neutral, and the informal, explanatory tone is kept. Minor inconsistencies (mix of \"vuestras\" and \"sus\") are present but do not affect the overall intent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the original dialogue is present; no substantive information is lost. The only issues are formatting glitches (duplicate speaker tags) that do not omit meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is very good. It conveys the original message accurately, uses appropriate technical language, and reads naturally for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Small typographical and formatting errors prevent a perfect score, but they are easy to fix and do not detract from the overall quality.\n\nStrengths: faithful rendering of concepts, consistent terminology, clear explanations. Weaknesses: occasional duplicated labels, minor inconsistency in pronoun usage, and some unnecessary markup that slightly hampers fluency.\n\nThe translation would be ready for publication after a quick proofreading pass to clean up the duplicated speaker tags and streamline the markup.\n\nScore (average of criteria): 16.8 → rounded to 17/20."
