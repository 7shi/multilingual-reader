  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the explanations of concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia and aprendizaje en contexto are clear. A few very long sentences and minor punctuation slips slightly hinder smooth reading, but the overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several literal or foreign insertions that feel odd to a native speaker: \"una antisèche\" (French word left unchanged), the use of \"bachotaje\" (rare) and the retention of the English acronym \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\" without a full Spanish equivalent. Minor agreement errors and occasional missing accents also affect fluidity. These issues prevent a fully native feel.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. \"Preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\" and \"memoria a corto plazo\" are correctly rendered and used consistently. The only drawback is the untranslated \"prompt\", which could have been rendered as \"entrada\" or \"instrucción\". Overall the terminology is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast tone and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., \"consultor brillante\"). The conversational style is retained, and the explanations remain accessible. The use of the French word \"antisèche\" breaks the adaptation slightly, but otherwise the text aligns well with Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French source is present. No major ideas or examples are omitted, and the logical flow of the dialogue is maintained. Minor typographic differences (missing question marks, slight wording tweaks) do not affect the conveyed content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original message accurately and keeps the technical depth required for a tech‑focused podcast. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency suffers from a few untranslated or overly literal elements. With a small cleanup of foreign terms and a smoother phrasing of some sentences, the version would be near‑native quality. Overall it is a solid translation that serves its purpose well, though it falls short of being perfectly natural for native Spanish speakers.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16.2 ≈ 16/20."
