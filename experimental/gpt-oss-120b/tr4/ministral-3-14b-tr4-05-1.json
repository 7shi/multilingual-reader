  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences convey the original meaning, but occasional duplicated speaker labels (e.g., “Luc: Luc:”, “Camille: Camille:”) and inconsistent naming of the pre‑training step (“preentrenamiento” vs “entrenamiento previo”) slightly disrupt the flow.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in many places, but there are several awkward constructions: “Miren:” after a sentence, the literal translation of “grounding” as “anclaje” with the parenthetical English, and the redundant speaker tags. These quirks make the text feel a bit stilted for a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly rendered (preentrenamiento, afinamiento, transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, prompt, etc.). The main drawback is the inconsistency in how the pre‑training stage is named, which could cause minor confusion. Overall the terminology is appropriate and consistent enough for the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent, keeps the podcast‑style dialogue, and adapts cultural references appropriately for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor issues such as duplicated speaker labels and occasional literal translations do not alter the overall message, but a smoother adaptation would improve the experience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key points from the French original are present: explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the discussion of “memory” features. No significant information is lost, and the translation does not add irrelevant material.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and keeps the conversational tone of the podcast. It is readable and technically sound, but it suffers from some repetitive speaker tags, minor inconsistencies in terminology, and a few unnatural phrasing choices. With a light editorial pass to clean up the duplicates and smooth out the wording, it would reach a near‑native level of quality.\n\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 79/100."
