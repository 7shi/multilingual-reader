  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure. Most sentences convey the ideas clearly, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can follow. However, there are occasional mismatches in register (mix of \"tú\" and \"usted\") and a few awkward phrasings (e.g., \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\") that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several expressions are stilted or inconsistent. Phrases such as \"cuando iniciáis\" versus \"cuando abres\" switch between vosotros and tú forms, and the use of \"Usted\" feels out of place in an otherwise informal podcast. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., missing accents, unnecessary \"interno\" in \"Aprendizaje en Contexto Interno\") reduce overall fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\". The only notable issue is the translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as simply \"ajuste\" instead of the more precise \"ajuste fino\", which could cause slight ambiguity. The word \"prompt\" is kept in English, which is acceptable for the target audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast’s conversational tone and intent, but the inconsistent use of formal vs. informal pronouns changes the perceived audience. Some expressions are overly literal (e.g., \"Aprendizaje en Contexto Interno\") and could be simplified. Overall, the cultural adaptation is adequate but not optimal.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French original are present in the Spanish version. No major pieces of information are omitted, and the supplemental explanations (e.g., about \"memoria\" functions) are accurate. The translation is therefore complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the original podcast script’s content and technical depth. It is readable and mostly fluent, though the inconsistent register and a few unnatural phrases prevent it from feeling completely natural to a native Spanish listener. Technical terminology is well handled, with only minor lapses, and the information is fully retained. With some polishing of pronoun consistency and phrasing, the translation would reach a higher level of polish.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15.4 → rounded to 15/20."
