  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are clear and the flow of the conversation mirrors the original French podcast script. Some long sentences could be split for better clarity, but overall a Spanish‑speaking reader can understand the concepts without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, using appropriate Spanish syntax and vocabulary. A few phrases feel slightly formal or literal (e.g., \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\", \"Es una analogía perfecta\") and there are minor awkward constructions (\"El aprendizaje en contexto, es como estudiar para un examen\"). These do not impede comprehension but prevent the text from being completely fluid.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are all correctly rendered and consistently used. The occasional retention of English abbreviations (ICL) is appropriate for a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue while adapting idioms to Spanish. Cultural references are neutral, which works for a broad audience. Slightly formal register in parts (use of \"Usted\") could be softened, but the overall adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No key ideas, examples, or analogies are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, conveying the technical content accurately and in a way that is largely understandable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor issues with phrasing and formality keep it from being perfect, but the terminology is spot‑on and the full meaning of the original is retained. A small editorial pass to smooth out a few sentences would bring it to an excellent level."
