  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas, and complex concepts are explained with suitable examples. Minor issues such as occasional long sentences and inconsistent capitalization of \"IA\" do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally, but there are noticeable grammatical slips: \"Tomas una modelo\" (gender mismatch), \"ancoraje\" (less common than \"anclaje\"), and the formal “Imagínese” that feels slightly out‑of‑place in a podcast tone. These affect the smoothness for a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, etc. The occasional unconventional choice (\"ancoraje\") is the only deviation. Consistency and accuracy are otherwise strong.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the podcast title to \"Tech Relámpago\" and keeps the conversational style, which is appropriate for Spanish‑speaking audiences. A small inconsistency appears at the very end where the title changes to \"Tecnología Express,\" slightly breaking the continuity.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present, including examples and analogies. The only extraneous material are the editorial notes like \"Translation:\" that were left in the text, but they do not remove any essential information.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the original podcast script into Spanish. It preserves the educational tone, explains technical ideas clearly, and uses appropriate terminology. However, a handful of grammatical errors, a non‑standard word choice, and a minor title inconsistency prevent it from being flawless. Overall, it is a good, functional translation that would be well understood by the target audience, though a final proofread could raise its quality to a native‑level standard.\n\nTotal score: 78/100 (average 15.6/20)."
