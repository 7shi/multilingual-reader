  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and follows the original structure. Most sentences convey the ideas without ambiguity, and the technical concepts are explained in an accessible way. Minor issues such as duplicated speaker tags (e.g., \"Luc: Luc:\") and occasional over‑long sentences slightly hinder smooth reading, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward constructions and literal renderings (e.g., \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es como empollarse\" with an unnecessary comma, and the repeated \"Luc: Luc:\"). Some expressions could be more idiomatic, yet a native speaker would understand the text without difficulty.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\", \"grounding\" are correctly translated or kept in their accepted Spanish forms. Consistency is maintained throughout the dialogue. Only a very small point of possible improvement is the choice between \"afinamiento\" and the more common \"ajuste fino\", but the current term is acceptable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast tone and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., \"¡Hola y bienvenidos...\", \"consultor brillante\"). The intent of the original is fully conveyed, and the Spanish version feels tailored to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor typographic glitches do not affect the overall adaptation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present. No substantive content is omitted, and the examples (English‑to‑French learning, memory vs. fine‑tuning) remain intact. The only discrepancies are formatting artefacts (duplicate speaker labels) that do not delete any meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and faithful to the original. It communicates complex AI concepts in a clear, engaging manner suitable for a podcast audience. The main drawbacks are minor typographic errors and occasional slightly stiff phrasing, but these do not undermine the quality. The handling of technical terminology is particularly strong, and the adaptation respects the target culture and format.\n\nTo reach a higher score, the translator could polish the flow by removing duplicated tags, smoothing out a few literal constructions, and possibly using more idiomatic equivalents for a couple of terms.\n\nScore out of 100: 85/100, indicating a high‑quality translation with room for minor refinements."
