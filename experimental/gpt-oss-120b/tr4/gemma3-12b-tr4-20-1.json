  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the dialogue flow mirrors the original. Complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained clearly, so a Spanish‑speaking listener can understand without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker. Most expressions are idiomatic (e.g., \"Imaginen que enviamos a una IA…\", \"es como contratar a un consultor brillante\"). A few spots are slightly literal – \"Miren:\" and \"una forma astuta\" – but they do not break fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are rendered consistently and appropriately: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"anclaje\" for grounding, etc. No important term is lost or mistranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the target audience’s cultural and linguistic expectations. It uses familiar Spanish phrasing while preserving the original intent and tone of the podcast. Minor literal choices remain acceptable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and the supplemental explanations (e.g., analogies) are retained, keeping the information complete and concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, reads smoothly, and remains faithful to the original’s style. Only a few minor stylistic tweaks could make it sound even more natural, but the work is solid and ready for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
