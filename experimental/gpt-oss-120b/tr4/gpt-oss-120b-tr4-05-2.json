  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. Only a few very long sentences could be split for easier reading, but overall comprehension is excellent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural to a native speaker. Vocabulary and idiomatic expressions are appropriate, and there are no glaring grammatical errors. The occasional colloquial term (e.g., “chuleta”) is acceptable in a podcast context but slightly informal.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje (grounding) and memoria a corto plazo are correctly rendered and used consistently. The occasional retention of the English term in parentheses (e.g., fine‑tuning) helps clarity for bilingual audiences.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately. The use of “chuleta” conveys the informal idea of a cheat‑sheet without losing meaning. No cultural mis‑steps are observed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and the content remains concise without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical concepts clearly, maintains the conversational tone of the podcast, and uses appropriate Spanish terminology. Minor stylistic tweaks (splitting long sentences, considering regional variations of informal words) could raise it to perfection, but the current version is fully functional and natural for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\nTotal score: 93/100."
