    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the flow of ideas follows the original script. However, frequent intrusions of French words and phrases (e.g., \"Et soyoy Luc\", \"C’est là où\", \"Je veo\", \"Merci de nos avoir écoutés\") interrupt the reading experience. There are also a few typographical errors and mixed pronouns (\"Ustedes han entendido\" vs. \"Ustedes lo han entendido\"). These issues lower the ease with which a Spanish‑speaking audience can follow the conversation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound unnatural to a native Spanish speaker. The mix of languages creates awkward constructions (\"On puede decirlo\", \"Ustedes han entendido todo\", \"Cuando abre una nueva ventana, empiezas\"). Some verb forms are incorrect or missing (\"Casi parece una estrategia\" should be \"Casi parece una estrategia\"). The overall tone is conversational, but the linguistic inconsistencies make the text feel stilted.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely preserved and correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". The translator sometimes keeps the original French terms (\"pré‑entraînement\", \"affinage\") which is acceptable in a bilingual podcast context, but a consistent choice would improve clarity. Overall the specialized vocabulary is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and educational purpose, but cultural and linguistic adaptation is uneven because French fragments remain throughout. This can confuse Spanish‑only listeners and reduces the sense that the content has been fully localized for the target culture. Apart from the occasional French idiom, the adaptation is adequate.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No major ideas or examples are omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is retained. Minor errors (extra \"Et\" before \"soyoy\", occasional duplicated words) do not affect the factual completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in transmitting the full informational content of the podcast and uses the correct technical vocabulary for an audience familiar with AI concepts. Nevertheless, the frequent mixing of French and Spanish, along with several grammatical slips, hampers readability and naturalness. A cleaner, monolingual Spanish rendition—removing French interjections and fixing minor syntax errors—would raise the overall quality significantly.\n\n**Suggested improvements**:\n1. Eliminate all French words/expressions that are not part of proper nouns (e.g., replace \"Et soyoy Luc\" with \"Yo soy Luc\").\n2. Ensure consistent pronoun usage and verb agreement.\n3. Choose either the Spanish translation of technical terms or keep the original term consistently, but avoid toggling between languages.\n4. Review punctuation and typographical errors (missing accents, stray asterisks).\n\nWith these revisions, the translation would be much more fluent and reader‑friendly while preserving the pedagogical intent of the original podcast."
