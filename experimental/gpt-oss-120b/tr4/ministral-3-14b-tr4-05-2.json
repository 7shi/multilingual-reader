  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly clear and the flow of ideas follows the original. Most sentences are understandable, but there are occasional duplicated speaker tags (e.g., “Camille: Camille:”) and leftover English words like “prompt” that can momentarily confuse the reader.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds fairly natural, but several literal renderings and odd expressions (e.g., “Miren:” instead of a more natural “Vean”, “así que parece que la IA recuerda… pero en realidad solo le dimos un resumen justo antes de que empezara a hablarme”) break the smoothness. Retaining English terms such as “fine‑tuning” and “prompt” also reduces native‑speaker fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely handled correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL”. The only drawback is the inconsistent use of English terms (e.g., “prompt”, “fine‑tuning”) which could have been fully translated or explained.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts well to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the pedagogical analogies remain effective. Minor phrasing choices (like “Miren”) feel a bit literal but do not alter meaning.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present. No significant content is omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is retained. The only minor issues are formatting redundancies and leftover English words, which do not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is accurate and complete, conveying the technical concepts clearly. It would benefit from a light edit to remove duplicated speaker labels, replace a few literal phrases with more idiomatic Spanish, and fully translate remaining English terms. After such polishing, the text would read very naturally to a native Spanish audience."
