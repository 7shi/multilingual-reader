  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall easy to follow and the dialogue flow is preserved. Most sentences are clear, and the technical ideas are understandable. Minor issues such as missing accent marks (\"¿Porque\"), a few awkward phrasings (\"Eso es por qué\"), and the occasional typo (\"re aprender\") do not seriously impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are several unnatural expressions: \"apuntalar\" for \"bachoter\", \"aprendizaje memorístico\" for \"bachotage\", \"potencia\" instead of \"potencial\" or \"poder\", and the construction \"Eso es por qué\". These affect the fluidity for a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as «pre‑entraînement», «afinamiento», «ventana de contexto», ICL and «grounding» are correctly rendered and used consistently. The Spanish version also keeps the English acronyms. A few minor choices (\"memorización\" vs \"memoria\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\") are acceptable, so the terminology handling is solid.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish well, preserving the explanatory style and the consultant‑vs‑expert analogy. Cultural references are neutral, so the intent is conveyed. The few lexical slips (e.g., \"apuntalar\") slightly reduce the adaptation quality.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present; no major sections are omitted. However, the nuance of \"bachoter\" is lost with the inaccurate translation \"apuntalar\", and the explanation of cramming is weakened. These minor gaps lower the completeness score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and faithfully reproduces the content of the original French podcast. It is generally readable and keeps the technical concepts intact. Nevertheless, there are several linguistic inaccuracies and unnatural phrasing that a native speaker would notice. Addressing the mistranslations of \"bachoter\" and smoothing out the awkward expressions would bring the quality closer to a native‑level translation."
