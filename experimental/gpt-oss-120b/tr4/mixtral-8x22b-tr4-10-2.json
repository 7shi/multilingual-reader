  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained clearly. Minor issues (e.g., occasional repetition, inconsistent use of the podcast name) slightly disrupt smooth reading, but the overall comprehension is good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, using appropriate Spanish syntax and vocabulary. Some phrases feel a bit forced or redundant (e.g., “aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (aprendizaje en contexto)”, “ancoraje” and “enclavamiento” for grounding). The retention of the English word “prompt” is acceptable for a technical audience but breaks fluency for a general listener.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, Memoria. The handling of “grounding” is inconsistent – the translation uses the non‑standard “ancoraje” and later “enclavamiento”, which are not the usual Spanish equivalents. The term “prompt” is left in English, which is acceptable but could have been glossed. Overall terminology is solid but not flawless.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast title to “Tech Relámpago”, which fits the Spanish market, but later switches to “Tecnología Express”, creating inconsistency. Cultural references are otherwise appropriate, and the conversational tone is kept. Minor mismatches in terminology (grounding) slightly affect adaptation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No essential idea or example is omitted, and the additional parenthetical notes (“Translation: …”) are correctly kept. The only loss is stylistic elegance, not content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and is largely understandable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. It handles most technical concepts well, though a few inconsistent terms (grounding, podcast name) and occasional awkward phrasing prevent it from being fully polished. With minor revisions to terminology and consistency, the text would reach a higher level of naturalness and professional quality.\nOverall rating (average of the five criteria): 15/20.\n\nScore: 15"
