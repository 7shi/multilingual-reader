  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clearly expressed. Most sentences flow logically, and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained in a way a non‑expert can grasp. Minor issues such as the clumsy phrasing “¿Qué es?” after “La diferencia entre memorizar para un examen y dominar realmente un tema” slightly disrupt comprehension, but they do not impede overall understanding.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward constructions: \"¿Qué quiere decir?\" after \"Es decir,\"; \"Da la impresión de que realmente empiezan a recordar cosas de una sesión a otra\" (a more idiomatic phrasing would be \"parece que realmente recuerda\"), and occasional missing or misplaced punctuation. These issues prevent the text from feeling completely fluid to a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje\", \"memoria\" are all correctly translated and used consistently for the most part. The only inconsistency is the occasional switch between \"ajuste fino\" and \"afinamiento\", which could confuse readers unfamiliar with the synonym.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapted the title to \"Tech Relámpago\", a suitable Spanish equivalent, and the overall tone matches the original podcast style. Cultural references are preserved, and the dialogue remains lively. Minor literal renderings (e.g., \"una antisèche\" rendered as \"un esquema\") are acceptable, though a more colloquial term could improve resonance.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key information from the French script is retained: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and the notion of temporary vs. permanent knowledge. No substantive content is lost, and the examples (English‑French transfer, consultant analogy) are intact. Only negligible punctuation omissions are noted.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is strong. It conveys the technical content accurately and maintains the conversational tone of the podcast. Readability and completeness are high, while fluency and terminology could be polished slightly to eliminate a few awkward phrases and ensure consistent use of technical vocabulary. The adaptation to Spanish cultural context is effective, making the episode accessible to a Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\n**Total score:** 85/100 (average 17/20 per criterion). The translation is of high quality with room for minor refinements to reach native‑like perfection."
