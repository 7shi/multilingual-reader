  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the explanations of pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto are clear. Minor issues such as the inconsistent use of the podcast name at the end («Tech Éclair» instead of «Tech Relámpago») and a slightly clunky phrase “Cuando abre una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío” do not impede comprehension but slightly lower the score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, but there are a few literal constructions and small grammatical slips (“partes de un contexto vacío” should be “parte de un contexto vacío”, “Da la impresión de que realmente empiezan a recordar cosas” could be smoother). The use of the colloquial term “chuleta” is acceptable in informal podcast language but may feel out‑of‑place for a more formal technical audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled consistently and appropriately. Key terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “ventana de contexto”, and “anclaje (grounding)” are correctly rendered and kept uniform throughout. No major mistranslations of technical concepts.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts well to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using idiomatic expressions and culturally familiar analogies (e.g., comparing the model to a consultant). The only slight misstep is the retention of the French podcast title at the very end, which breaks the linguistic consistency. Overall, the intent and tone of the original are preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No relevant details are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The content remains as comprehensive as the source.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. Readability and terminology are strong points, while fluency suffers from a few minor grammatical slips and an inconsistent podcast name. The adaptation to the target audience is good, though the occasional colloquialism could be refined for a more formal setting. The translation retains all essential information, making it a reliable version of the original script.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17.2/20, rounded to 17/20."
