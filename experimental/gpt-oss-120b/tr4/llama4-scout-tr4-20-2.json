    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the flow of the conversation is preserved. However, there are several interruptions by meta‑comments (e.g., “Here is the translation: Luc:”) and occasional punctuation issues that make the reading experience a bit rough. Some sentences are long and could be broken for clarity, but the main ideas remain clear to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation uses mostly correct grammar and appropriate vocabulary, but there are moments that sound literal or awkward (“Es un truco entonces”, “Se puede decir eso”, “ventana de contexto”). The inclusion of multiple alternative phrasings inside the same line also disrupts naturalness. Overall it sounds passable but not fully native‑like.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”, “anclaje”. The translator kept acronyms and introduced the Spanish equivalents consistently. Minor issues: “prompt” is rendered as “solicitud”, which is acceptable, and a few English words slip through, but terminology is largely accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational tone and intent of the original are preserved, and cultural references are neutral, which works for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The presence of editorial notes and alternative translations inside the dialogue detracts from a seamless adaptation, but the core message and humor remain intact.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are conveyed: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the “memory” tricks used by some platforms. A few meta‑remarks that do not belong to the original script are inserted, and there is a small redundancy with the English note, but no critical information is lost.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the essential technical concepts and the friendly podcast style, and most terminology is correctly rendered. Nevertheless, the text suffers from editorial intrusions, occasional unnatural phrasing, and minor punctuation issues that reduce readability and fluency. Cleaning up the meta‑comments and smoothing the phrasing would bring the translation to a higher level of professionalism.\nOverall score: 15/20."
