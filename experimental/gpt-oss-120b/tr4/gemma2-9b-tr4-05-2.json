  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally easy to follow and the logical flow of the dialogue is preserved. Sentences are not overly long, and complex concepts are explained in a clear manner. However, a few lexical choices (e.g., “el afianzamiento” for fine‑tuning, “fundamentación” for grounding) are uncommon and may momentarily confuse readers, slightly lowering readability.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly overall and respects Spanish punctuation rules. Most expressions are natural, but occasional awkward phrases such as “el afianzamiento”, “memorización” and “fundamentación” sound unnatural to native speakers. These minor hiccups prevent a perfect fluency rating.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely correctly rendered (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL). The translation of fine‑tuning as “afianzamiento” and grounding as “fundamentación” diverges from the standard terminology (“ajuste fino”, “anclaje”) and may cause confusion, especially for readers familiar with AI literature. Consistency is maintained, but appropriateness suffers.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the podcast’s style to Spanish, preserving the informal, conversational tone. The shift from \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Tecnología Rápida\" and later to \"Tecnología en Breve\" shows some inconsistency in branding, but the overall intent and cultural tone are well conveyed. Minor wording choices could be more idiomatic.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No essential points are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The content is as complete as the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the original message effectively. Readability and completeness are strong points. The main weaknesses lie in terminology and occasional unnatural phrasing, where more standard AI vocabulary would improve clarity for a Spanish‑speaking technical audience. Overall, it is a solid translation that would be readily understood, but polishing the specialized terms would raise its quality further.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
