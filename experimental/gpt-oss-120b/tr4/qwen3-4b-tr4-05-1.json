    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure. Most sentences are clear, and the main ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje en contexto, memoria) are conveyed. However, occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en…”, “Voy.”) and minor grammatical slips make the flow less smooth for a native reader.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several non‑native constructions and outright errors: *apretar* instead of a proper translation for “bachotaje”, misuse of *conocencias*, gender agreement mistakes (*estos herramientas*), and odd word choices like *antecedencia*. These reduce naturalness and make the text feel translated rather than original.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly kept correctly (pre‑entrenamiento, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding → anclaje). The English loan‑words *fine‑tuning* and *ICL* are acceptable. Nevertheless, the mistranslation of “learning in context is cramming” to *es el apretar* shows a lack of precision, and some terms are not explained when they could be (e.g., “memoria a corto plazo”).",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the podcast format and keeps the conversational tone. Cultural references are neutral, so no major mismatches. Some sentences could be better adapted to Spanish idiom (“consultor brillante” → “consultor de primera” etc.), but overall the intent and purpose are preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are present: pre‑entrenamiento, transfert learning, fine‑tuning vs ICL, the temporary vs permanent knowledge distinction, and the explanation of the “memoria” feature. No significant content is omitted, and the length matches the source.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation transmits the essential information and maintains the structure of the original podcast script. Nevertheless, it suffers from several linguistic inaccuracies and unnatural expressions that would distract a native Spanish audience. A revision focusing on idiomatic phrasing, correct gender agreement, and precise technical wording would raise the quality substantially.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14/20."
