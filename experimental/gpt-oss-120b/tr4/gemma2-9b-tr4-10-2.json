  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. Minor issues such as occasional long sentences and the retention of the French podcast name at the end do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few word choices feel odd for native speakers: \"afianzamiento\" for \"fine‑tuning\" is uncommon (\"ajuste fino\" would be expected), and \"ancrado\" is a literal borrowing instead of the usual \"anclado\". Some phrasing is slightly literal (e.g., \"ventana de contexto\" is fine, but \"mecanismo de ventana de contexto\" would be redundant). Overall, the flow is good but not perfectly idiomatic.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely preserved: pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, ICL, grounding, etc. However, inconsistency appears with \"afianzamiento\" versus the earlier correct \"ajuste fino\". The term \"grounding\" is rendered as \"ancrado\", which is understandable but not the standard Spanish equivalent. Consistency could be improved.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original intent well for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogy of a consultant and a bike‑riding skill works in Spanish. Keeping the original French podcast title at the final line is acceptable and does not distort the message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as the source. Minor lexical choices do not affect the conveyed facts.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. Readability and completeness are strong points. Fluency and terminology suffer from a few non‑idiomatic choices and inconsistencies, especially around \"fine‑tuning\" and \"grounding\". With minor adjustments to those terms, the text would read like a native‑speaker script.\nOverall quality: good but with room for improvement in naturalness and term consistency.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20.\n\nScore: 16"
