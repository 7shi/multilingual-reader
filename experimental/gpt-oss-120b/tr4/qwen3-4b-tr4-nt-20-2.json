  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences convey the original meaning, and the technical concepts are explained clearly. However, there are a few typographical errors (e.g., “posibla” instead of “posible”) and minor agreement issues (“las conocimientos”) that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several awkward constructions and grammar slips betray a non‑native feel: “las conocimientos”, “Usted ha entendido todo.”, missing opening inverted exclamation marks, and occasional over‑formal address. These reduce the fluidity for a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled. Core AI vocabulary such as “preentrenamiento”, “afinado”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, and the acronym ICL are correctly rendered. The term “prompt” is left untranslated, which is acceptable in this context. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral and the adaptation fits a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor literal translations (e.g., “Es una astucia?”) are acceptable, though a smoother alternative could be used.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the structure mirrors the original, keeping the episode flow intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is accurate and conveys the full meaning of the original podcast. It demonstrates a solid grasp of the technical subject matter and adapts well to a Spanish‑speaking audience. The main drawbacks are typographical and grammatical slips that affect readability and naturalness. With a careful proofread to fix these minor errors, the text would be of high quality.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
