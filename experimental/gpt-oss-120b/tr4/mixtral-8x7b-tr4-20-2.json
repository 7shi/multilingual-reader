  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. However, the frequent parenthetical notes about pronunciation interrupt the flow and can confuse readers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly sounds natural, but there are several awkward constructions (e.g., repeated \"¡Claro.\", over‑use of exclamation marks, and literal renderings like \"pre‑entrainement\"). These reduce the smoothness for native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are correctly rendered and used consistently throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast opening and cultural tone well (e.g., \"¡Hola y bienvenidos!\"). The only drawback is the unnecessary pronunciation notes, which are not needed for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is retained. No relevant detail is omitted, and the added parenthetical explanations do not alter the original meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation conveys the original content accurately and uses appropriate technical terminology. Readability and completeness are strong, but fluency suffers from several clunky phrasings and superfluous pronunciation annotations. With a smoother, more natural style and removal of the parenthetical pronunciation notes, the translation would reach a higher quality level.\n\n**Total score (out of 100): 84**\n\n**Breakdown:** 16 (readability) + 14 (fluency) + 18 (terminology) + 16 (contextual adaptation) + 20 (information completeness) = **84**."
