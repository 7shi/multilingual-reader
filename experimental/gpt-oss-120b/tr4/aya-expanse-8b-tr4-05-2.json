    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the flow mirrors the original French dialogue. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained clearly. Minor issues (a typo \"conoscencias\" and the occasional missing opening/closing punctuation) slightly hinder smooth reading but do not obstruct comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native Spanish speaker in most places. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and the conversational tone is preserved. A few expressions feel slightly off or literal (e.g., \"hacer trampa en un examen\" instead of \"cram\", \"afilado\" for fine‑tuning, and the use of \"vuestras\" which is more Iberian), and the typo \"conoscencias\" breaks fluency briefly. Overall, fluency is high but not perfect.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\" / \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje\". Consistency is good, though \"afilado\" is a false friend for fine‑tuning and could cause confusion. Nevertheless, the core terminology is well‑handled.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately. The analogy with a consultant and the discussion of memory features are conveyed clearly. The only questionable adaptation is the shift from \"bachoter\" (cramming) to \"hacer trampa\" (cheating), which slightly changes the nuance. Overall, the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is preserved. Minor typographical errors and the occasional missing punctuation do not constitute loss of information. Redundancy is minimal.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation from French to Spanish is of high quality. It successfully conveys the technical content and the conversational style of the podcast, with clear explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning. Minor typographical errors (e.g., \"conoscencias\"), a few less‑natural word choices (\"afilado\", \"hacer trampa\"), and occasional punctuation slips prevent a perfect score, but they do not significantly impair understanding. With a quick proofread to fix the typos and adjust the few awkward phrases, the translation would be excellent."
