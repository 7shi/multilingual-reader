  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and the concepts are explained in a way that most readers can follow. However, the opening mixes French (“Bonjour”) with Spanish and there are occasional register shifts (e.g., “usted” vs. “tú”) that can momentarily confuse the reader.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally, but there are several awkward spots: duplicated speaker tag “Luc: Luc:”, the use of “Podéis” (vosotros) in a text that otherwise uses “tú”, and phrases like “una forma astucia de aprendizaje”. These reduce the overall smoothness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology (pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding, etc.) is correctly rendered and consistently used. Minor issues such as missing quotation marks around some English terms do not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and purpose of the original podcast are preserved, and the translation adapts the material to a Spanish‑speaking audience. The mixed‑language greeting and occasional formal‑informal inconsistencies detract slightly from a fully localized version.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version; no ideas are omitted or incorrectly added.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original content accurately and retains the technical depth. The main weaknesses are stylistic – inconsistent pronouns, a few unnatural phrasings, and a mixed‑language opening. A polish focusing on uniform register and smoother phrasing would bring the translation to a higher level of professionalism.\n\nOverall score (out of 20): 17"
