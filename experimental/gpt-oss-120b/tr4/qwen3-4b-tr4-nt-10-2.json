    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the logical flow of the original dialogue. Most sentences convey the intended meaning, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a lay‑reader can follow. However, there are occasional awkward constructions (e.g., \"esta enfoque\", \"del bachotaje\", \"el afinan un modelo\") that slightly disrupt the smooth reading experience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several non‑native expressions, grammatical mismatches, and typographical errors that make it sound stilted. Examples include gender agreement problems (\"esta enfoque\" instead of \"este enfoque\"), verb conjugation mistakes (\"el afinan\"), and unusual phraseology (\"del bachotaje\"). While a native speaker would understand the content, the wording does not feel fully natural.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\" becomes \"afinado\", \"transfer learning\" is \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\", etc. Consistency is good and the chosen vocabulary matches the target audience (tech‑savvy podcast listeners). A few minor issues (e.g., \"memoria de uso único\" could be \"memoria de un solo uso\") do not impair comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the informal podcast tone and the analogies (consultant, bicycle, etc.). Nevertheless, some cultural‑linguistic tweaks are missing or mis‑rendered (e.g., \"subir a la silla\" for riding a bike, \"del bachotaje\" instead of a more natural \"como estudiar a último momento\"). The overall intent is preserved, but the adaptation could be smoother.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original script is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the dialogue structure is retained. Minor stylistic redundancies appear (repetition of \"precisamente\"), but they do not affect completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full meaning of the original French podcast and retains the technical depth required for the audience. Strengths lie in accurate terminology and faithful transmission of ideas. Weaknesses are mainly in fluency and naturalness: several grammatical slips and awkward phrasing make the text feel less like native Spanish and more like a literal rendering. Improving verb agreement, gender consistency, and choosing more idiomatic expressions would raise the overall quality considerably."
