  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow and conveys the ideas clearly. Sentence structures are logical and the flow mirrors the original. Minor issues such as \"entre bambalinas\" (instead of the more common \"entre bastidores\") and occasional literal phrasing do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most of the text. Vocabulary is appropriate and the dialogue reads like a podcast script. A few expressions feel slightly literal (e.g., \"ventana de discusión\" instead of \"ventana de chat\"), but overall the language is smooth.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\", \"anclaje\" and \"prompt\" are all used consistently. The translation respects the specialized vocabulary expected by a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original podcast are preserved. The translation adapts cultural references (e.g., \"consultor brillante\") appropriately. The only slight mismatch is the use of \"entre bambalinas\", which is understandable but not the most idiomatic choice.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary material. The core concepts and examples remain intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and maintains the conversational style of the podcast. Minor lexical choices (e.g., \"entre bambalinas\", \"ventana de discusión\") prevent it from being perfect, but they do not affect the reader’s understanding. The work demonstrates solid competence in both language and subject matter.\n\nScore breakdown: 17 (readability) + 16 (fluency) + 18 (terminology) + 17 (contextual adaptation) + 20 (information completeness) = 88/100.\n\nTo reach a higher level, replace less idiomatic phrases with more common equivalents (e.g., \"entre bastidores\", \"ventana de chat\") and smooth out a few literal constructions.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 88"
