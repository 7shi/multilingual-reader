  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally easy to understand. Sentences are mostly logical and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are clear. A few sentences are quite long, which can slightly hinder flow, but the overall comprehension is good.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds mostly natural, but there are several literal renderings that feel awkward to native speakers. Examples include \"AICL (Aprendizaje In‑Contextual)\" (an uncommon phrasing), \"ventana de contexto\" (acceptable but less idiomatic than \"ventana de contexto\" or \"contexto ampliado\"), and occasional over‑formal constructions such as \"el modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona\". These issues lower the overall smoothness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly correctly translated (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, memoria a corto plazo). However, the choice of \"afinamiento\" for \"fine‑tuning\" is not the most common Spanish term (\"ajuste fino\" is preferred). The acronym ICL is rendered as \"AICL (Aprendizaje In‑Contextual)\", which may confuse readers and breaks consistency with the original abbreviation. Overall the terminology is understandable but not optimal.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogies (consultor brillante, aprender a montar en bicicleta) work well in Spanish. Minor phrasing choices could be refined, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant details are omitted, and the structure follows the original closely. The translation also avoids unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the content accurately and retains the educational tone of the original podcast. Readability and completeness are strong points. Fluency and terminology could be improved by using more idiomatic Spanish expressions and standard technical equivalents (e.g., \"ajuste fino\" for fine‑tuning, keeping the acronym ICL). With these refinements, the translation would feel more natural to native Spanish speakers while maintaining technical precision."
