  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand. Sentences follow a logical order and complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained clearly. A few minor phrasing quirks do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are occasional awkward constructions (e.g., \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotage\" and the use of \"Y yo soy Luc\"). Overall, a native Spanish speaker would find it fluid, though not perfectly polished.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is well‑handled: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, transferencia de aprendizaje, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding → anclaje, etc. The only notable lapse is retaining the French word \"bachotage\" instead of a Spanish equivalent like \"memorización intensiva\".",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the podcast format and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., using \"consultor\" instead of \"consultant\"). The intent and tone of the original are preserved.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original script is present; no ideas are omitted or altered. The translation even includes the same examples and analogies, maintaining completeness.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version is a faithful and readable rendering of the French podcast script. It conveys the technical concepts accurately and keeps the conversational tone. Minor issues—most notably the untranslated French term \"bachotage\" and a few slightly stilted phrases—prevent it from being perfect, but they do not detract significantly from the overall quality.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
