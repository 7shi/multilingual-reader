  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the main ideas and is generally understandable. However, several sentences are clunky (e.g., “su proceso de aprendizaje sigue un proceso bien real”, “increímente flexible”) and the redundancy of words makes the flow harder for a Spanish‑speaking listener. The overall comprehension is fine but the reading experience is slightly impeded.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are multiple unnatural word choices and grammatical slips: “el afilado”, “ajuste fine”, “ancraje”, “pañuelo con notas”, the use of \"Lucas\" instead of \"Luc\", and the typo “increímente”. These errors break the natural rhythm expected in a podcast script.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"ICL\" are correctly rendered. Nevertheless, some terms are poorly adapted (\"afilar\" instead of \"afinamiento\" or \"ajuste fino\", \"ancraje\" instead of \"anclaje\"), which can confuse readers familiar with the standard Spanish jargon.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and explanatory tone. It adapts cultural references adequately, but the inconsistent handling of the podcast name (changing to \"Tech Claridad\" then reverting to \"Tech Éclair\") and occasional literal translations (e.g., \"pañuelo con notas\") reduce the overall contextual fit.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the content from the French source is present; no major ideas are omitted. The translator added some parenthetical notes, which do not alter the meaning. The only minor loss is the nuance of the term \"grounding\", which is rendered as \"ancraje\" – a less precise translation – but the overall information remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in transmitting the full message and keeps the technical explanations intact, but it suffers from several linguistic inaccuracies and unnatural word choices that affect fluency and readability. Consistency issues (names, podcast title) and occasional mistranslations of key terminology prevent it from feeling fully polished for a native Spanish audience. With a careful revision of the problematic terms and a smoother phrasing, the quality could be raised substantially."
