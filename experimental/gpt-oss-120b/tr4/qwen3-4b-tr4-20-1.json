  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and the dialogue flow is preserved. However, a few sentences are clunky (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenido en…\", \"está en vía de emergir\") and some punctuation is odd, which can momentarily disrupt comprehension. Overall, a native reader can follow the content without major difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several non‑native constructions and lexical choices that sound unnatural: \"bienvenido en\" instead of \"bienvenido a\", \"antiespuesta\" (a non‑existent word), \"en vía de emergir\", and occasional over‑literal translations. Vocabulary is mostly correct but the phrasing needs polishing for smooth, idiomatic Spanish.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly kept, but some are translated inconsistently: \"fine‑tuning\" becomes \"afinamiento\" (acceptable but less common than \"ajuste fino\"), \"grounding\" is rendered as \"anclaje\" (unusual), and the crucial term \"ventana de contexto\" is omitted entirely. The erroneous \"antiespuesta\" for \"antisèche\" is a clear mistake. Consistency suffers.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and the educational tone of the podcast. Cultural adaptation is adequate, but the missing mention of \"ventana de contexto\" and the awkward phrasing reduce the impact. The overall message (temporary vs permanent knowledge) is conveyed correctly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original information is retained, but the passage that explains the expansion of short‑term memory and the term \"fenêtre de contexte\" is absent. The incorrect translation of \"antisèche\" also removes a precise nuance. These omissions and errors lower completeness slightly.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main ideas of the podcast and is largely understandable, but it suffers from several fluency issues, inaccurate technical terminology, and minor omissions. A native speaker would grasp the content, yet the text feels somewhat literal and occasionally confusing. Improving idiomatic phrasing, correcting the erroneous \"antiespuesta\", and ensuring all key technical terms (especially \"ventana de contexto\") are present would raise the quality substantially.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 72/100."
