  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the dialogue in a clear, logical order. Sentences are mostly short enough for easy comprehension, and the technical ideas are explained with appropriate examples (e.g., the consultant analogy). A few sentences are a bit long, but they do not hinder understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are occasional awkward constructions and minor grammatical slips (e.g., “Este es la realidad del AIL”, “el afinamiento (afinado fino)”, “el AIL” instead of “el ICL”). These do not break comprehension but prevent the text from being fully native‑like.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, etc. The only inconsistency is the abbreviation “AICL” (should be ICL) and the gender error in “Este es la realidad”. Otherwise the terminology is precise and consistent.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the French idioms to Spanish comfortably (e.g., “bagaje general”, “consultor brillante”). Cultural references remain neutral, and the tone of a podcast conversation is preserved. Minor issues with abbreviation aside, the intent and style are well conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No substantive information is lost. All examples, analogies, and explanations from the original are present. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy nor omit key points.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is accurate and largely faithful to the original French script. It communicates the technical concepts clearly and retains the conversational tone of the podcast. Minor grammatical errors, a couple of unnatural phrasing choices, and an incorrect abbreviation prevent it from being perfect, but these issues are limited and do not affect the overall message. The translation would be easily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners familiar with AI topics.\n\nOverall rating (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
