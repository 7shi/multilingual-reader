    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original. Most sentences are understandable, and complex concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can follow. Minor issues such as the duplicated \"Camille: Camille:\" line and the uncommon word \"ancaje\" slightly reduce smoothness, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, but there are a few awkward or overly colloquial expressions (e.g., \"bachatear\", \"una hoja de trucos\"). Some punctuation and phrasing choices are slightly off, and the duplication error is noticeable. Overall, a native speaker would find it mostly fluid but not perfectly polished.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\". Consistency is maintained throughout. The only questionable choice is \"ancaje\" for \"grounding\"; \"anclaje\" would be more usual, but the meaning is still clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content well to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using appropriate idioms and maintaining the original intent. The informal term \"bachatear\" is a bit slangy for a technical podcast but does not distort the message. The duplicated label is a typographical oversight.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the structure mirrors the source. Minor typographic errors do not cause loss of meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and is fairly easy to understand. Technical terminology is handled well, and the core ideas are preserved. Minor typographical glitches, a slightly informal word choice, and a few unnatural phrasing moments keep it from being perfect, but the quality is high and suitable for a general audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nStrengths: faithful rendering of technical content, clear explanations, good consistency of terminology. Areas for improvement: tighten phrasing for more formal tone, correct the duplicate label, consider more common equivalents for \"grounding\" and avoid overly colloquial slang.\n\nScore (out of 100): 85/100."
