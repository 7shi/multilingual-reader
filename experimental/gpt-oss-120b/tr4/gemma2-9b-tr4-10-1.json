  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow; sentences are short and the flow mirrors the original dialogue. Concepts are explained clearly, and the structure is logical. Minor hiccups like the overly formal “Mire usted:” slightly affect smoothness, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation sounds natural, but a few lexical choices feel literal or uncommon. “Afianzamiento” for fine‑tuning and “ancrado” for grounding are not the usual Spanish technical terms (normally “ajuste fino” and “anclaje”). Redundant phrasing such as “aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)” also reduces naturalness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly correct: pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL). However, inconsistency appears with “afianzamiento” instead of the standard “ajuste fino”, and the retention of the French word “ancrado” without a Spanish equivalent. This lowers the appropriateness of terminology.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast’s tone and intent well, preserving the conversational style and the analogy of consultants vs. experts. The title change to “Tech Rayo” is a sensible cultural adaptation. Slightly formal constructions (“Mire usted:”) feel out of place in a casual podcast, but overall the purpose is conveyed.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original script is retained. No major ideas are omitted, and the dialogue remains faithful to the source. Redundancies are minimal and do not affect clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is generally clear and faithful, delivering the technical content in an accessible way. It suffers from a few non‑standard term choices and occasional overly formal phrasing, which prevent it from feeling completely natural to native Spanish speakers. With slight adjustments to terminology (e.g., using “ajuste fino” and “anclaje”) and smoothing formal expressions, the quality would be markedly higher.\nOverall score (out of 100): 76/100.\nThe translation is good but can be refined for greater fluency and terminological consistency."
