    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences are clear, but there are a few awkward mix‑ups such as \"Bonjour y bienvenido\" which momentarily disrupts comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, using appropriate Spanish constructions. Minor issues (e.g., the French‑Spanish blend at the start, occasional literal translations like \"libreta de consulta\") prevent it from being fully native‑like.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding) are correctly rendered and consistently used. The term \"prompt\" is left in English, which is acceptable for a technical audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original podcast are preserved, and cultural references are appropriate for Spanish‑speaking listeners. The only notable lapse is the mixed‑language greeting, which could be fully adapted to Spanish.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present; no ideas are omitted or misrepresented. The translation remains faithful to the source content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is strong and conveys the technical concepts accurately. Minor language mixing and a few literal turns keep it from being perfect, but readability and technical fidelity are high.\n\nStrengths: accurate terminology, complete coverage of the source, clear exposition of complex ideas.\nWeaknesses: occasional non‑native phrasing (e.g., \"Bonjour y bienvenido\") and slight literalness that slightly reduces naturalness.\n\nThe translation would be excellent after a quick proofread to eliminate the mixed‑language intro and smooth a couple of expressions.\n\nScore out of 20 (average): 17.0"
