  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow; sentences are well‑structured and the dialogue format is preserved. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained clearly, making the content accessible to a general audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, with appropriate colloquial phrasing for a podcast. A few minor hiccups (e.g., \"Es pues un truco?\" and the slight redundancy in \"Aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en contexto)\") prevent a perfect score, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"grounding\" are all rendered with standard Spanish equivalents. The terminology is consistent throughout the dialogue.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone and informal podcast style. Cultural references are neutral and appropriate for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor literal renderings (e.g., \"ventana de contexto\") are acceptable in this technical context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is retained. No sections are omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as in the original. Redundancy is minimal and does not affect clarity.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational tone of the podcast, and is largely fluent and readable. A few small stylistic tweaks could raise fluency to perfection, but the translation is fully functional and informative for Spanish‑speaking audiences.\nScore breakdown: readability 18, fluency 17, terminology 19, contextual adaptation 18, information completeness 20, giving a total of 92/100.\nThe translation succeeds in delivering the original message with only minor, non‑critical imperfections.\n\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 92/100.\n"
