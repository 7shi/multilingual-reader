  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original flow, but there are several lexical slips that hurt comprehension. The word “crammar” is not a Spanish term (likely a mistranslation of “bachoter”), and the French loan “antisèche” is left untranslated. These errors can confuse readers, although the surrounding sentences remain clear.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds fairly natural in most places, preserving the conversational podcast tone. However, literal renderings such as “el afinado” for “fine‑tuning” and occasional awkward phrasing (“en una ventana de discusión”) make the prose feel slightly stilted. The occasional punctuation errors (extra spaces before exclamation marks) also detract from fluency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly well‑handled: “preentrenamiento”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, and the use of the original English acronyms are appropriate. The choice of “afinado” for fine‑tuning is understandable but less common than “ajuste fino”. The term “grounding” is correctly introduced with its Spanish equivalent “anclaje”. Overall, terminology is accurate with minor stylistic issues.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the informal, explanatory style suitable for a podcast audience. Cultural adaptation is good except for the untranslated French term “antisèche” and the erroneous “crammar”. These reduce the feeling that the text is fully adapted to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No major ideas are omitted, though the small lexical errors mentioned above slightly affect clarity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main ideas of the original podcast script and generally reads well in Spanish. It succeeds in preserving the educational tone and most technical concepts. The main weaknesses are a few mistranslated or untranslated terms (\"crammar\", \"antisèche\") and some slightly literal phrasing that hampers naturalness. Addressing these would raise the readability and fluency scores substantially.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 14/20."
