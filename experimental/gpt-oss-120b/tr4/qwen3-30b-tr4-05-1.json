  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand and the sentence structures are clear. However, several gaps where whole speaker turns are omitted (especially Luc’s explanations) interrupt the flow and force the reader to infer missing content, which hurts overall comprehensibility.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The language that is present reads naturally and uses appropriate colloquial Spanish. Minor issues such as a duplicated speaker label (\"Camille: Camille\"), occasional punctuation quirks, and the use of guillemets around \"olvidado\" do not seriously affect fluency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje (grounding)\" are correctly translated and consistent. The main drawback is that several technical explanations are missing entirely, so the terminology cannot be judged in those parts.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast style to Spanish well, using familiar expressions and culturally neutral wording. The missing segments reduce the ability to fully convey the original intent, but the parts that are present are appropriately adapted.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A substantial portion of the original dialogue is absent: Luc’s introductory sentence about pre‑training, his detailed explanation of transfer learning, the description of in‑context learning, and several connective remarks are omitted. This results in a loss of crucial information and breaks the logical progression of the episode.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is fluent and uses correct technical terminology, and the parts that are present are culturally and linguistically appropriate. However, the translation is incomplete – whole speaker turns are missing, which leads to loss of key explanations and a fragmented narrative. To be a high‑quality translation, all lines should be rendered, preserving the logical flow and ensuring no information is omitted.\n\n**Final score (average of criteria):** 13.6 / 20"
