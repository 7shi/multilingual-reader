    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear order. Sentences are generally short enough for easy comprehension, and complex concepts are explained with adequate context. Minor hiccups (e.g., occasional overly literal phrasing) do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for native speakers. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic, though a few constructions remain slightly literal (“una nueva aproximación más flexible está emergiendo”, “competencia permanente”). Overall, the language is smooth and pleasant to read.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje (grounding), ventana de contexto, etc. The choices are consistent throughout and match the expected Spanish technical jargon.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The podcast tone is preserved and the translation respects the cultural expectations of Spanish‑speaking listeners. Names, titles and examples are left unchanged where appropriate, and the explanatory style matches the original intent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and dialogues from the French original are present. No content is omitted or added unnecessarily, and the translation remains faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the original message accurately, uses appropriate technical vocabulary, and reads naturally for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but they do not detract from comprehension.\n\nStrengths: faithful rendering of technical concepts, clear structure, consistent terminology. Areas for improvement: smooth out a few literal translations to sound more idiomatic.\n\nThe work would be very well received by listeners of the podcast in Spanish.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
