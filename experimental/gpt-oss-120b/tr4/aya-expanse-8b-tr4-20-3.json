  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the flow of ideas follows the original. However, there are several awkward constructions (e.g., “las informaciones”, “subes al caballo (se entiende “bicicleta”)”) and a few minor typographical issues that may momentarily confuse the reader. These reduce the overall ease of comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several non‑native expressions and literal renderings that feel stiff. Phrases such as “hacer trampa en un examen” for “bachoter” are acceptable, but others like “las informaciones” and the parenthetical “(se entiende “bicicleta”)” sound unnatural. The overall smoothness is therefore moderate.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms (preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, anclaje, ventana de contexto, prompt) are kept or correctly translated, and the usage is consistent throughout the text.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and maintains the explanatory tone suitable for a podcast audience. Some cultural‑linguistic choices (e.g., changing the podcast name to “Tech Luz”, the confusing “caballo” analogy) slightly detract from the adaptation, but the core message remains clear.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French source are present, and no substantive information is lost. Minor issues such as the altered podcast title at the end and the odd parenthetical note do not affect factual completeness, but they introduce a small amount of redundancy and potential confusion.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content and the conversational style of the podcast. It succeeds in preserving the structure and most of the nuance, but occasional literalness and awkward phrasing prevent it from feeling fully natural to a native Spanish speaker. The handling of terminology is strong, while readability and fluency could be improved with smoother phrasing and removal of confusing parenthetical explanations. The adaptation is mostly faithful, though the change of the podcast name and the ‘caballo/bicicleta’ analogy are unnecessary and slightly confusing. With minor edits, the text would reach a higher level of polish."
