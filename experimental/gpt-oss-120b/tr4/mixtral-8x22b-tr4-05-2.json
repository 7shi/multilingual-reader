    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are generally clear and the flow of ideas mirrors the original script. Minor issues such as very long sentences and occasional repetition do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, but a few expressions feel awkward to native speakers. Examples: \"AIC (Aprendizaje In-Context)\" mixes English and Spanish, \"el afinamiento\" is less common than \"ajuste fino\", and the ending title \"Tech Iluminado\" diverges from the earlier \"Tecno Flash\". These choices break the smoothness slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding, etc. The only notable inconsistency is the acronym: the original uses ICL (In‑Context Learning) but the translation introduces AIC (Aprendizaje In‑Context), which may confuse readers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish well, using appropriate colloquialisms and keeping the educational style. The only drawback is the inconsistent naming of the podcast at the end (\"Tech Iluminado\" instead of \"Tecno Flash\"), which slightly weakens brand continuity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is retained. No concepts are omitted, and the explanations remain intact. The translation even adds a clarifying parenthetical for \"grounding\".",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is very solid. It conveys the original content accurately and in a way that Spanish‑speaking listeners can understand. The main weaknesses are minor lexical choices (e.g., \"afinamiento\", \"AIC\") and a small inconsistency in the podcast title. Fixing these would bring the translation to near‑perfect fluency and terminology handling.\n\nRating: 18/20 overall.\n\nRecommendations: replace \"el afinamiento\" with \"ajuste fino\", use the standard acronym ICL (aprendizaje en contexto), keep the podcast name consistent, and avoid mixing English terms inside Spanish parentheses.\n\nScore: 18"
