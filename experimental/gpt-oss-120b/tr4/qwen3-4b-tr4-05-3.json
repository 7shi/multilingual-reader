  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but there are several awkward constructions and grammatical slips (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en…”, “Voy.” for “Je vois.”, “las conocencias”). These hinder smooth comprehension for native readers, especially when the discussion involves abstract concepts like pre‑training and in‑context learning.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound unnatural or contain outright errors: “apretar” instead of a term for “bachotage”, “conocencias” (non‑existent word), missing prepositions, and literal translations that do not flow in Spanish. The overall rhythm is choppy, indicating low fluency.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, and “ICL” are correctly retained or translated. However, occasional misuse of words (“apretar”, “conocencias”) and inconsistent hyphenation reduce the precision of the terminology.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent, but several expressions are overly literal or culturally odd (e.g., “consultante temporal” instead of “consultor temporal”, “Hola y bienvenido en”). The adaptation could be smoother to match typical Spanish podcast language.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French script are present; no sections are omitted. The only drawbacks are the inaccurate word choices that slightly distort meaning (e.g., “apretar” for “bachotage”). Overall the information is complete.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the overall structure and content of the original podcast, but it suffers from numerous linguistic inaccuracies and awkward phrasing that affect readability and naturalness. Technical terminology is mostly handled well, yet some mistranslations (e.g., “apretar”, “conocencias”) undermine clarity. A revision focusing on idiomatic Spanish, correct vocabulary, and smoother sentence flow would substantially improve the quality.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 12/20."
