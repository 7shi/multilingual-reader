  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original. Most sentences are easy to understand, and complex concepts are explained with appropriate examples. Minor issues such as duplicated speaker tags (\"Luc: Luc:\") and occasional punctuation errors slightly disrupt the reading experience, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally, using appropriate Spanish constructions for most parts. However, there are a few awkward or non‑Spanish expressions (e.g., \"el bachotage\", \"Luc: Luc:\"), occasional missing accents, and some literal renderings that feel stiff. These reduce the overall smoothness for a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"grounding\", etc. The translator keeps the English acronyms where appropriate and provides Spanish equivalents when needed. The only notable slip is the retention of the French word \"bachotage\" instead of a Spanish equivalent, which could confuse readers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose of the podcast. Examples are adapted well (e.g., \"consultor brillante\"), and cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor typographical repetitions do not affect the overall message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the logical sequence is maintained. The only loss is superficial (duplicate labels), which does not alter content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the technical content accurately and is understandable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. It succeeds in preserving the podcast’s explanatory style and educational goal. The main weaknesses are a few unnatural lexical choices (notably the French term \"bachotage\"), some duplicated speaker tags, and occasional punctuation/accent errors. Addressing these would raise fluency and readability to a near‑native level.\n\n**Total score:** 80/100 (average 16/20 per criterion). The translation is good, but with room for polishing to achieve full native fluency and consistency.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Replace \"bachotage\" with a Spanish equivalent such as \"repaso intensivo\" or \"estudio de última hora\".\n- Remove duplicated speaker identifiers.\n- Review punctuation and accent marks for consistency.\n- Perform a final proofread to catch minor typographical slips.\n\nThese adjustments would likely bring the overall rating above 90/100."
