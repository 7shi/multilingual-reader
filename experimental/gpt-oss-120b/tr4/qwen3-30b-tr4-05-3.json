  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text can be followed for the parts that are present, but large sections of the dialogue are missing (several of Luc’s turns are omitted, a line repeats \"Camille:\" twice, and some transitions are abrupt). This breaks the flow and forces the reader to guess the missing content, reducing overall comprehensibility.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "When the translation is present it is generally understandable, but there are many literal renderings and awkward constructions (e.g., \"ventana de contexto\" instead of the more common \"ventana de contexto\" is okay, but \"consultor temporal\" feels forced, and \"el modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona\" is a bit clunky). The missing parts also make the conversation feel disjointed.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\". However, occasional inconsistencies appear (\"preentrenamiento\" vs \"pre‑entrenamiento\") and some English acronyms are left unexplained. Overall, the terminology that is present is appropriate.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original tone and intent, but cultural adaptation is limited. Certain expressions (e.g., \"consultor brillante\") are kept literal, which is acceptable, yet the omission of several key sentences undermines the faithful conveyance of the original message.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Significant portions of the original dialogue are absent: Luc’s introductory explanation after \"Luc:\" is missing, several explanatory turns are omitted, and a duplicate \"Camille:\" line appears. This results in loss of crucial information about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and memory features, making the translation incomplete.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the gist of the conversation where it exists and handles most technical vocabulary adequately. However, it is far from complete: large chunks of the original script are missing, and the existing Spanish text contains several awkward phrasings and minor inconsistencies. To be usable for Spanish‑speaking listeners, the missing sections need to be added and the flow refined for naturalness.\n\nOverall quality is low to moderate, primarily due to incompleteness rather than mistranslation of the content that is present.\n\nOverall Score (out of 20): 8"
