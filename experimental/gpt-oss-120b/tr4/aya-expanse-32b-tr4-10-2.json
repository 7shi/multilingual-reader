  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows smoothly and the sentences are clear and well‑structured. Complex ideas such as transfer learning, in‑context learning and fine‑tuning are explained in simple language that a non‑specialist listener can follow. The occasional short interjections (e.g., \"Mira esto\", \"¡Exacto!\") keep the conversational tone natural for a podcast format.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads like a native‑speaker script. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, and idiomatic expressions (\"chuleta\", \"una antisèche\" equivalent) fit the informal tone. There are no grammatical errors or awkward constructions. The only very minor point is the switch between \"ajuste fino\" and \"afinado\", but it does not break fluency.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL), and \"grounding\" rendered as \"anclaje\". The explanation of each concept is preserved. The use of \"afinado\" for \"affinage\" is slightly less common than \"ajuste fino\", but the meaning remains clear. Overall terminology is accurate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references and the podcast’s informal style well. Phrases such as \"como contratar a un consultor brillante\" and \"chuleta\" make the content relatable for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The only small critique is that the final episode title is left in French (\"Tech Éclair\"), which may feel inconsistent with the earlier translation to \"Tech Relámpago\", but this does not impair understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original script is present: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning, the analogy of temporary vs permanent knowledge, and the explanation of the new \"Memory\" feature. No significant content is omitted, and the structure mirrors the source dialogue closely.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality. It faithfully conveys the technical content while keeping the conversational, podcast‑like tone. Readability and fluency are excellent, technical terminology is largely consistent, and cultural adaptation makes the dialogue feel natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor points—such as the occasional switch in terminology for \"fine‑tuning\" and the mixed use of the original French podcast title—prevent a perfect score, but they do not detract from the overall effectiveness of the translation."
