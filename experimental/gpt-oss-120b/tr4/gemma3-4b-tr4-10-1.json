  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original flow, but several typographical repetitions (e.g., “Camille: Camille:”, “Luc: Luc:”) and occasional grammatical slips such as “Las conocimientos” interrupt smooth reading. The concepts are explained, yet the occasional clumsy phrasing slightly reduces comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many literal renderings and awkward constructions (“El aprendizaje en contexto, es bachorear”, “El ajuste fino… es como enviar a este graduado que siga una especialización”). The duplicated speaker tags and minor agreement errors make the prose feel less natural to a native speaker.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is largely well‑handled: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”, “anclaje”. The term “prompt” is left unchanged, which is acceptable in current AI jargon. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent, tone, and analogies (consultant, bicycle, etc.). Minor cultural adjustments are unnecessary, but the repeated speaker labels and a few overly literal phrases slightly diminish the adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present; no substantive content is omitted. The only issues are typographical (duplicate lines) and minor grammatical errors, which do not affect the conveyed facts.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job transmitting the technical content and overall narrative of the podcast. However, it suffers from mechanical copy‑and‑paste artifacts (duplicate speaker tags) and occasional grammatical inaccuracies that affect readability and naturalness. Technical terms are well translated, and the meaning is preserved, but the text would benefit from careful proofreading and slight re‑phrasing to improve fluency.\nOverall score reflects a competent but imperfect rendering.\nScore: 15/20."
