    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clearly presented. Most sentences are well‑structured and the dialogue flow is preserved. The main drawback is the use of the uncommon word *afianzamiento* for “fine‑tuning”, which can momentarily confuse readers, but the surrounding context usually clarifies the meaning.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in many places (e.g., *imagínese que se envía una IA…*, *Es como contratar a un consultor brillante*). However, there are several awkward turns: *Vea usted*, *el aprendizaje en contexto, o AIL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)* (the original acronym is ICL), and occasional overly formal constructions that sound stiff for a podcast. These issues prevent full fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly correct: *preentrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *grounding* rendered as *anclaje*. The critical errors are the mistranslation of *fine‑tuning* as *afianzamiento* (the standard term is *ajuste fino*) and the wrong acronym *AIL* instead of *ICL*. Consistency suffers, lowering the score.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone, and most cultural references are neutral, so they transfer well. Some expressions remain literal French‑style (e.g., *Mire usted*), and the non‑standard term *afianzamiento* feels out of place for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Nonetheless, the overall message is conveyed appropriately.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key points from the original dialogue are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, temporary vs permanent knowledge, and the “memory” feature. No major content is omitted; only minor inaccuracies (ICL/AIL) are noted, which do not remove information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the podcast’s educational content. It is understandable and mostly faithful, but it suffers from a few lexical choices that feel unnatural in Spanish and from inconsistent handling of technical terminology (especially the fine‑tuning term and the ICL acronym). Fixing these terminology issues and smoothing the occasional stiff phrasing would raise the translation to a near‑native level.\nOverall score (sum of the five criteria): 75/100."
