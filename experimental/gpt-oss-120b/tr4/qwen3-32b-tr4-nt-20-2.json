  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is easy to understand. Sentences are well‑structured and the explanations of concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento o aprendizaje en contexto are clear. Minor punctuation quirks (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido a …”) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the text sounds natural to a native speaker. A few expressions are slightly awkward (e.g., “le enviamos una nueva IA”, “Gracias por haber nos escuchado”), but they do not break the flow. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well‑handled: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, anclaje, etc. The main inconsistency is the acronym “AIC (In-Context Learning)”, which should be ICL. Some terms (e.g., “afinamiento” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”) are acceptable but less standard.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately. The dialogue tone is preserved and the examples are understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic choices could be smoother, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the logical progression of the conversation is maintained. Small grammatical slips do not affect the completeness of the content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality, conveying the technical discussion clearly and naturally. It succeeds in making the complex topic accessible to Spanish listeners. The main weaknesses are a couple of minor phrasing issues and an incorrect acronym for In‑Context Learning. With a small polish these would be resolved, but as it stands the translation is very solid.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
