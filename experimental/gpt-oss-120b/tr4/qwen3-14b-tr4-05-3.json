    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje y aprendizaje en contexto are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. Minor issues (e.g., occasional long sentences, the use of the English word *prompt* without explanation) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several literal calques and mixed‑language choices that feel slightly awkward to a native speaker. Examples: «fine‑tuning» rendered as «afinación» (the more common term is *ajuste fino*), the retention of *prompt* and *ICL* without adaptation, and phrasing like «el modelo mismo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus discusiones». These quirks reduce the smoothness of the prose.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is generally handled correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto* are appropriate. However, consistency suffers with the translation of *fine‑tuning* and the occasional retention of English terms (*prompt*, *ICL*) that could have been fully Spanish‑ified. The term *anclaje (grounding)* is acceptable but could be clarified further.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue and adapts cultural references appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The conversational style is retained, and idiomatic Spanish is used in most places. A few literal translations (e.g., «memorización» instead of a more natural «función de memoria») slightly detract from full adaptation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas, examples, or analogies have been omitted, and the structure mirrors the original script closely. The translation therefore scores full points for completeness.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and is largely readable, but it suffers from occasional literal renderings and inconsistent handling of key technical terms. While the meaning is intact and the dialogue flows well enough for a podcast audience, a more careful localization of jargon (e.g., using *ajuste fino* instead of *afinación*, fully translating *prompt*, and smoothing out a few stiff phrases) would raise the fluency and terminology scores. Overall, it is a solid translation that could be polished for a native‑speaker audience."
