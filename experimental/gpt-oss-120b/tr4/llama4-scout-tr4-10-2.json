  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is easy to follow and the sentences are generally well‑structured. Complex ideas such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinado y aprendizaje en contexto are explained clearly. Minor hiccups (e.g., “Entendido todo.”) slightly affect flow but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. A few phrasing choices are a bit literal (“Más bien, vean:” or “Entendido todo.”) and there is a small repetition of “Aprendizaje en contexto”. Overall, the translation reads smoothly to native speakers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently handled: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL”, “anclaje (grounding)”. The decision to keep “prompt” in English is acceptable in a technical context. No important term is mistranslated or omitted.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts expressions to Spanish‑speaking listeners (e.g., “consultor brillante”). Cultural references are neutral, so no misunderstandings arise. Slightly literal renderings exist but they do not hinder the message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No sentences or ideas are lost, and the explanation of the “memoria” feature is fully retained. Redundancy is minimal and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains readable and mostly fluent, and respects the original tone of the podcast. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve naturalness, but they do not detract from the overall effectiveness of the translation.\n\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 90/100."
