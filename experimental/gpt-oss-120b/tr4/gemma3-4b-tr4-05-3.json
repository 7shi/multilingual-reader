  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but there are several distracting issues that hurt readability. Speaker labels are duplicated (e.g., \"Camille: Camille:\"), and some sentences are oddly phrased (e.g., \"La diferencia entre chismear para un examen y dominar realmente un tema\"). These mistakes force the reader to pause and re‑interpret, reducing the smooth flow of the dialogue.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly uses correct grammar, but many literal renderings and awkward constructions make it sound stilted. Phrases such as \"Vea más bien\" and \"Lo olvida todo\" are not idiomatic in Spanish. The duplicated speaker tags and occasional misuse of words (e.g., \"chismear\" instead of \"bachotear\") further impair naturalness.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are correctly translated and consistently used. However, the term \"bachotage\" is left in French and the word \"chismear\" is an inaccurate translation of \"bachoter\", showing a lack of precise terminology in that spot.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and maintains the pedagogical tone, but cultural and linguistic adaptation is uneven. Some literal translations (e.g., \"consultor brillante\" works, but \"chismear para un examen\" is culturally inappropriate). The duplicated labels and minor errors also distract from the intended message.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of simulated memory features. No major content is omitted, though a few nuances are slightly altered by mistranslations (e.g., \"bachoter\" → \"chismear\").",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation captures the structure and most of the technical content of the original podcast script, but it suffers from several stylistic and lexical errors that affect readability and naturalness. Duplicate speaker tags, occasional misuse of words, and a few literal‑translation artifacts prevent it from feeling like a polished, native‑speaker Spanish script. With careful proofreading and refinement of awkward phrases, the quality could be raised substantially."
