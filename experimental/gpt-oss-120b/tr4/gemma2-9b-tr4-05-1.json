  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the concepts clearly and the sentence flow is generally logical. Most sentences are easy to follow, and the dialogue format is preserved. Minor issues such as occasional long sentences and the use of “afianzamiento” instead of a more common term slightly affect smooth reading.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, but there are a few awkward expressions (“fundamentación” for “grounding”, “afianzamiento” for “fine‑tuning”, “una pista justo antes de que empezara a hablar contigo”). These choices sound a bit stilted to native speakers, though they do not break comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly correct (pre‑entrenamiento, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL). However, the translation of “fine‑tuning” as “afianzamiento” and “grounding” as “fundamentación” are non‑standard; the usual terms are “ajuste fino” and “anclaje”. This inconsistency may confuse readers familiar with the field.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original podcast are well preserved. Cultural references are neutral, and the conversational style fits a Spanish‑speaking audience. The few non‑idiomatic terms noted above slightly reduce the adaptation quality.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No major information is omitted, and the examples (e.g., English‑to‑French transfer) are retained. The translation is concise without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and effectively communicates the technical discussion to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Readability and completeness are strong, but the choice of some technical terms and occasional awkward phrasing prevent it from being fully native‑like. Replacing “afianzamiento” with “ajuste fino” and “fundamentación” with “anclaje” would markedly improve the quality.\n\nScore out of 20: 17 (average of the individual criteria). The translation is good, but there is room for refinement in terminology and fluency.\n\nOverall score (average): 84/100 → 17/20."
