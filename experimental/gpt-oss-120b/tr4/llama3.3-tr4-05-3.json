  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the logical flow of the podcast dialogue is preserved. Minor issues such as occasional long sentences do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are a few grammatical slips (e.g., \"Esta funciones\" instead of \"Estas funciones\", inconsistent capitalization of \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\"). Some phrasing is slightly stiff, yet a native speaker would understand without effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately rendered: pre‑training → \"preentrenamiento\", fine‑tuning → \"afinamiento\", transfer learning → \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", ICL → \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\", grounding → \"anclaje\". Terminology is consistent throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural references are neutral, and analogies (consultant, bicycle) are kept intact, making the content appropriate for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No relevant details are omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does an excellent job conveying the technical discussion in a clear, accessible manner. Terminology is well‑handled and the core message is preserved. Minor grammatical errors and occasional unnatural phrasing prevent a perfect score, but they do not affect overall understanding.\nOverall quality is high and suitable for a podcast audience.\nScore: 91/100 (sum of the five criteria)."
