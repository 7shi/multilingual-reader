  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the logical flow of the podcast dialogue is preserved. Minor issues such as duplicated speaker tags (e.g., \"Camille: Camille:\") and a few redundant words slightly disrupt smooth reading, but they do not hinder comprehension of the technical content.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward spots: the use of the French word \"bachotage\" instead of a Spanish equivalent, occasional repetition of \"Luc: Luc:\" and \"Camille: Camille:\", and a few literal translations that feel stiff (e.g., \"ventana de contexto\" is acceptable, but \"expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo\" feels clunky). These reduce the overall fluidity for a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled very well. Key terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"grounding\" are correctly translated or retained with clear explanations. Consistency across the transcript is maintained.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and podcast format, making it appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are unchanged, which is suitable because the content is technical and universal. Minor awkward phrasing does not affect the conveyed message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the technical explanations remain intact. The only drawbacks are the duplicated speaker labels, which are redundant but not loss of information.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the technical concepts clearly. Terminology is spot‑on, and the complete information is retained. Fluency and readability suffer slightly due to duplicated tags and a few non‑native expressions, but these issues are relatively minor. The text would benefit from a final proofreading pass to remove repetitions and replace the French loanword \"bachotage\" with a proper Spanish term (e.g., \"estudio intensivo\" or \"memorización\").\n\nConsidering the strengths in terminology and completeness, and the moderate weaknesses in fluency and readability, the translation is solid but not perfect.\n\nScore out of 100: 89/100 (average of the five criteria)."
