  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured, and complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) are explained in a way that a non‑expert can grasp. Minor hiccups (e.g., a few long sentences) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural. Vocabulary is appropriate and the podcast tone is maintained. A few expressions feel slightly forced (e.g., “una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”, “una antisèche”), but overall the flow is smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\". Consistency is kept throughout the dialogue.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content well for a Spanish‑speaking audience, preserving the informal podcast style. The only notable cultural slip is the retention of the French word \"antisèche\" instead of a Spanish equivalent like \"chuleta\".",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present. No ideas are omitted, and no unnecessary repetitions were introduced.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical concepts accurately and keeps the conversational tone of the podcast. Minor lexical choices (e.g., the use of \"antisèche\") prevent it from being perfect, but they do not substantially affect understanding. The translation would be well received by Spanish‑speaking listeners interested in AI topics.\nOverall score: 18/20 (average of the five criteria)."
