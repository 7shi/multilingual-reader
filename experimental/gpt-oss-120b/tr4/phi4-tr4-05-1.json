  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original script. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑expert can follow. A few sentences are a little wordy (e.g., “Aprendizaje en Contexto, o AICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”) but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation sounds natural, but there are several awkward or literal renderings: “afinado fino” for “fine‑tuning”, the inconsistent acronym “AIL” instead of “ICL/AICL”, and occasional redundancy (“Aprendizaje en Contexto, o AICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”). These issues make the text feel slightly stilted for a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly (preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, anclaje, prompt). However, the translation of “fine‑tuning” as “afinado fino” is unconventional, and the acronyms shift from ICL → AICL → AIL, creating inconsistency. The term “memoria a corto plazo” is accurate, but the mixed use of English and Spanish for “prompt” could have been noted.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator kept the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogy of a consultant is well adapted (“consultor”). Minor phrasing issues do not affect the overall message, so the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the examples (English‑French transfer, memory feature) are fully retained. The only loss is the slight confusion caused by the wrong acronym, which is a terminology issue rather than missing content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and is largely easy to understand. It succeeds in preserving the educational tone of the podcast. The main weaknesses are inconsistent terminology (especially the handling of the ICL acronym) and a few unnatural phrasing choices such as “afinado fino”. With a bit of polishing these issues would disappear, resulting in a more fluid and professionally sounding text.\nOverall score: 16/20."
