  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable, but large gaps (empty speaker lines) interrupt the flow and force the reader to infer missing information. The remaining sentences are mostly clear, yet occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., “en silla” instead of “en la bicicleta”) slightly hampers smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "When text is present it mostly reads naturally, but the translation contains several unnatural constructions, missing verbs, and literal translations that feel stiff (“una antisèche”, “en silla”). The absence of whole utterances also breaks the natural rhythm of a dialogue.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, and “ICL” are correctly rendered and consistently used. However, a few terms are omitted (e.g., “ventana de contexto”) and some French‑origin words are left untranslated, which slightly reduces precision.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast conversation, and cultural references are appropriate for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Nevertheless, missing passages mean that parts of the original nuance and explanatory depth are lost, weakening the overall adaptation.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A significant portion of the original dialogue is absent (multiple speaker lines are blank, and some explanatory sentences are omitted). This results in loss of key examples and explanations, making the Spanish version incomplete.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the general spirit and most of the technical vocabulary of the original French podcast, but it is far from complete. Large sections of dialogue are missing, and the existing text sometimes sounds literal or slightly awkward. While the terminology is mostly accurate, the gaps and occasional fluency issues reduce its usefulness for a Spanish‑speaking audience. A thorough revision that fills in the omitted content, smooths unnatural phrasing, and ensures consistent terminology would be needed to reach a high‑quality translation level."
