  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in a straightforward way. Sentence structures are logical and the flow of the dialogue mirrors the original. Minor hiccups (e.g., occasional French‑style quotation marks) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, but a few expressions feel out of place for a native speaker: “El afinado” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”, the retention of French terms like «ancrage» and «antisèche», and the use of French guillemets. These create slight awkwardness, though the overall register is appropriate for a tech‑podcast.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto) is handled correctly and consistently. However, some key terms are left untranslated (ancrage, antisèche) and the word “afinado” is not the standard translation for fine‑tuning, which could confuse readers unfamiliar with the French term.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator has adapted the content well to a Spanish‑speaking audience, preserving the podcast tone and explanatory style. Cultural references are minimal, so no major adaptation is needed. The main drawback is the occasional retention of French typographic conventions and terms, which slightly reduces the cultural fit.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original script is present. No ideas are omitted, and the examples (English‑to‑French transfer, consultant analogy, memory feature) are fully retained. The translation is faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the original message effectively. It excels in completeness and clarity, but a few leftover French words and non‑standard lexical choices prevent it from being completely natural for Spanish readers. A final proofread focusing on replacing French terms with their Spanish equivalents would bring the quality to an excellent level.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
