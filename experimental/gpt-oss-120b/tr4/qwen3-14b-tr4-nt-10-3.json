  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas, and complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia and aprendizaje en contexto are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can understand. Minor issues like occasional long sentences slightly reduce flow, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several awkward or inconsistent expressions: mixed use of \"Usted\" and \"tú\", the phrase \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\" (should be \"Lo has entendido todo\"), misplaced spaces before punctuation, and a gender error \"Las nuevas conocimientos\". These errors make the text sound less natural for native speakers, though the meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well handled. \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje\" are correctly translated and consistently used. The only slight drawback is that \"afinado\" is less common than the usual \"ajuste fino\", but the term is understandable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the podcast’s informal, conversational tone and adapts cultural references appropriately. Some formality inconsistencies (mix of \"Usted\" and \"tú\") slightly affect the adaptation, but the overall intent and purpose are preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the structure mirrors the source. Minor punctuation errors do not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content and the lively podcast atmosphere. Terminology is accurate and the ideas are complete, but fluency suffers from several stylistic and grammatical slips, especially regarding pronoun consistency and gender agreement. Improving these aspects would raise the naturalness to a native‑speaker level. Overall, the translation is good and functional, scoring around the high‑mid range.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
