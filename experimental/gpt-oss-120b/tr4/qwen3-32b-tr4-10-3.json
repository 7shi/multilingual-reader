  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and preserves the structure of the original dialogue. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained clearly and remain easy to follow for a non‑specialist audience. Minor punctuation quirks (e.g., missing space after «Mémoire») do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural to a native speaker. Most sentences use idiomatic Spanish, but a few constructions are slightly stiff or unidiomatic (e.g., \"Lo tienes todo claro\", \"Se podría decir\", \"¿Porque\" without the required accent). These do not break the text but prevent a perfect fluency rating.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\" and \"grounding\" are all retained or translated appropriately. Consistency is maintained throughout the dialogue, and no term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the podcast format and the informal conversational tone, adapting cultural references (e.g., “consultor brillante”) smoothly. The only minor lapse is the duplicated speaker tag \"Camille:\" in the Spanish line, but the overall intent and register are preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No sentences or nuances are omitted, and the explanatory examples (English‑to‑French transfer, memory vs. permanent knowledge) are fully retained. Redundancy is not introduced.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, keeps the dialogue lively, and is largely readable and natural for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor typographical and stylistic tweaks (accentuation, smoother phrasing, fixing the duplicated speaker label) would push the score to near‑perfect, but the current version is already very effective for its intended audience."
