  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear order. Most sentences are easy to follow, and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained with relatable analogías. Minor hiccups such as a slightly clunky phrasing in “su espacio de trabajo temporal simplemente ha sido vaciado” do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few literal choices betray the source language (“el afinamiento” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”, mixed use of “tú” and “usted”, and occasional English terms like “prompt” left untranslated). These issues create brief moments of awkwardness, yet a native speaker would still understand without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely preserved and correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding, etc. Consistency is good, though “afinamiento” is less idiomatic than “ajuste fino”, and the occasional untranslated English word could be improved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the target audience, using Spanish‑language examples and cultural references. However, pronoun inconsistency (mixing “tú” and “usted”) and some overly literal renderings reduce the natural cultural adaptation. Overall intent is maintained.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original script is retained. No major ideas are omitted, and the nuances about temporary vs. permanent knowledge, memory tricks, and the consultant analogy are fully conveyed.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the original podcast script into Spanish. It is comprehensible, mostly fluent, and technically accurate, though it could benefit from smoother phrasing, consistent pronoun use, and more idiomatic terminology for fine‑tuning. Minor lexical leftovers from English are the only noticeable blemishes. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
