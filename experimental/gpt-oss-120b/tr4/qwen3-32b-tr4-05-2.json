    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the dialogue flows logically. Most sentences are easy to understand, and the complex ideas about pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑specialist can follow. A few phrases (e.g., “diplomado” for «diplômé», “apuntalar para un examen”) are slightly odd, but they do not block comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several awkward or non‑idiomatic expressions: “aprendizaje memorístico”, “funciones de memorización”, “el afinamiento” (more common would be “ajuste fino”), and occasional syntax that feels literal (“el modelo busca rápidamente en sus intercambios anteriores”). Overall the translation reads as a literal French‑to‑Spanish rendering rather than a fully natural Spanish text.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (In‑Context Learning)”. However, the term “fine‑tuning” is not mentioned, and the word “afinamiento” is less common in Spanish technical literature (\"ajuste fino\" would be preferred). The phrase “aprendizaje memorístico” is not a standard translation for “memorization”.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone and pedagogical style of the podcast. It adapts cultural references (e.g., “consultor brillante”) appropriately. Minor issues arise from literal translations that feel slightly out of place for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but the overall message is conveyed accurately.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key information from the French script is present: description of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No significant content is omitted, and the structure mirrors the original.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content and the conversational tone of the original podcast. It is largely complete and understandable, but it suffers from several non‑idiomatic word choices and a few literal renderings that reduce naturalness. Improving the choice of technical vocabulary (e.g., using \"ajuste fino\" instead of \"afinamiento\") and fixing the mis‑translation of \"bachoter\" would raise the overall quality.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
