  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the main ideas are conveyed, but there are several grammatical slips (e.g., \"las conocimientos\", \"informaciónes\", mixed use of \"Usted\" and \"tú\") and occasional French fragments (\"C’est logique.\") that can confuse readers. The sentence flow is sometimes choppy, which lowers overall comprehensibility.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural expressions and typographical errors (\"Et soyoy Luc\", \"Camille: … Tech Flash … Tech Éclair\"). The mix of French and Spanish within the same sentence, and inconsistent register, makes the prose feel artificial rather than native.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\" and \"grounding\" are correctly rendered and consistently used. Minor issues (e.g., keeping the original podcast name in French) do not significantly affect technical clarity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator generally preserves the original intent, but the inconsistent inclusion of French words and the occasional literal translation of idioms reduce cultural resonance for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Some expressions could have been better localized.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. No substantive content is omitted, only minor stylistic repetitions.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in transmitting the technical content, but its readability and fluency are hampered by grammatical errors, inconsistent language mixing, and occasional awkward phrasing. Terminology is handled well, and the information is complete, yet a more careful edit for natural Spanish would raise the overall quality substantially.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14/20."
