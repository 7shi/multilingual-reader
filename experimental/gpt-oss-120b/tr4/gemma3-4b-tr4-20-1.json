  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clearly conveyed. However, the repeated speaker labels (e.g., “Camille: Camille:”) and occasional overly literal constructions slightly disrupt the flow, requiring the reader to pause.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places and uses appropriate vocabulary. A few sentences feel a bit stiff or literal (e.g., “Imaginen que enviamos una IA totalmente nueva a la escuela…”; duplicated speaker tags) and some punctuation could be smoother, but overall a native‑speaker would understand without effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding/anclaje, etc. The translator kept the jargon consistent and added helpful parenthetical explanations when needed.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the Spanish‑speaking audience, preserving the podcast style and cultural references. Minor issues are the retention of English words such as “prompt” and the duplicated speaker tags, which feel out of place in a Spanish transcript.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present; no substantive content is lost. The only drawbacks are redundant speaker labels and a few typographical quirks, which do not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is faithful and conveys the technical content clearly. It maintains the conversational tone of the podcast and uses appropriate terminology. The main weaknesses are minor repetitions of speaker identifiers, occasional literal phrasing, and a few English borrowings that could be fully localized. These issues do not impede comprehension but prevent the text from reaching a fully polished native level.\n\nThe translation scores well on terminology and completeness, while readability, fluency and contextual adaptation are good but leave room for improvement. A final rating of about 17/20 reflects a solid, professional translation with some polish needed for perfect naturalness.\n\nScore out of 20 points: 17"
