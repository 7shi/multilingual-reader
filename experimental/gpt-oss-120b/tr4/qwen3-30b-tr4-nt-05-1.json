Consequently, all criteria receive a score of zero and the reasoning explains the inability to assess each aspect of translation quality.\n\nPlease provide the original French passage and its Spanish translation for a proper evaluation.\n\n(Note: Scores are set to 0 solely due to lack of material, not as a judgment of the translation quality.)\n\nIf you later supply the texts, a full re‑assessment can be carried out.\n\n---\n**Scoring Summary**: 0 / 100 total points (0 / 20 per criterion)."
