  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the complex ideas about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained clearly. Minor hiccups (e.g., “una IA totalmente nueva” instead of a more idiomatic “completamente nueva”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, and the flow is smooth. A few phrases feel slightly forced (“una chuleta” is colloquial and region‑specific, “ventana de contexto” is correct but less common than “ventana de contexto”). These do not break fluency but prevent a perfect rating.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “anclaje”, “memoria a corto plazo”. The choice of “afinamiento” for “fine‑tuning” is acceptable, though some readers might expect “ajuste fino”. Consistency is good, but a couple of terms could have been footnoted for a non‑expert audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast script. Cultural references are adapted well, but the use of “chuleta” (a slang term for cheat‑sheet) may not be universally understood across all Spanish‑speaking regions, slightly reducing accessibility.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original script. The translation remains concise without adding unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and is largely readable and natural for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Minor issues lie in occasional regional colloquialisms and slight term choices that could be refined for broader technical audiences. The translation would be well understood by the target listeners of a tech podcast.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 18, Fluency 17, Terminology 16, Contextual Adaptation 16, Information Completeness 19. The average yields an overall score of about 17/20, indicating a strong but not flawless rendering.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17"
