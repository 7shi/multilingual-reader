  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are kept simple. Minor issues such as the hyphen in \"pre‑entrenamiento\" (more common is \"preentrenamiento\") do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural, but a few expressions are slightly literal (e.g., \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\", \"ventana de contexto\" instead of the more common \"ventana de contexto\" is acceptable, but \"memoria a corto plazo de la IA\" could be phrased more idiomatically). Overall, a native speaker would understand it without effort.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ICL (aprendizaje en contexto)\", \"grounding\" rendered as \"anclaje\". English acronyms are retained with Spanish explanations, which is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenidos\", \"consultor brillante\"). Cultural references are neutral, and the speaker style feels suitable for a Spanish‑speaking tech‑podcast audience. A few literal turns remain, but they do not affect the intended meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present. No key points are omitted, and the logical flow of the dialogue is preserved. Redundancies are unchanged, which matches the source format.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality, conveying the technical content accurately while remaining accessible to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but the overall readability, terminology handling, and completeness are excellent.\n\nStrengths: faithful rendering of technical concepts, consistent terminology, clear explanations. Areas for improvement: smoother phrasing in a few sentences and a more idiomatic handling of certain compound terms.\n\nOverall the work is very professional and would work well for a podcast audience.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.4 → 18/20."
