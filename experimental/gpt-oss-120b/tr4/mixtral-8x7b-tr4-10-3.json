  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the original logical flow. However, there are repetitions (e.g., “su proceso de aprendizaje sigue un proceso”), occasional awkward phrasing and a stray English parenthetical that can momentarily confuse the reader.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several sentences sound unnatural for native speakers: the use of “ancraje” instead of “anclaje”, gender errors (“las conocimientos”), the expression “pañuelo con notas”, and the presence of English fragments inside parentheses. These reduce the naturalness of the text.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly correctly rendered (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL). The main flaw is the mistranslation of “grounding” as “ancraje”. Apart from that, terminology is consistent.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast style to Spanish fairly well, but the inclusion of English explanations, a stray hyperlink, and some culturally odd phrasing (e.g., “pañuelo con notas”) show a lack of full adaptation to the target audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the ideas from the French script are present; no major content is omitted. Minor issues are the English insertions that are not translated, which do not affect factual completeness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main concepts accurately and keeps the conversational tone, but it suffers from several linguistic slips: unnecessary English insertions, a few mistranslated technical words, gender agreement errors, and some clumsy phrasing. With careful editing to remove English fragments, correct the terminology (e.g., ‘anclaje’), and smooth out the awkward expressions, the text would reach a much higher level of fluency and readability.\nOverall score reflects an average performance across the criteria, landing at a solid but improvable 13 / 20.\n\n**Overall score (out of 20)**: 13"
