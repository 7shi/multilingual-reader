  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version flows logically and the concepts are explained clearly. Most sentences are easy to follow, and the dialogue format is preserved. Minor hiccups (e.g., occasional missing articles) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward expressions such as \"antiespuesta\" (a non‑existent word), \"el afinamiento\" (uncommon, usually \"fine‑tuning\" is left in English or \"ajuste fino\"), and the redundant parenthetical \"ICL (Aprendizaje en contexto)\". These reduce the overall smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"pre‑entraînement\" → \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\" → \"afinamiento\", \"transfer learning\" → \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"in‑context learning\" → \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and ICL kept. The term \"grounding\" is rendered as \"anclaje\", which is acceptable in Spanish AI literature. Consistency is maintained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts the discourse to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the educational tone is preserved. The only drawback is the unnatural \"antiespuesta\", which slightly harms cultural appropriateness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original script is present. No content is omitted, and the examples remain intact. The translation is faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is accurate and conveys the original message effectively. Readability and technical fidelity are strong, but a few lexical choices (especially \"antiespuesta\" and the handling of \"fine‑tuning\") make the text feel slightly less natural for native speakers. Minor edits could bring fluency up to a higher level, but the content is complete and understandable.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
