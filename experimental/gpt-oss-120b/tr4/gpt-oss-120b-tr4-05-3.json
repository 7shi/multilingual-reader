  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and the flow of ideas follows the original. Most sentences are easy to understand, and complex concepts are explained in a straightforward way. A few minor awkward phrasings (e.g., “el aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje”) slightly hinder smoothness, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds largely natural to a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and most idiomatic expressions are well‑chosen. There are a handful of literal renderings (“ventana de contexto”, “memoria a corto plazo”) that are correct but feel slightly stiff, and occasional over‑formal constructions, but overall the text reads smoothly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ICL (aprendizaje en contexto)”, “grounding” (manteniéndose en inglés) y “ventana de contexto”. The translator keeps consistency and provides parenthetical explanations where needed, which aids understanding.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts well to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using colloquial equivalents such as “chuleta” for “antisèche” and preserving the podcast tone. Minor regionalisms (e.g., “bachotaje”) are acceptable and the overall intent of the original is fully retained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present; no content is omitted or added unnecessarily. The translation maintains the structure and the length of the original, ensuring completeness.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality: it is faithful to the source, largely natural, and technically accurate. Minor stylistic quirks prevent a perfect score, but the text is fully understandable and well adapted for Spanish listeners of the podcast.\n\nStrengths: accurate terminology, good preservation of nuance, appropriate cultural touches.\nAreas for improvement: smooth out a few literal constructions and consider more idiomatic phrasing for certain technical explanations.\n\nFinal aggregate score: 92/100 (out of a possible 100)."
