  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure, but several awkward phrasings (e.g., “aprende el franción”, “no rep aprender”) and missing accent marks disrupt smooth comprehension. The core ideas are clear, yet a native reader would need to pause to parse some sentences.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are many non‑native constructions: mixing formal \"Usted\" with informal \"tú\", literal translations like \"copiar\" for \"bachoter\", and the typo \"franción\". Vocabulary is mostly appropriate, but the overall flow feels stilted.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well‑handled – preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje – and the explanations are kept. Minor inaccuracies (\"franción\") and occasional awkward paraphrases lower the perfect score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The podcast tone is preserved, but some expressions are not idiomatic for Spanish listeners (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenido en\", \"Usted ha entendido todo\"). Cultural adaptation is modest; the translation could be smoother for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present; no substantial content is omitted. Errors such as the typo \"franción\" and a few missing diacritics are the only losses, so the information remains essentially complete.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original message and retains most technical details, but it suffers from several lexical and grammatical slips that affect naturalness and readability. With careful proofreading and idiomatic rewrites, the quality could be raised to a native‑level podcast script.\nOverall, the work is solid in content preservation but needs polishing for fluency and stylistic accuracy.\nScore out of 20: 14/20 (average of the five criteria)."
