  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are clear and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. A few long sentences could be split for better readability, but overall a native Spanish reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are occasional awkward constructions (e.g., “Ustedes lo han entendido todo”, “El afinamiento” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”). Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, and the dialogue style is maintained.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding → anclaje, prompt left untranslated, etc. Consistency is maintained throughout. Only minor note: “afinamiento” could be rendered as “ajuste fino”, but the chosen term is still understandable for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the original intent and tone, adapting expressions to Spanish‑speaking listeners (e.g., “consultor brillante”). Cultural references are neutral and do not cause misunderstanding. Minor issues such as the shift to plural “Ustedes” are acceptable in this podcast context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant omissions or additions alter the meaning. The explanation of memory features and the distinction between ICL and fine‑tuning remain intact.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality, conveying the technical concepts accurately while keeping the conversational tone of the podcast. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but the text is clear, technically sound, and faithful to the source.\nOverall the translation merits a strong score, reflecting its readability, appropriate terminology, and faithful adaptation of the original content.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
