  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the technical ideas are explained clearly. Minor hiccups such as the stray English intro “Here is the translation:” and a few slightly clunky phrasings do not prevent comprehension, but they slightly lower the smoothness of reading.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part and uses appropriate everyday vocabulary. There are occasional awkward constructions (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje”, “De nada por escucharnos”) and the leftover English fragment, which a native speaker would likely edit. Overall, the fluency is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as « pre‑entrenamiento », « ajuste fino », « aprendizaje por transferencia », « ventana de contexto » and « aprendizaje en contexto (ICL) » are correctly rendered and used consistently throughout. The translator also kept the English acronyms (ICL) and provided Spanish equivalents where useful. No major terminology errors are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience, preserving the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural references are minimal, and the few idiomatic expressions (e.g., “es como contratar a un consultor brillante”) are appropriate. The only drawback is the inclusion of the meta‑commentary line, which breaks the narrative flow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All substantive information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No key points are omitted. The only extraneous material is the instructional phrase “Here is the translation:” that slipped into the dialogue, which does not remove any content but adds noise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately and understandably. Minor issues—an English placeholder line, a couple of slightly unnatural phrases, and a few small stylistic slips—prevent it from being perfect, but they do not detract significantly from the overall quality. With a brief proofreading pass to remove the stray English segment and smooth out a few expressions, the text would be near‑native quality.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 88/100."
