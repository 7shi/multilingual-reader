  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the flow of the dialogue mirrors the original French podcast script. Minor issues such as a duplicated speaker tag (\"Luc: Luc:\") do not impede comprehension, but they slightly affect polish.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The language sounds natural for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate, and idiomatic expressions (e.g., \"¡Exactamente!\", \"es como contratar a un consultor brillante\") are used correctly. A few small awkward spots (the duplicated tag, occasional over‑literal phrasing) prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\". The translator kept the original English acronyms where useful, preserving consistency throughout the text.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the podcast’s informal, conversational tone and adapts cultural references appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The use of exclamation marks and familiar phrasing fits the target culture. Only the minor duplication of a speaker label detracts slightly.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No content is omitted, and the meaning of each segment is retained. The only discrepancy is a typographic duplication, which does not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical concepts clearly, uses appropriate terminology, and maintains the original’s engaging podcast style. Minor typographic errors (duplicated speaker label) and a few slightly stiff phrasings keep it from being flawless, but they do not hinder understanding. The result is a fluent, accurate, and well‑adapted Spanish version of the French script.\n\nScore (out of 100): 92/100"
