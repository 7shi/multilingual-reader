    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear order. Sentences are generally short enough for easy comprehension, and complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained with simple examples. Minor redundancy in the definition of “anclaje” does not impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most of the script. Occasional awkwardness appears – e.g., the repeated phrase “el concepto de ‘anclaje’ (anclaje al contexto o grounding)”, the hyphenated “pre‑entrenamiento”, and the informal colloquialism “chivatazo”. These quirks are slight and do not break fluency, but they prevent a perfect native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, and “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”. The occasional retention of English words such as “grounding” is acceptable in a tech podcast context. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the intro (“Hola y bienvenidos”) and maintains the informal podcast tone suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the use of colloquial language (e.g., “chivatazo”) aligns with the conversational style, though it leans a bit informal for some listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is preserved. No sections are omitted or altered in meaning, and the examples remain intact. The translation is faithful and complete.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, keeps the podcast’s conversational tone, and is easy to follow. Minor stylistic issues (redundancies, a few informal words, and occasional hyphenation) keep it just short of flawless, but they do not detract significantly from the listener’s understanding.\n\nScore Summary: Readability 18/20, Fluency 17/20, Terminology 19/20, Contextual Adaptation 18/20, Information Completeness 20/20."
