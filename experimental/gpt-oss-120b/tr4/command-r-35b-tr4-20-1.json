  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are generally short and the logical flow mirrors the original French script. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained clearly. A few minor hiccups (e.g., “el pódcast” with an unnecessary accent) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part and uses appropriate everyday vocabulary. However, a couple of expressions sound slightly off for native speakers: “ancoraje” (the usual term is *anclaje*), “el afinado” (more common would be *afinamiento* or *ajuste fino*), and the accented “pódcast”. These affect the smoothness but are not severe.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms like *preentrenamiento*, *afinado*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, and *aprendizaje en contexto* are correctly rendered and consistent throughout. The only notable mis‑term is *ancoraje* instead of the standard *anclaje*, which could cause slight confusion for a specialist reader.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator respects the original intent and adapts idioms appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience (e.g., “estudiar para un examen” for “bachoter”). Cultural references are neutral and the tone of a podcast script is preserved. No cultural mismatches are observed.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No sentences are omitted or altered in meaning, and the examples (English‑to‑French transfer, consultant analogy, memory feature) are fully retained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is very good. It conveys the original content accurately, keeps the technical depth intact, and is largely readable and natural for Spanish speakers. Minor lexical choices (ancoraje, afinado, pódcast) prevent a perfect score but do not detract significantly from the overall quality.\n\nTotal score (out of 100): 92/100.\n\nRecommendations: replace *ancoraje* with *anclaje*, consider *afinamiento* or *ajuste fino* for \"affinage\", and drop the accent in *podcast* for a more idiomatic rendering.\n\nThe translation is ready for publication with only those small refinements.\n\nScore: 92/100"
