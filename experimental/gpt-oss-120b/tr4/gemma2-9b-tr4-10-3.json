  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences are clear, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can understand. Minor hiccups such as a few long sentences and occasional literal phrasing do not significantly hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are several awkward expressions that a native speaker would avoid (e.g., “Mira usted”, “el afianzamiento” instead of “ajuste fino”, “anclado” for grounding). These affect the smoothness of the dialogue, especially in a spoken‑podcast style.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, Aprendizaje en Contexto, ventana de contexto, etc. However, the translation is inconsistent with fine‑tuning: it uses both “ajuste fino” and the uncommon “afianzamiento”. The choice of “anclado” for grounding is acceptable but not the most common term, which may cause slight confusion.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast tone and intent, and cultural references are neutral enough for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Some formal phrasing (“Mira usted”) feels out of place in a casual conversation, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is retained. No ideas are omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as in the original. Redundancy is minimal, and the content stays concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and is largely understandable for Spanish listeners. The main areas for improvement are terminology consistency (especially for fine‑tuning) and smoothing out a few unnatural phrases to better match the informal podcast style. With those adjustments, the text would feel completely natural to native speakers.\nOverall score (out of 100): 82/100."
