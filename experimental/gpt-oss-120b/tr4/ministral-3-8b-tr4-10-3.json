    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured, and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are presented in a logical order. Minor hiccups such as leaving the French word *ancrage* untranslated do not seriously impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, but there are a few grammatical slips and awkward phrasings (e.g., \"¿Ya había escuchado ese término?\", \"para quien use estos herramientas\", mismatched gender and tense). These errors slightly break the flow for a native reader.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, ventana de contexto, etc., are correctly rendered. The only notable lapse is the retention of the French word *ancrage* instead of translating it to *anclaje* (or similar), and the occasional use of English ‘prompt’ without explanation.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The podcast tone is preserved, with a friendly greeting and informal dialogue suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural adaptation is appropriate, though a few minor gender/number mismatches slightly reduce the naturalness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No key points or examples are omitted, and the structure mirrors the source closely.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, conveying the original content accurately and maintaining the conversational podcast style. Minor grammatical errors, a couple of untranslated terms, and occasional awkward phrasing prevent a perfect score, but the work is nonetheless clear, informative, and faithful to the source.\n\nOverall score: 89/100 (average of the five criteria). The translation would benefit from a final proofreading pass to correct the few remaining linguistic slips and to translate the lingering French term, but it is ready for publication for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\nScore: 89/100 (sum of the five criterion scores)."
