  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and the dialogue flows logically. Most sentences are easy to understand, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can follow. Minor issues such as the use of \"el afinado\" instead of the more common \"el afinamiento\" and the occasional retention of French words (e.g., \"antisèche\", \"ancrage\") slightly hinder smooth comprehension for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are a few awkward constructions and lexical choices. Phrases like \"el afinado... ¿es ahí donde interviene el aprendizaje por transferencia?\" and the mixed‑language insertion \"el concepto de « ancrage » (grounding)\" feel stilted. The use of guillemets and the French term \"antisèche\" also break the native fluency. Apart from these points, the language is fluid and conversational.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is generally well handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", etc., are accurate. The main inconsistency is the noun for fine‑tuning (\"afinado\" vs the more precise \"afinamiento\") and the untranslated French term for grounding. Nevertheless, the core technical ideas are preserved and the vocabulary is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the original intent, tone and explanatory style, which is suitable for a podcast script. However, cultural adaptation is incomplete because several French loanwords remain (\"antisèche\", \"ancrage\"). A fully adapted version would replace these with Spanish equivalents (e.g., \"chuleta\", \"anclaje\"). This limits the degree to which the content feels tailored to Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No sections are omitted, and the logical order is preserved. The only minor drawback is the inclusion of untranslated French terms, which does not constitute loss of information but does affect readability.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast’s content accurately and maintains the conversational style, making the technical discussion accessible. It scores well on terminology and completeness, but fluency and readability suffer from occasional French remnants and slightly awkward phrasing. A revised version that fully localizes loanwords and smooths a few expressions would raise the overall quality to an excellent level.\n\nOverall score (average): 16.2/20."
