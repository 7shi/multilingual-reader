  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are clear and the flow mirrors the original dialogue. Minor typographical issues (e.g., duplicated \"Camille: Camille:\" and a stray exclamation \"¡Exacta!\") slightly disrupt reading but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, using appropriate Spanish syntax and idiomatic expressions. A few phrasing choices feel slightly awkward to a native speaker (e.g., \"¡Exacta!\" instead of \"¡Exacto!\", \"cacharrear\" for \"bachoter\" which is less common, and the literal retention of \"prompt\"), but overall the text flows smoothly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"transferencia de aprendizaje\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\" and \"anclaje\" are correctly rendered. The occasional retention of English words such as \"prompt\" is acceptable in a tech‑focused context. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogy of a consultant is correctly adapted. Minor glitches (duplicate label, occasional literalness) do not affect the overall message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted; the only issues are typographic repetitions that do not result in loss of meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical concepts clearly, uses appropriate terminology, and maintains the conversational style of the podcast. Small typographical and stylistic hiccups prevent a perfect score, but the text is fully understandable and faithful to the source.\n\nStrengths: accurate terminology, good readability, faithful preservation of intent. \nAreas for improvement: polish minor typographical errors, refine a few awkward phrasing choices, and consider more common Spanish equivalents for informal verbs like \"cacharrear\".\n\nThe translation would be readily usable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nScore out of 20 points: 17"
