  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences are clear and the concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can understand. A few minor issues such as the isolated line “El pre‑entrenamiento.” and occasional overly literal phrasing slightly affect flow, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part and uses appropriate colloquial register for a podcast. Some expressions feel literal (e.g., “el pre‑entrenamiento”, “una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”) and a couple of constructions are a bit clunky, but native speakers would still find it fluent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (In‑Context Learning)”, “anclaje (grounding)”. The terminology is consistent throughout and matches the usual Spanish jargon used in AI discussions. Only minor stylistic choices could be improved (e.g., writing “preentrenamiento” without hyphen).",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone and educational purpose. Cultural references are neutral, and the podcast‑like conversational style is kept. Minor literal renderings (e.g., “consultor brillante”) are still appropriate in Spanish. Overall, the adaptation to the target audience is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is retained. No significant content is omitted or added unnecessarily. The translation conveys the same examples, analogies and explanations, keeping the episode’s structure intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational podcast tone, and is mostly fluent and readable. Minor issues stem from literal renderings and occasional awkward phrasing, but they do not substantially detract from the listener’s understanding. The handling of technical terminology is solid and consistent, and the adaptation respects the cultural context of a Spanish‑speaking audience. With a few stylistic tweaks, the text would be near‑perfect.\n\n**Total score:** 88/100 (average 17.6/20 per criterion)."
