  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained clearly. Minor hiccups (e.g., the parenthetical note about “subir al caballo”, punctuation issues) slightly disrupt flow but do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally in most places, but there are several awkward constructions: “subir al caballo (se entiende “bicicleta”…)”, the mixed use of “ajuste fino” and “afinamiento”, and odd punctuation in “¿qué es?”. These make the translation feel a bit stilted for native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is largely preserved and appropriate – preentrenamiento, ajuste fino/fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, anclaje, etc. The only drawback is the slight inconsistency between “ajuste fino” and later “afinamiento”, which could confuse readers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original podcast are well conveyed. Cultural references are neutral and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The change of the show name to “Tech Luz” and the strange “subir al caballo” note are minor mismatches that slightly affect adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs permanent knowledge distinction, and the explanation of “memory” features. No substantive information is omitted, though a parenthetical explanatory note is added that was not in the source.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content and conversational style of the original podcast. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency and cultural adaptation show some room for improvement, especially regarding a few awkward phrasings and inconsistent term usage. The translation is complete and faithful, making it useful for Spanish‑speaking listeners, but polishing the language would raise its naturalness to native‑speaker level.\n\nScore breakdown: 16 (readability) + 14 (fluency) + 17 (terminology) + 15 (contextual adaptation) + 18 (information completeness) = **80 / 100**."
