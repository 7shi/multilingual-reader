  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the original ideas clearly and the flow of the conversation is easy to follow. Most sentences are understandable, though a few long sentences could be split for better legibility. Overall, a French‑speaking audience would find the content comprehensible without major effort.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are occasional awkward constructions and minor grammatical slips (e.g., \"se inserta automáticamente estos fragmentos\" should be \"se insertan\"; the use of \"afinamiento\" for fine‑tuning is understandable but not the most common term in Spanish). These issues slightly break the native‑speaker flow.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"anclaje\" are appropriate and consistent. The only slight deviation is the occasional use of less‑common equivalents, but they do not hinder understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral, and the examples (consultant, exam cramming) work equally well for Spanish‑speaking listeners. No meaning is lost or distorted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant details are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue. Minor redundancies are inherited from the source and do not affect completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It successfully transmits the technical content and conversational tone of the original podcast. Minor fluency issues and a few less‑common lexical choices keep it just short of perfect, but they do not impede comprehension. The terminology is appropriate, and the adaptation respects the target audience's expectations.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 17, Fluency 15, Terminology 18, Contextual Adaptation 18, Information Completeness 19. The average yields an overall score of 17 out of 20.\n\nPotential improvements: use more common Spanish terms for fine‑tuning (\"ajuste fino\"), correct the verb agreement in \"se insertan\", and consider breaking long sentences for smoother reading.\n\nOverall score: 17/20."
