  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the sentences are easy to follow. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained clearly with analogies that work well in Spanish. The occasional long sentence is still understandable, and the informal podcast style is preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. Minor awkwardness appears in phrases like “El modelo mismo no aprende…” (could be “El propio modelo…”) and “funciones de memorización” (more common would be “funciones de memoria”), but these do not break fluency.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento for fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje for grounding, etc. Consistency is maintained throughout. Only a tiny note: \"afinamiento\" is less common than \"ajuste fino\", but it is still understandable.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the informal podcast tone, uses colloquial Spanish such as “chuleta”, and respects cultural norms (e.g., keeping the French‑style quotes « »). The intent and humor of the original are preserved, making it suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original script is retained. No sentences or details are omitted, and the explanations are as complete as in the source. Redundancy is not introduced.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is excellent. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the lively podcast voice, and is largely natural and readable. A few minor stylistic tweaks could make it even smoother, but they do not detract from the high quality.\nScore out of 100: 94/100.\nThe translation demonstrates strong command of both languages and good handling of specialized terminology while keeping the original’s engaging tone.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 18, Fluency 18, Terminology 19, Contextual Adaptation 19, Information Completeness 20, total 94/100."
