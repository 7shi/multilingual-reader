  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear order. Even the more abstract concepts (transfer learning, in‑context learning) are explained with concrete analogies that are easy to follow. Sentence length is moderate; occasional long sentences are still comprehensible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary (e.g., “consultor brillante”, “ventana de contexto”). Minor awkwardness appears in a few places (“una IA completamente nueva”, “una velocidad increíble”) but these do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: «pré‑entraînement» → “pre‑entrenamiento”, «fine‑tuning» → “ajuste fino”, «transfer learning» → “aprendizaje por transferencia”, ICL → “ICL (In‑Context Learning)”. When a term could be unfamiliar, a brief explanation is provided, preserving the technical accuracy.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references and idioms to Spanish‑speaking audiences (e.g., “bachotaje” for cramming, “una analogía perfecta”). The tone remains conversational and matches the podcast format. No French‑specific expressions were left untranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is retained. No ideas are omitted, and the supplementary explanations (e.g., the “trick” of memory features) are preserved. Redundancy is not introduced; the text stays concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the original content accurately, uses appropriate technical language, and sounds natural to Spanish listeners. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but they do not affect comprehension. The work successfully balances fidelity to the source with readability for the target audience.\n\nStrengths: clear exposition of complex AI concepts, consistent terminology, good cultural adaptation.\nAreas for improvement: smooth out a couple of slightly literal constructions to make them feel even more idiomatic.\n\nOverall rating: 19/20.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 18, Fluency 18, Terminology 19, Contextual Adaptation 18, Information Completeness 20.\n\nFinal score (average rounded): 19/20."
