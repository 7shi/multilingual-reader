  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the flow of ideas follows the original script. However, there are several moments that disrupt smooth comprehension: the mixed‑language greeting “Bonjour y bienvenido”, the inconsistent use of formal/informal pronouns (\"usted\" vs \"tú\"/\"vuestras\"), and duplicated speaker labels (\"Luc: Luc:\"). These issues require the reader to pause and re‑interpret, lowering the score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences are natural, but a number of constructions sound awkward or overly literal: \"Podéis tomar un modelo\" (regional and redundant), \"el concepto de \"anclaje\" (grounding)\" mixes languages, and the occasional redundant phrasing (\"Luc: Luc:\") breaks the flow. The mix of formal and informal registers also feels inconsistent. These flaws prevent the translation from sounding completely native.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\" and \"grounding\" are either kept in their accepted Spanish forms or left in the original abbreviation with appropriate explanation. Only minor points are deducted for not italicizing or highlighting foreign terms, which is a stylistic rather than a substantive issue.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and keeps the podcast‑like tone. Cultural adaptation is adequate, but the occasional mix of formal \"usted\" with informal \"tú\"/\"vuestras\" and the lingering French greeting reduce the natural fit for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Overall the message is conveyed correctly, just not fully optimized for the target culture.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No concepts are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue. The only minor issues are typographic (duplicate speaker tags) that do not affect the conveyed content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content and the conversational style of the podcast. It excels in preserving terminology and completeness, but readability and fluency suffer from inconsistent register, occasional literal translations, and small formatting errors. With a few edits to harmonize pronouns, remove duplicated labels, and smooth out the mixed‑language openings, the text would reach a near‑native level.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
