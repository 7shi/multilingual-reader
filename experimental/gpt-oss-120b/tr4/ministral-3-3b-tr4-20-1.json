  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but several typographical errors and the presence of French fragments (e.g., \"Et soyoy Luc\", \"C’est là que interviene\", \"Je veo\") disrupt the flow. Some sentences are overly long or awkwardly punctuated, which can force the reader to re‑read. The core ideas are still clear, but the mixed language lowers ease of comprehension.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many non‑native constructions: duplicated speaker tags (\"Luc: Luc:\"), literal translations that sound odd in Spanish, and inconsistent use of pronouns (\"Ustedes han entendido todo\"). The mix of French words inside Spanish sentences further harms naturalness. While most vocabulary is appropriate, the overall texture feels stilted.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved correctly (\"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"grounding\"). The translator adds helpful parenthetical English equivalents where needed. Some minor inconsistencies appear (e.g., \"anclaje\" for grounding, which is acceptable but less common), but overall the terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation aims at a Spanish‑speaking audience but retains French interjections and syntax, which can feel out of place culturally. The humor and informal podcast tone are mostly kept, yet the occasional French phrases reduce the sense that the text has been fully adapted to the target culture.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the notion of temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No significant information is lost, and the structure mirrors the source. Minor redundancies (duplicate speaker labels) do not affect content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the essential content and technical details, but it suffers from language mixing, typographical errors, and occasional awkward phrasing that detract from readability and naturalness. A thorough proofread to eliminate French remnants and improve sentence flow would raise the quality substantially.\n\n**Total score:** 69/100 (out of 100 possible points)."
