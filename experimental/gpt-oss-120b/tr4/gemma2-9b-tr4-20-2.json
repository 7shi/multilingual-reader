  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the logical flow of the original dialogue. Most sentences are clear, and complex concepts (pre‑training, transfer learning, in‑context learning) are explained in simple terms. However, occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., “Lo has comprendo todo”) and the uncommon use of “afianzamiento” for fine‑tuning slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural to native speakers: “Lo has comprendo todo”, “El afianzamiento…”, and the inconsistent abbreviation “AIL” instead of the usual “ICL”. Some sentences are literal translations that feel stilted, though the overall discourse remains coherent.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly correctly rendered (preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto). The main problem is the translation of “fine‑tuning” as “afianzamiento”, which is not standard in the AI community, and the change of the abbreviation from ICL to AIL, which may confuse readers.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content well to a Spanish‑speaking audience, preserving the podcast‑style tone and using appropriate cultural references. Minor issues (non‑standard terms, occasional literalness) prevent a perfect adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original script is present; no major ideas are omitted. The only loss is the consistent labeling of the abbreviation, which is a minor inconsistency rather than a loss of content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast’s educational narrative accurately and maintains most of its clarity. Strengths lie in preserving the logical structure and covering all key points. Weaknesses are mainly lexical: the use of uncommon terms for fine‑tuning, a few grammatical slips, and the inconsistent abbreviation for in‑context learning. With a few edits to align terminology with standard Spanish AI vocabularies and to smooth out the few awkward sentences, the translation would reach a high‑quality level.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
