  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is generally easy to follow and the logical flow mirrors the original dialogue. However, there are noticeable repetitions of speaker labels (e.g., “Camille: Camille:”, “Luc: Luc:”) and occasional awkward phrasing such as “Vea más bien” instead of a more natural “Mira mejor”. These glitches slightly impede smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish reads mostly naturally, but the duplicated speaker tags and a few literal translations give it a stilted feel. Phrases like “Es una analogía perfecta !” and the inconsistent use of punctuation make it sound less idiomatic. Overall it is understandable but not fully fluent.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is handled well: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)*, and *grounding* rendered as *anclaje*. The terms are consistent throughout and appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, adapting metaphors (consultor brillante, aprender a andar en bicicleta) appropriately for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor issues (e.g., “Vea más bien”) do not significantly alter meaning, so the cultural adaptation is largely successful.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is omitted, and the explanatory details are retained. The only drawback is the redundant speaker labels, which are superficial rather than content‑loss.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and keeps the original conversational style, but it suffers from mechanical errors like duplicated speaker tags and occasional literal phrasing that affect readability and fluency. Technical terminology is spot‑on, and the core information is fully retained. With a light edit to clean up repetitions and smooth out a few awkward sentences, the text would reach a native‑level quality.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 16/20."
