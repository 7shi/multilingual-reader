  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the explanations of complex AI concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are clear and easy to follow. Sentence length is comparable to the original and there are no major ambiguities. Minor punctuation quirks do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural to a native Spanish speaker. Most vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary. A few expressions feel slightly forced or redundant (e.g., “anclaje (anclaje al contexto o grounding)”, “el afinado” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”), but they do not break fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “grounding”. The only slight deviation is the use of “afinamiento” which, while understandable, is less standard than “ajuste fino”. Overall consistency is maintained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural references are neutral and the content is accessible to Spanish‑speaking audiences. Small stylistic issues (hyphenation in “pre‑entrenamiento”, redundant parenthesis) are present but do not affect the overall adaptation.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas, examples, and analogies from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No relevant information is omitted, and no extraneous material is added. The translation remains concise while keeping the full meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is highly faithful and conveys the technical content clearly. It reads well for a Spanish‑speaking audience, with only minor lexical oddities and occasional redundancy. The technical terminology is largely accurate, and no substantive information is lost. Minor refinements (e.g., using “ajuste fino” instead of “afinamiento”, simplifying the grounding parenthesis) would bring it to near‑perfect quality.\nOverall score: 18/20.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 18, Fluency 17, Terminology 18, Contextual Adaptation 18, Information Completeness 20. The average yields an overall rating of 18 out of 20."
