  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas are easy to follow. Most sentences are well‑structured and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are retained. Minor issues such as the slightly formal \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\" and a few punctuation quirks do not hinder comprehension, but they slightly lower the smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are occasional literal renderings that feel a bit forced: \"Aprendizaje en Contexto Interno\" for ICL, the use of \"una antisèche\" rendered as \"una guía rápida\" (acceptable but not the most idiomatic) and some redundant exclamation marks. Overall, a native speaker would understand it easily, yet the flow is not perfectly polished.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly transferred: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, anclaje (grounding). The abbreviation ICL is explained, although the Spanish expansion \"Aprendizaje en Contexto Interno\" is not the standard translation and could confuse readers. Nonetheless, the terminology is consistent and appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural adaptation is adequate – the style remains that of a podcast dialogue and uses natural interjections like \"¡Exacto!\". The only notable mismatch is the non‑standard translation of ICL, which could be clarified, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No relevant detail is omitted, and the translation does not introduce unnecessary redundancy. The content remains faithful to the original script.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the original French podcast script accurately and understandably. It maintains the educational flow and covers all technical points. Minor lexical choices (especially the expansion of ICL) and a few slightly stiff phrasings prevent it from being perfectly natural, but these do not detract from overall comprehension. The translation is solid and only needs small refinements for native‑speaker polish.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 84/100."
