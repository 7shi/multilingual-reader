  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are understandable for a non‑expert audience. A few long sentences could be broken up, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most of the dialogue, but there are occasional awkward choices: “Aprendizaje In‑Context” is not a common Spanish abbreviation (ICL would be kept), “Tech Iluminado” feels like a loose adaptation of the podcast title, and some phrasing (“el modelo en sí no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus discusiones”) is a bit clunky. Nevertheless, a native speaker would grasp the meaning without difficulty.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely well‑handled: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, anclaje (grounding) are correctly translated. The main inconsistency is the use of “AIC (Aprendizaje In‑Context)” instead of the standard “ICL (aprendizaje en contexto)”, which may confuse readers familiar with the English acronyms.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the informal podcast tone and adapts cultural references appropriately. The shift from «Tech Éclair» to «Tech Iluminado» keeps the bright‑light metaphor, and the dialogue feels natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original script is retained. No key point is omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as in the French version. Minor stylistic changes do not affect the content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the original content accurately. Readability and completeness are strong, and the technical ideas are well communicated. The main areas for improvement are consistency in technical abbreviations and smoothing a few unnatural phrasing choices to reach a higher level of fluency for native speakers.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 16, Fluency 15, Terminology 17, Contextual Adaptation 18, Information Completeness 19. The average yields an overall score of 17/20, indicating a high‑quality translation with minor refinements needed.\n\n**Overall score:** 17/20"
