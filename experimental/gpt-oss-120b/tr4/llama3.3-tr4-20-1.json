  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas without confusing constructions. Minor hiccups (e.g., occasional overly literal phrasing) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural to a native speaker. A few expressions are slightly stilted or overly formal (e.g., \"Ustedes lo han entendido todo\" instead of \"Lo han entendido todo\"), and there is a missing opening question mark in the final rhetorical question, but overall the flow is smooth.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled very well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje\" are all appropriate and consistently used. English acronyms are kept with their Spanish explanations, which is the standard practice.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects Spanish‑speaking cultural and linguistic conventions. Most idioms are adapted correctly, and the tone fits a podcast dialogue. The only minor issue is the use of \"Ustedes\" which feels a bit formal for the host‑to‑host exchange, but it does not alter the intended meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and no extraneous content is added. The translation remains faithful to the source while staying concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It faithfully conveys the technical content, uses appropriate terminology, and is largely readable and natural. Minor stylistic tweaks (especially around pronoun usage and punctuation) would bring it even closer to native‑speaker fluency, but the text is fully functional for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\n**Overall Score (out of 20): 18**\n\n**Breakdown:** Readability 17, Fluency 16, Terminology 19, Contextual Adaptation 18, Information Completeness 20."
