  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original flow, but there are several hiccups that affect smooth reading: mixing French and Spanish in the opening line, inconsistent use of pronouns (tú vs vosotros), and occasional missing accents or punctuation. These issues require the reader to pause, but the core ideas remain clear.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnaturally phrased segments (e.g., \"Bonjour y bienvenido\", \"Podéis tomar\" when the rest of the dialogue uses singular forms, \"memorizar de memoria\"). Grammar mistakes such as missing accent on \"¿Porque\" and duplicated speaker label (\"Luc: Luc:\") further break the natural flow. A native speaker would find the text somewhat awkward.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is handled well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\", \"grounding\" are correctly rendered and kept consistent. Minor stylistic choices (hyphenation, capitalization) do not impair comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly preserves the original intent, but cultural and register mismatches appear: mixing languages in the greeting, switching between \"tú\" and \"vosotros\", and occasional literal translations that sound odd in Spanish. Nonetheless, the overall message is conveyed.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the explanations remain intact, even if some phrasing is redundant.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in delivering the full technical content and retains the structure of the original podcast script. Strengths lie in accurate terminology and completeness. However, readability and fluency suffer from mixed language usage, inconsistent pronoun forms, and a few grammatical slips that make the text feel less natural to a native Spanish audience. A revision focusing on consistent register, correcting small errors, and polishing awkward phrases would raise the overall quality considerably.\n\nOverall score: 78/100."
