  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is overall clear and the concepts are explained in a way that Spanish‑speaking listeners can follow. Minor issues such as the mixed greeting \"Bonjour y bienvenido\" and occasional punctuation quirks slightly hinder smooth reading, but they do not obstruct comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text generally sounds natural, but a few expressions feel awkward or literal (e.g., \"Bonjour y bienvenido\", \"una libreta de consulta\"). The use of quotes and parentheses is a bit heavy, yet the sentences flow well for a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning (ajuste fino)\", \"transfer learning\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"grounding\", \"memoria\". The English acronyms are retained, which is appropriate for the target audience. Consistency is good throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast’s informal, conversational tone and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., \"consultor brillante\"). The only noticeable lapse is the initial French‑Spanish mix, which slightly breaks immersion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No content has been omitted, and no unnecessary redundancy was introduced.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does an excellent job conveying the original material, preserving both the technical depth and the conversational style of the podcast. Minor linguistic slips—especially the French‑Spanish hybrid greeting—prevent it from being flawless, but they do not detract significantly from the overall quality. The handling of technical terminology is solid, and the content is complete and well‑adapted for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\nOverall, the translation is strong, with room for polishing a few phrasing choices to reach native‑level fluency throughout.\n\nScore out of 20 (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
