  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the original flow, but there are noticeable typographical repetitions (e.g., \"Camille: Camille:\" and \"Luc: Luc:\"), and a few awkward phrases such as \"La diferencia entre chismear para un examen...\" which can confuse readers. The sentence structures are mostly logical, but the duplicated labels and occasional literal translations slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several non‑native constructions: duplicated speaker tags, the literal borrowing of the French word \"bachotage\" without an equivalent Spanish term, and occasional grammatical slips (e.g., \"Es lógico\" preceded by a duplicated name). While most vocabulary is appropriate, these issues make the text feel stilted rather than natural for a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely correct – \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje\". The only notable lapse is the retention of \"bachotage\" instead of a Spanish equivalent like \"estudio intensivo\". Consistency across the script is good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are neutral, and the explanation of concepts remains faithful. Minor issues (the word \"chismear\" and the French loanword) slightly reduce cultural appropriateness, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the examples (consultant analogy, memory feature) are retained. Redundancies are limited to the duplicated speaker labels, which are formatting errors rather than loss of information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core content accurately and keeps the instructional tone of the podcast. However, typographical repetitions, a few literal translations, and the use of a French‑specific term ('bachotage') detract from readability and naturalness. With minor editing to remove duplicate labels, replace awkward expressions, and adapt loanwords, the Spanish version would be fluent and fully polished.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
