  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the sentences are short enough to be easily followed. Complex ideas such as pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia and aprendizaje en contexto are explained with clear analogies, making the content accessible to non‑expert listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", \"memoria a corto plazo\"). Minor literal renderings like \"ventana de contexto\" and the occasional repetition of \"exactamente\" are a little stiff but do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje\" are correctly translated and kept uniform. The choice of \"anclaje\" for \"grounding\" is acceptable in a Spanish‑speaking technical audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue, adapting cultural references subtly (e.g., using \"consultor\" instead of \"consultante\"). The explanation of memory features is adapted well for Spanish‑speaking users, though the phrase \"una forma inteligente de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\" could be slightly smoother.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present: the stages of training, the difference between fine‑tuning and in‑context learning, the analogy of temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the description of the “Memoria” feature. No significant omissions or added irrelevant material.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains clear and engaging for a general audience, and uses appropriate Spanish terminology. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but they do not affect the comprehension or the fidelity to the source.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 18, Fluency 17, Terminology 18, Contextual Adaptation 17, Information Completeness 19. The average yields an overall rating of 18/20.\n\nThe translation succeeds in preserving the podcast’s conversational style while making the technical concepts accessible to Spanish listeners.\n\nOverall score (average): 18"
