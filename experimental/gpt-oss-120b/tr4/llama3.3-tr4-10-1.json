  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the ideas without ambiguity, and the logical flow mirrors the original dialogue. Minor awkwardness appears in a few constructions (e.g., “se ha vuelto simplemente vacío”), but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most of the passage, but there are occasional formal or stilted expressions that feel out of place in a casual podcast (e.g., “Usted lo ha entendido todo.”, “se ha vuelto simplemente vacío”). These small issues prevent it from being completely fluent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, ventana de contexto, anclaje (grounding). The English terms are kept in parentheses for clarity, and the terminology is used consistently throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original’s conversational tone and intent. However, the shift to a formal “usted” pronoun introduces a slightly more formal register than the original French, which is more neutral/informal. Apart from that, cultural references are appropriate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and nuances from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted, and the supplementary explanations (e.g., about the memory feature) are retained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and maintains overall readability. Minor issues with register and occasional awkward phrasing keep it just short of a perfect score. It would benefit from smoothing formal pronouns and polishing a few sentences for a more natural podcast style, but the core message and terminology are solidly transferred.\nOverall score (average of criteria, scaled to 20): 17.5 ≈ 17/20."
