  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the complex AI concepts are explained clearly. Minor issues such as the hyphenated “pre‑entrenamiento” (normally written *preentrenamiento*) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker. A few constructions feel slightly stiff – e.g., “funciones de memorización” instead of the more common “función de memoria”, and “partes de un contexto vacío” – but overall the flow is smooth and idiomatic.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately rendered and consistently used: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *anclaje*. The occasional stylistic variation does not affect precision.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The podcast tone is preserved, with lively interjections like “¡Exactamente!”. Cultural references are appropriate for Spanish‑speaking audiences and the analogy of a “consultor brillante” works well.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present. No key points are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the original content accurately, maintains the conversational podcast style, and uses appropriate technical language. Minor lexical tweaks could improve fluency, but they do not detract from the message. The translation would be readily understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 18, Fluency 17, Terminology 19, Contextual Adaptation 18, Information Completeness 20 – total 92/100.\n\nThe translation is strong and only needs a few stylistic refinements to reach near‑perfect fluency."
