    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear order. Most sentences are easy to follow, and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are understandable for a non‑specialist audience. Minor hiccups such as the uncommon word “ancoraje” slightly affect smoothness, but overall comprehension is very good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a podcast format, using colloquial expressions like “chuleta” and “consultor brillante”. A few phrases are a little awkward (“el afinado”, “el concepto de ‘ancoraje’”) and the accent on “pódcast” is unusual, but these do not break the naturalness. The overall register matches the original conversational tone.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled appropriately: “preentrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning” (kept as “afinado”), “transfer learning” is explained through examples, “In‑Context Learning” is rendered as “aprendizaje en contexto”, and “grounding” is introduced as “ancoraje” (a slight deviation from the more common “anclaje”). Consistency is maintained throughout the text.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references well (e.g., “chuleta”, “consultor brillante”) and preserves the original intent and humor. The only drawback is the occasional literal rendering of French‑style expressions that feel a bit forced in Spanish, but the overall adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is retained. No ideas are omitted or added unnecessarily. The content remains concise while preserving the full meaning of each segment.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational podcast tone, and is largely easy to read for Spanish speakers. Minor lexical choices (e.g., “ancoraje” instead of the more idiomatic “anclaje”) and occasional slightly stiff phrasing keep the score just shy of perfect, but the overall result is clear, fluent, and faithful to the source.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 18/20, Fluency 17/20, Terminology 19/20, Contextual Adaptation 16/20, Information Completeness 20/20.
