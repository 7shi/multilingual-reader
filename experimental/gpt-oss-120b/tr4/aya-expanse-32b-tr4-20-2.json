  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured, and complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. Minor punctuation quirks do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural for a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. A few passages are slightly literal (e.g., \"memoria a corto plazo de la IA\" instead of a more idiomatic \"memoria de corto plazo\"), but overall the flow is smooth and there are no glaring grammatical errors.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\". Where needed, the translator kept the English acronym in parentheses, which helps readers familiar with the original literature. No important term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and tone of a podcast script. Cultural references are neutral, so no adaptation is required, and the Spanish version maintains the informal yet informative style suitable for a broad audience. A couple of phrases could be slightly more idiomatic, but the overall message is preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and no redundant material is added. The translator also kept the parenthetical explanations that aid understanding, ensuring completeness.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation from French to Spanish is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains readable and engaging, and uses appropriate terminology throughout. Minor literal renderings prevent a perfect native‑speaker feel, but they do not affect comprehension. Overall, the work is very close to a native‑level podcast script.\n\nStrengths: precise terminology, faithful rendering of concepts, clear structure.\nAreas for improvement: smooth out a few literal phrases for a more idiomatic flow.\n\nOverall rating: 95/100 (average 19/20)."
