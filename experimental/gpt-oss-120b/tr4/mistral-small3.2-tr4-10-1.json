  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained clearly. A few long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but overall a Spanish‑speaking listener can understand everything without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic (e.g., \"¡Exactamente!\", \"consultor brillante\"). Minor hiccups appear, such as the use of \"Vean:\" which feels slightly forced in spoken Spanish, and occasional mixing of formal and informal registers, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje\" are all rendered consistently. The choice of \"afinamiento\" over the more common \"ajuste fino\" is acceptable within the podcast context.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast tone, the interplay between Camille and Luc, and the explanatory style. Cultural references are neutral, and the Spanish version adapts expressions (e.g., \"¡Exactamente!\", \"¡Una analogía perfecta!\") to sound natural for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines and informational content from the French source are present. No key idea is omitted, and no redundant material is added. The translation is faithful to the original message.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational flow of the podcast, and is largely fluent and readable. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve naturalness, but the work is solid and would be well‑understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners interested in AI concepts.\n\nStrengths: faithful terminology, clear explanations, good adaptation of tone. Areas for improvement: smoother phrasing in a couple of spots (e.g., \"Vean:\"), and slight consistency in register.\n\nThe translation merits an overall score of 18/20, reflecting its strong performance with only small room for refinement."
