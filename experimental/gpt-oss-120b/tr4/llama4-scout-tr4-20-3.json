  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the dialogue format is preserved, making it easy to follow. Most sentences convey the original ideas without confusing constructions. Minor issues such as the stray English phrase “Here is the translation:” and a few punctuation quirks slightly interrupt the flow, but overall a native reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly naturally, but there are several literal renderings and editorial leftovers that feel awkward (e.g., “La IA no se ajusta constantemente a través de tus conversaciones”, “Es un truco, ¿verdad?”, and the inclusion of English meta‑comments). Vocabulary choices are appropriate, yet the occasional clunky phrasing reduces the smoothness expected in fluent speech.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and “grounding” are correctly translated and consistently used. The translator also kept the English abbreviations where necessary, which helps maintain precision.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts the examples (consultant, student, etc.) appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, residual English markers and some overly literal phrases detract from a fully culturally adapted version.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the substantive information from the French script is present; no major ideas are omitted. The only drawback is the inclusion of meta‑text (e.g., “Here is the translation:”) which adds noise but does not cause loss of content.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully conveys the technical discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning. Terminology is accurate and the core message is intact. Fluency and readability are good overall, but the presence of leftover editorial notes and occasional literal phrasing prevent it from being fully polished. With a final edit to remove English interjections and smooth out a few awkward sentences, the text would reach a higher level of naturalness.\n\nOverall score: 80/100."
