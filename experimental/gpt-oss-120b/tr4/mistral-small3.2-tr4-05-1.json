  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can understand. A few long sentences could be split, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, but there are occasional literal‑translation traces (e.g., \"el preentrenamiento\", \"el afinamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\") that sound slightly technical or stilted to native speakers. Minor punctuation issues (a comma before \"es\") also appear. Overall the language flows well.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, anclaje, etc. The only minor point is that \"afinamiento\" is less common than the usual \"ajuste fino\" in Spanish technical literature, but the meaning is clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral, and the examples (consultant, student, etc.) are adapted without loss of meaning. A few phrases remain very literal, yet they do not affect the overall message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is retained. No sections are omitted, and no extraneous content is added. The nuance between temporary (ICL) and permanent (fine‑tuning) knowledge is fully preserved.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is very good. It conveys the technical content accurately and maintains the conversational style of the podcast. Minor lexical choices and occasional literal phrasing prevent it from being completely native‑like, but these do not impede understanding. The work could be improved by using more idiomatic Spanish technical terms (e.g., \"ajuste fino\") and by smoothing a few long sentences, yet the translation succeeds in delivering a clear, fluent, and faithful rendering of the original dialogue.\nScore (out of 100): 89/100."
