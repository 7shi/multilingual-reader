  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the logical flow of the original. Most sentences are clear, but there are occasional awkward mixes (e.g., “Bonjour y bienvenido”) and gender/agreement slips that slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in many places, yet several expressions are unidiomatic or retain French words (“bachotage”, “ventana de contexto”). Inconsistent use of “tus” vs. “vuestras” and phrases like “una forma astucia” reduce the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is well‑handled: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, etc., are correctly rendered. The only minor issue is the retention of the French term “bachotage” instead of a Spanish equivalent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly preserves the original intent and tone, but the occasional French‑Spanish hybrid and inconsistent regional pronouns make it feel less tailored to a single Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural adaptation is adequate otherwise.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas, examples, and analogies from the French script are present. No substantive information is lost, and the explanations remain intact.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original content accurately and keeps the technical depth, but it suffers from occasional language mixing and non‑idiomatic phrasing that affect fluency and readability. Terminology is strong, and no important information is omitted. With a few stylistic adjustments—especially removing French remnants and smoothing regional variations—the text would read as a polished native Spanish podcast script.\nOverall score (average): 16.4/20 (≈ 82/100)."
