  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly understandable, but large portions of the dialogue are missing (several lines of Luc’s explanations are omitted). These gaps break the flow and force the reader to guess the missing content, greatly reducing comprehensibility.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Where the translation is present, the sentences are generally grammatical and sound natural. Some wording is slightly awkward (e.g., “afinado” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”, occasional punctuation issues), but overall the language reads smoothly.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved (preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje). However, the choice of “afinado” for fine‑tuning is not the standard Spanish term, and a few English acronyms are left unexplained, which could confuse non‑expert readers.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone, but the missing segments hinder the conveyance of the full message. Cultural adaptation is adequate; the podcast‑style dialogue is maintained.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A significant amount of information from the original script is omitted: many of Luc’s explanatory sentences, analogies, and the concluding remarks are absent. This results in a severely incomplete rendering of the source.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the spirit of the original podcast and is mostly fluent where it exists, but it is far from complete. Large gaps in the dialogue, occasional terminology mismatches, and missing explanatory content make it unsuitable for readers who need the full technical explanation. Substantial revisions are required to fill in the omitted parts and to polish terminology for a native‑speaker audience.\nOverall rating (average of criteria): 9/20.\nScore: 9/20"
