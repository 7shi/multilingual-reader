    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the logical flow of the original dialogue. Most sentences are clear, but occasional English fragments (e.g., “then, it transfers its vast general knowledge…”) and mixed‑language parenthetical notes interrupt the reading experience. The inconsistent naming of the podcast (Tech Claridad vs. Tech Éclair) also creates mild confusion.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds fairly natural in many places, but there are several awkward expressions and lexical slips: “approach” is left in English, “ancraje” is not the usual term (the correct word is “anclaje”), and occasional literal translations produce stilted phrasing. The presence of English side‑comments further harms fluency.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto” and “aprendizaje en contexto” is correctly rendered. However, the mistranslation of “grounding” as “ancraje” and the retention of English words like “approach” and “ICL” without explanation reduce consistency. Overall the handling is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the content for a Spanish‑speaking audience, using appropriate examples and explanations. Nonetheless, changing the podcast name to “Tech Claridad” (instead of keeping the original proper name) and adding explanatory parentheticals that were not in the source alter the original intent. The cultural adaptation is adequate but not perfectly faithful.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the “memory” feature. Minor omissions occur where English sentences were left untranslated, but no essential concept is lost. Redundancy is low.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core concepts of the podcast episode and is largely comprehensible. However, it suffers from inconsistency (podcast name, mixed language), several lexical errors (e.g., \"ancraje\", retained English words), and unnecessary explanatory side‑notes that were not in the original. With careful proofreading to remove English fragments, correct terminology, and keep proper names unchanged, the quality would improve significantly."
