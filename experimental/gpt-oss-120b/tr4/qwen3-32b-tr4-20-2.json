  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow for a reader familiar with AI concepts. Sentences are generally logical and the flow mirrors the original dialogue. Minor issues such as duplicated speaker tags (e.g., “Camille: Camille: Entiendo”) and a couple of typographical glitches slightly hinder smooth reading, but the overall comprehension is not affected.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few literal renderings feel awkward (“es del bachotaje”, “Luc: Luc: Exacto”). Some punctuation and capitalization inconsistencies are present. Nevertheless, the language is fluent enough for native speakers to understand without effort.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “ventana de contexto”, “anclaje”. The word “prompt” is kept in English, which is common in the community. The only slight drawback is the unconventional use of “bachotaje” instead of a more idiomatic expression like “estudio intensivo”.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone. Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience, and the analogies (consultant, learning to ride a bike) are preserved. The duplicated tags and occasional literalness reduce the adaptation score marginally.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are retained: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the “memory” feature. No substantive information is lost.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the technical content effectively. It is readable and mostly fluent, with correct terminology and full information coverage. Minor typographical errors, duplicated speaker labels, and a few slightly unnatural phrasings prevent it from reaching a perfect score, but it remains a high‑quality rendition suitable for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience.\n\n**Strengths**: faithful to the source, proper handling of technical vocabulary, clear explanation of concepts.\n**Areas for improvement**: clean up duplicated speaker tags, smooth out literal translations (e.g., \"es del bachotaje\"), and ensure consistent punctuation and capitalization.\n\n**Suggested overall score**: 16/20."
