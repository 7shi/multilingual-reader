  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the main ideas are conveyed. However, there are several typographical quirks (e.g., duplicated speaker labels “Camille: Camille:” and “Luc: Luc:”), some literal constructions (“es bachotage”), and occasional awkward phrasing that slightly impede smooth reading. The sentence flow is mostly logical, but the repeated tags break the visual flow.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural expressions for a native speaker: “Imaginen que enviamos una nueva IA a la escuela…”, “La IA no ‘olvidó’ en el sentido humano; su espacio de trabajo temporal fue simplemente vacío”, and the retention of French words like “bachotage”. The use of “Es un truco?” instead of a more idiomatic “¿Es una artimaña?” also reduces naturalness. While the vocabulary is adequate, the overall fluency feels stilted.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “ICL”, and “grounding” (kept as “anclaje (grounding)”). Consistency is good. The only notable lapse is the untranslated French term “bachotage”, which could have been rendered as “estudio intensivo” or similar. Otherwise the terminology is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast discussion, using equivalents like “consultor brillante”. Cultural adaptation is modest but sufficient; no French‑specific idioms are left untranslated. The duplicated speaker tags detract from professionalism, and a few literal turns (e.g., “Vea más bien”) feel out of place in Spanish, but the overall message remains clear.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original. Minor stylistic redundancies exist, but they do not affect the completeness of the information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transferring the technical content of the podcast from French to Spanish. It conveys the main concepts accurately and keeps the technical terminology consistent. Nevertheless, the text suffers from several fluency issues, duplicated speaker labels, and occasional literal translations that feel unnatural in Spanish. Improving these stylistic aspects would raise the overall readability and naturalness considerably.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
