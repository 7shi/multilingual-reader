  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow for the intended audience. Sentences are generally short and the logical flow of the podcast dialogue is preserved. A few constructions are a bit wordy (e.g., “se trata de que parece que la IA recuerda…”) but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most of the text. Vocabulary is appropriate and the style matches a spoken‑podcast format. Some expressions feel slightly forced or literal (“es una trampa”, “informaciones”) and could be replaced by more idiomatic alternatives, which prevents a perfect score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: preentrenamiento, afinado (fine‑tuning), aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje (grounding). The author keeps the original English/French terms in parentheses, which helps readers who may know them. The only minor point is the use of “afinado” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”, but the meaning is clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original podcast tone, uses a friendly greeting, and adapts cultural references (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenidos!”). Minor stylistic tweaks could improve naturalness (e.g., “una forma ingeniosa” instead of “una forma astuta”), but overall the intent and purpose are faithfully conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive ideas are omitted. The only slight nuance loss is the rhetorical question “Es una trampa?” which changes the tone of “C’est une astuce ?”, but the overall meaning remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content clearly. It maintains the conversational podcast style and keeps the key terminology accurate. A few literal renderings and slightly awkward phrases prevent it from reaching a top‑tier score, but the text is fully understandable and faithful to the source.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
