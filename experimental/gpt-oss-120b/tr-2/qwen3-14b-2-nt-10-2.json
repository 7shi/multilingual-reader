    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version presents the dialogue in a clear, logical order. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained with examples that are easy to follow. The only small hiccup is the retained French interjection “D'accord.”, which may momentarily puzzle a Spanish‑only reader, but it does not hinder overall comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the text reads naturally, with appropriate connectors and a conversational tone that matches a podcast script. There are a few slightly awkward spots – notably the mistranslated gender in “ajuste fina” (should be “ajuste fino”) and the occasional literal borrowing of English terms like “prompt”. These do not break the flow but prevent the translation from feeling completely native.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “anclaje”. However, the translation of “fine‑tuning” as “ajuste fina” is grammatically incorrect, and the decision to keep “prompt” untranslated may be confusing for non‑technical listeners. Consistency could be improved, but the core terminology is understandable.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator has successfully adapted the original French intent to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using idiomatic expressions such as “como contratar a un consultor brillante”. Cultural references are maintained, and the script retains its engaging podcast style. The only minor lapse is the unchanged French phrase “D'accord.”, which would be more naturally rendered as “De acuerdo.”",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French dialogue is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The content remains concise and faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality and conveys the technical discussion clearly and engagingly. It captures the original’s educational tone and retains all essential details. Minor issues with gender agreement in a technical term and a leftover French interjection prevent a perfect score, but they do not materially affect understanding. With a quick edit of the few terminology slips, the text would read as fully native Spanish.\n\nOverall Score (average): 17.6/20"
