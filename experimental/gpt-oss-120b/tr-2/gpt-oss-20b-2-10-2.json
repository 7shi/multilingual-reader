  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the ideas clearly and the sentences, although sometimes long, are easy to follow. The explanations of concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto are understandable for a non‑expert audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, but a few expressions are literal translations that feel slightly awkward to native speakers (e.g., “el aprendizaje en contexto es un estudio a corto plazo”, “anclaje (enraizamiento)”). The vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, and there are no major grammatical errors.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, etc. The only questionable choice is “anclaje (enraizamiento)”, where “grounding” is usually rendered simply as “anclaje” or “enraizamiento” without the parenthesis, which may cause a slight inconsistency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator kept the informal podcast tone, preserved the original branding (Tech Éclair) and adapted cultural references appropriately. The dialogue feels natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience, and no French‑specific idioms were left untranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original script is present in the Spanish version. No key points are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The flow of the argument is preserved.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It transmits the technical content accurately while maintaining the conversational style of the podcast. Minor issues with a few literal phrasings and the handling of the term “grounding” prevent it from being perfect, but the text is readily understandable and faithful to the source. The scores reflect a strong performance across all criteria with slight room for improvement in fluency and terminology consistency."
