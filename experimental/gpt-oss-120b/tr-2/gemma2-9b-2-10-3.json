  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the dialogue flows naturally. However, a few awkward phrasings such as “pre‑entrenado” (instead of *preentrenamiento*) and the use of “el afianzamiento” for *fine‑tuning* create momentary confusion, slightly lowering readability.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural, but there are several lexical slips (“el afianzamiento”, “ancrage (grounding)”, “pre‑entrenado”) that a native speaker would avoid. These hiccups make the translation feel a bit mechanical.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly preserved (\"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"fine‑tuning\" → \"afinamiento\"). Nevertheless, inconsistencies appear: \"afianzamiento\" is not the usual Spanish term for fine‑tuning, and the French word \"ancrage\" is left untranslated instead of using \"anclaje\" or \"grounding\". This harms terminology precision.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the podcast’s branding (\"Tech Éclair\" → \"Tecnología Flash\") and keeps the conversational tone appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral and the intent of the original is maintained.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the concepts, examples, and analogies from the original script are present. No substantive information is omitted; only minor lexical inaccuracies affect precision, not content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast’s content accurately and maintains the educational tone. It is readable and mostly fluent, but several terminology choices and occasional awkward phrasing prevent it from reaching a higher level of polish. With a few revisions—especially standardizing technical terms and removing leftover French words—the text would be a strong, natural‑sounding Spanish version.\nOverall score: 72/100."
