  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. Most sentences are clear, and the complex concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, grounding) are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can grasp. Minor hiccups (e.g., occasional long sentences and a few missing accents) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural to native speakers: “¡Hola y bienvenido en…”, “aplastar en la víspera” for \"bachotage\", and the occasional literal translation of French idioms. The overall register is acceptable, but the awkward phrasing and a few grammatical slips reduce the naturalness of the text.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\" and \"grounding\" are all retained or properly rendered. Consistency is maintained throughout the dialogue, and the translator chose appropriate Spanish equivalents for most English/French jargon.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and the pedagogical tone of the podcast. However, some cultural‑linguistic choices are off (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en…”, “aplastar en la víspera”). These do not change the meaning but slightly weaken the adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French script is present. No major ideas are omitted, and the speaker turns are preserved. The translator even kept the parenthetical explanations for acronyms, which helps the reader. Redundancies are minimal, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content and the conversational style of the podcast. Readability and completeness are strong points, while fluency suffers from a few literal renderings and awkward idioms. Technical terminology is well‑handled, and the core message is intact. With minor stylistic polishing, the text would read like a natural Spanish podcast script.\n\n**Overall Score (average of the five criteria): 16/20**"
