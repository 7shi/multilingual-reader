  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are easy to follow. Even with a few minor awkward phrasings, a native reader can understand the discussion without effort.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are a few clunky spots: \"¿Por qué ya entiende…?\" (turns a statement into a question), \"se recuerda\" (incorrect reflexive), \"Entendieron todo\" (less formal) and \"informaciones\". These reduce fluency slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, grounding, etc., are correctly rendered and used consistently. The occasional phrasing error does not affect terminology.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and cultural relevance. Minor mis‑renderings (e.g., the question form) do not change the overall message, and the adaptation to Spanish‑speaking audience is appropriate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All core information from the French script is present. No significant content is omitted, and the only issues are small mis‑interpretations that slightly alter nuance but do not delete facts.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. It handles most terminology well and maintains the podcast’s explanatory style. A few grammatical and stylistic slips (notably the conversion of a statement into a question and the odd \"se recuerda\") prevent it from being flawless, but overall it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 17.4 ≈ 17/20.\n\nScore: 17"
