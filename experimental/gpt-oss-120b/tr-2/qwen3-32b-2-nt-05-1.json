  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the complex ideas about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. Minor hiccups such as occasional long sentences do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and the phrasing flows smoothly. A few stylistic quirks (e.g., “Miren:” as an interjection, the mixed use of French guillemets « » and occasional literal translations) are slightly odd but do not break fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (In‑Context Learning)”, etc. The translation keeps the meaning of each term and provides Spanish equivalents where needed, maintaining coherence across the dialogue.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast’s tone to Spanish‑speaking listeners, using familiar expressions and a suitable register. The title is changed to “Tecnología Clara”, which is a reasonable cultural adaptation, though the final reference to “Tech Éclair” reverts to the original French, creating a slight inconsistency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present. No concepts are omitted, and the explanatory examples are kept intact. The only minor loss is the inconsistency of the podcast name at the end, which does not affect the conveyed knowledge.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, reads smoothly, and respects the original intent. Minor stylistic issues (use of French quotation marks, occasional literal interjections, and inconsistent handling of the podcast title) keep it from being perfect, but they do not hinder understanding. The translation would be very effective for Spanish‑speaking listeners interested in AI concepts.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
