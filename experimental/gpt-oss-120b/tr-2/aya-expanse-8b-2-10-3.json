  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the technical ideas without excessive jargon, and the conversational tone of the podcast is preserved. A few sentences are slightly long or use literal translations (e.g., “joven graduado de la escuela” instead of “universidad”), which may cause a brief pause for the reader, but overall comprehension is not hindered.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most part, but there are occasional awkward phrasings (“Este proceso de aprendizaje inicia con un procedimiento”, “Es una observación excelente y fundamental entender”) and some literal word choices (\"afinamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\"). The mix of French name \"Tech Éclair\" with the later Spanish rendering \"Tech Relámpago\" also breaks the flow. Nonetheless, a native speaker would understand it without difficulty.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding → anclaje, afinamiento, etc. Consistency is maintained, and the terms are appropriate for a general‑audience podcast. The only minor issue is the choice of \"afinamiento\" which, while understandable, is less common than \"ajuste fino\".",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and purpose. Cultural adaptation is adequate; the speakers sound like podcast hosts in Spanish. The inconsistency of keeping the original French program name in the opening but switching to a Spanish version at the close could confuse listeners, but it does not alter the core message.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All relevant information from the French script is retained. No significant content is omitted, and the explanations remain faithful to the source. The only slight deviation is the name change mentioned above, which is stylistic rather than informational.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. Readability and completeness are strong, while fluency and cultural consistency could be refined. Minor lexical choices and the mixed program name are the main areas for improvement. The translation would be well understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\n**Total score (average):** 16.4/20 ≈ 16"
