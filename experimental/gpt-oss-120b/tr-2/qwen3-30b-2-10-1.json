    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. Sentence structures are mostly logical, but occasional informal words like \"cachear\" for \"cramming\" and occasional missing accents slightly affect smooth comprehension. Overall the reader can understand the content without major difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., \"Ustedes han comprendido todo\", \"Ustedes pueden tomar…\", over‑use of the formal \"Ustedes\" in a podcast setting). Some colloquial terms (\"cachear\") feel out of place. Vocabulary is appropriate, yet the flow could be more native‑like.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (aprendizaje en contexto)\". The translation of \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\" is acceptable and consistent. No major terminology errors were found.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent and tone are preserved, and the translation conveys the same message. Minor issues arise from the overly formal \"Ustedes\" pronoun, which may feel less natural for a casual podcast audience that might prefer \"tú\" or a mixed form. Otherwise, cultural references are unchanged and appropriate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant omissions or additions distort the meaning. The translation maintains the logical sequence of ideas and includes the same examples and analogies.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and faithfully conveys the technical discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency suffers from a few unnatural phrases and an overly formal pronoun choice. Minor lexical choices like \"cachear\" could be replaced with more standard terms. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a knowledgeable audience, needing only slight polishing for a more natural podcast tone.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 17/20."
