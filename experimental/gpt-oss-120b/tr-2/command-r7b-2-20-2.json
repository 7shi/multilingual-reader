  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. The sentences are not overly complex, and the speaker turns are clear. However, the translation adds a lot of extra explanatory material that was not in the original (e.g., “incluyendo textos, imágenes y videos”, “retroalimentación constante”). This makes the passage longer and occasionally redundant, which can slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The language sounds mostly natural, but there are several stylistic oddities: the frequent use of exclamation marks after \"Exacto\", the word \"ancoraje\" (the correct term is \"anclaje\"), and some clumsy phrasing such as \"Este proceso implica exponer a los modelos de IA a grandes cantidades de datos y retroalimentación constante para mejorar continuamente y aprender nuevas habilidades\" (repetitive use of \"continuamente\"). These issues make the text feel a bit stilted for native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, memoria a corto plazo, etc. The only notable mistake is the translation of \"grounding\" as \"ancoraje\" instead of the more common \"anclaje\" or \"enraizamiento\". Apart from that, the terminology is consistent throughout the translation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast style to Spanish well (e.g., \"¡Hola y bienvenidos!\"), and it respects the original intent. The added explanations do not distort the message, but they sometimes go beyond what was required, which can be seen as over‑explaining. Nevertheless, the cultural tone is appropriate and the overall purpose is preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the major points from the French original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the discussion of “memory” features. No essential information is omitted. The translation does introduce extra details that are not harmful, so the content remains complete.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and keeps the technical discussion intact. It reads fairly well for a Spanish‑speaking audience, though it suffers from occasional awkward phrasing and a minor terminology slip. The added explanatory content makes the text longer than necessary but does not obscure the core ideas. With a few stylistic tweaks (especially fixing \"ancoraje\" and smoothing punctuation), the translation would be of high quality.\n\nFinal average score (out of 20 per criterion): 78/100."
