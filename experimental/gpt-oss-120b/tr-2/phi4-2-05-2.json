  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear order. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in language that a non‑expert can follow. Minor hiccups (e.g., “el preentrenamiento” instead of “el pre‑entrenamiento”, occasional long sentences) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are a few awkward or region‑specific constructions: “cuando refinás un modelo” (vos form, not used elsewhere), “aprendizaje en contexto, o AIL” (the abbreviation is inconsistent with the original ICL), and occasional literal renderings such as “se convierte en un experto de sus datos”. These quirks lower the smoothness slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, anclaje, etc. The only notable issue is the change of the acronym ICL to AIL, which could confuse readers familiar with the English term. Consistency between “ajuste fino” and later “afinamiento” is a minor inconsistency, but overall terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the podcast’s conversational tone, uses appropriate Spanish discourse markers, and adapts cultural references (e.g., “consultor brillante”). The style remains engaging and the intent of the original is fully conveyed. Minor regionalisms do not detract from the overall adaptation.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as in the source. The only slight deviation is the acronym change (ICL → AIL), which is a superficial label rather than a loss of meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality, preserving the educational and conversational nature of the original podcast. It explains complex AI concepts clearly, uses appropriate technical vocabulary, and remains faithful to the source content. Minor issues with regional phrasing, acronym consistency, and occasional literalness keep it from being perfect, but overall it is a very effective and readable Spanish version.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 88"
