    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the original logical flow. However, occasional awkward constructions (e.g., “¡Bienvenido/a a …”, “Se inserta automáticamente estos extractos…”, inconsistent use of “sus/vuestras conversaciones”) and the incorrect term “atrición” for “grounding” slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are several moments that feel stilted or redundant. Phrases such as “¡Bienvenido/a”, “de forma automática” after already saying “automáticamente”, and the mix of formal/informal pronouns reduce native‑speaker fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical jargon (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, ICL) is correctly rendered. The main flaw is the mistranslation of “grounding” as “atrición”, which is not a recognized Spanish term for this concept.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and educational tone of the original podcast are preserved. Minor cultural mismatches (the introductory “¡Bienvenido/a” and occasional shifts between ‘usted’/‘vosotros’) prevent a fully idiomatic adaptation, but overall the message is conveyed appropriately.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version; no substantive information is omitted. The translation remains faithful while keeping the length comparable to the source.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of conveying the technical discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning. Readability and completeness are strong, but fluency and terminology suffer from a few awkward phrasings and the incorrect translation of the term “grounding”. With minor edits—especially replacing “atrición” with a proper term like “anclaje” or “enraizamiento”, smoothing out redundant expressions, and unifying pronoun usage—the text would read like a native‑speaker podcast script.\nOverall score (out of 100): 78/100."
