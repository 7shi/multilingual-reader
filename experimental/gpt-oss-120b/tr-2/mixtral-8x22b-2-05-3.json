  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences mirror the original structure and complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning) are explained clearly. A few constructions such as \"el marco de contexto de corto plazo\" are a bit clunky, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation sounds natural, but there are several awkward or non‑idiomatic choices: \"el afinamiento\" (more common would be \"ajuste fino\"), \"ancoraje\" instead of \"anclaje\", and the phrase \"el marco de contexto de corto plazo\" which feels literal. The abbreviation AIC is introduced without explanation, and some sentences are overly long. These issues lower the fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly rendered (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto). The translator kept English acronyms (ICL, AIC) and explained them, which is appropriate for a tech‑savvy audience. Minor inconsistencies (\"afinamiento\" vs. the more usual \"ajuste fino\") prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original tone (conversational, explanatory) and adapts cultural references well. The metaphor of a \"consultor brillante\" works nicely in Spanish. Slightly literal renderings (e.g., \"memoria a corto plazo\") could be smoother, but overall the intent and purpose are conveyed effectively.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the translator adds small clarifications (e.g., \"aprobar por librillo\" for \"bachoter\") that help understanding without adding redundancy.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is solid and faithful to the original. It conveys the technical concepts clearly and retains the podcast’s engaging style. Fluency could be improved by using more idiomatic Spanish terminology (e.g., \"ajuste fino\", \"anclaje\", \"ventana de contexto\"). The minor lexical choices prevent it from reaching a perfect score, but the text is highly readable and technically accurate.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20.\n\n**Final rating:** 17/20.\n\n**Strengths:** completeness, accurate technical terminology, clear explanations.\n**Areas for improvement:** idiomatic phrasing, consistent use of standard Spanish tech terms, smoother sentence flow.\n**Recommendation:** A light edit focusing on the few non‑native expressions would bring the translation to near‑native quality.\n\n**Final score:** 17"
