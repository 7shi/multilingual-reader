  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., \"bienvenido en\" instead of \"bienvenido a\", \"se convierte en tan inteligentes\") do not impede comprehension, but they slightly reduce smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several unnatural expressions and inconsistencies in register (mix of \"Usted\" and \"tú\", \"Usted ha entendido todo\"). Some phrases are literal translations that sound awkward to native speakers. Overall the text is understandable but not fully natural.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\". The only slight weakness is the use of \"afinado\" for \"fine‑tuning\", where \"ajuste fino\" would be more precise, but the meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and purpose, but the tone is inconsistent (formal vs. informal) and some idiomatic choices are off (e.g., \"interpretamos la tecnología\" instead of \"desciframos\" or \"analizamos\"). Cultural adaptation is adequate but could be smoother.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present. No significant ideas are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original. Minor redundancies are absent, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content of the podcast, retaining most terminology and the overall flow of the conversation. However, it suffers from occasional grammatical errors, register inconsistencies, and a few literal translations that feel unnatural in Spanish. Improving the naturalness of expressions and standardising the tone would raise the overall quality.\nOverall, the translation is good but not flawless, earning a respectable mid‑high rating.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 16/20."
