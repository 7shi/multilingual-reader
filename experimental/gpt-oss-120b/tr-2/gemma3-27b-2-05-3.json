  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto) are clear. A few word choices such as “pre‑capacitación” (less common than “pre‑entrenamiento”) and a slightly redundant phrase “Aprendizaje en Contexto (ICL), o aprendizaje dentro del contexto” slightly affect flow, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic (“consultor brillante”, “caja negra”, “ventana de contexto”). Minor awkwardness appears in some constructions (e.g., “la totalidad del historial de tu conversación” instead of a shorter “todo el historial”, and the repeated use of “memorización” where “memoria” might be smoother). Overall, a native speaker would find it fluid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”. The term “grounding” is left in English, which is acceptable in a tech podcast but could have been rendered as “anclaje”. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately (explanations of “Tech Éclair”, analogies with consultants, etc.). A small mismatch is the rendering of “learning on the fly” as “aprendizaje puntual”, which is not the most idiomatic choice, but the overall message remains intact.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present. No sentences or ideas are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary material. The content is concise yet complete.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and remains comprehensible for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor lexical choices (e.g., “pre‑capacitación”, “aprendizaje puntual”, leaving ‘grounding’ untranslated) prevent a perfect score, but they do not detract significantly from the overall effectiveness.\n\nStrengths: clear exposition of complex AI concepts, consistent terminology, faithful preservation of the podcast’s conversational tone.\nWeaknesses: occasional non‑idiomatic phrasing and a few terms that could be rendered more naturally in Spanish.\nOverall, the work demonstrates solid competence in both language and subject‑matter translation.\n\nOverall score (sum of the five criteria): 90/100."
