    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and conveys the original ideas clearly. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the examples (consultor brillante, aprender a andar en bicicleta) are preserved, aiding comprehension. A few long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but overall a Spanish‑speaking audience can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, but there are several awkward or non‑idiomatic choices: \"ajuste preciso\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\", \"fundamentación\" for \"grounding\" (\"anclaje\" would be preferable), redundant capitalisation in \"Aprendizaje en Contexto (AIC)\", and occasional inconsistency in the podcast name (\"Tecno Destello\" vs \"Tech Destello\"). These issues slightly disrupt the flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally preserved, but some are rendered with non‑standard Spanish equivalents. \"Fine‑tuning\" becomes \"ajuste preciso\" (less common), \"grounding\" is translated as \"fundamentación\" (unusual), and the abbreviation \"ICL\" is changed to \"AIC\" without explanation. While the meaning is still clear, a more consistent handling (e.g., keeping the English term in parentheses) would improve precision.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the dialogue to Spanish‑speaking listeners well, using culturally neutral language and appropriate analogies. The tone remains conversational and the educational intent is preserved. Minor issues such as the inconsistent podcast title do not significantly affect the overall message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the examples and explanations are retained. The only slight deviation is the change of the podcast name at the end, which is a minor branding inconsistency rather than loss of information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully conveys the original podcast script and its technical explanations to a Spanish‑speaking audience. It is clear and mostly fluent, with the core concepts intact. The main areas for improvement are the use of more idiomatic technical vocabulary (e.g., \"ajuste fino\", \"anclaje\") and consistency in naming (keeping the podcast title uniform). Overall, it is a solid translation with minor stylistic and terminology tweaks needed for a fully natural read."
