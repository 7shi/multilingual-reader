  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow; sentences are generally well‑structured and the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are clear. A few long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most of the script. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic, but there are occasional awkward repetitions (e.g., “aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (aprendizaje en contexto)”) and a couple of constructions that feel slightly stilted (“solicitud” instead of “prompt”). These minor issues prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “prompt”, etc. The translator kept English acronyms and provided Spanish equivalents, maintaining consistency throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original tone and intent well for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogies (consultant vs. permanent expert, cramming for an exam) are preserved. Minor phrasing could be tighter, but the overall message is conveyed effectively.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French version are present; no significant information is lost or added unnecessarily. The translation is faithful and concise while retaining the full content of the podcast script.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality. It communicates the technical concepts clearly, uses appropriate terminology, and respects the original conversational style. Minor repetitions and a few slightly awkward phrasing keep it just short of flawless, but the text is fully understandable and faithful to the source.\nOverall, the translation deserves a strong rating, reflecting its accuracy, readability, and naturalness.\nScore out of 20: 18/20 (average of the five criteria)."
