    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original logical flow. However, several awkward phrasings (e.g., “aplacar en la víspera”, “antiestación”) and occasional redundant expressions make it harder for a reader to follow smoothly.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound natural, but there are noticeable unnatural constructions, verb‑choice errors (e.g., “se acuerda” → “se acuerda”, “aplastar en la víspera”), and literal translations that feel forced. This reduces the overall fluency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto” and “aprendizaje en contexto” are correctly rendered. The term “grounding” is translated as “anclaje”, which is acceptable, but the mistranslation “antiestación” for “cheat‑sheet” shows a gap.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the podcast tone and uses appropriate formal address (usted). Cultural references are preserved, but some idiomatic choices are off, leading to a slightly less natural adaptation for Spanish‑speaking audiences.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the ideas, examples, and dialogue from the original French are present. No major content is omitted, and the structure mirrors the source.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full meaning of the original podcast and retains most of the technical content. Nevertheless, several lexical slips and unnatural phrasing prevent it from feeling completely native. With a few corrections (especially the mistranslated “antiestación”, the cramming metaphor, and verb agreements) the text would be much clearer and smoother.\nOverall, the work is solid but requires polishing to reach a high‑quality native level.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 14/20.\n\nOverall reasoning: Readability and fluency are hindered by a handful of awkward translations and literal renderings, while terminology and completeness are strong. Contextual adaptation is adequate but could be refined for idiomatic Spanish. These factors combine to give a moderate‑high rating, reflecting a competent but imperfect translation.\n\nScore: 14"
