  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas and the flow of the podcast dialogue is preserved. A few sentences are long and could be split for smoother reading, but overall a native reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward phrases (e.g., \"el proceso llamado el 'entrenamiento previo'\", \"se inserta automáticamente estos extractos en el prompt, de forma automática\", \"ajuste preciso\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\"). These moments break the fluidity for a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely well‑handled: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" are appropriate. However, \"ajuste preciso\" is a less common rendering of fine‑tuning, and \"fundamentación\" for \"grounding\" is not the usual term (\"anclaje\" or simply \"grounding\" is preferred). The acronym change from ICL to AIC could also cause confusion.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish, uses suitable salutations, and keeps cultural references neutral. The name of the show is rendered as \"Tech Destello\", which preserves the original wordplay. Minor issues (redundancies, slightly literal translations) do not affect the overall intent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present. No key points are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary content. The only minor drawback is occasional redundancy, which does not affect completeness.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is accurate and conveys the technical discussion clearly. It succeeds in maintaining the conversational style of the podcast and includes all essential information. The main areas for improvement are fluency (smoother phrasing) and terminology (using more standard Spanish technical terms). With slight revisions, the text would read as if originally written in Spanish.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
