  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are clear and the flow of ideas mirrors the original. A few long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but overall a Spanish‑speaking listener can understand the concepts without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic, and the dialogue style is preserved. Minor issues such as the retention of the French word “antisèche” and occasional mixed‑language tags (e.g., *fine‑tuning*) slightly break the fluency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “pre‑entraînement” → “entrenamiento inicial”, “fine‑tuning” → “ajuste fino”, “In‑Context Learning” → “aprendizaje en contexto”, “ventana de contexto” is correctly used, and explanations are kept. Consistency is maintained throughout, and where English/French terms remain they are clarified in parentheses.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original intent to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using familiar analogies (consultor brillante, aprender a montar en bicicleta). However, the word “antisèche” (a French term for “cheat‑sheet”) is left untranslated, which may confuse some readers. Aside from that, cultural adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is retained. No relevant detail is omitted, and the added parenthetical clarification at the end does not alter the meaning. The content remains comprehensive and faithful to the source.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content clearly, uses appropriate terminology, and preserves the conversational tone of the podcast. Minor lapses—such as an untranslated French term and occasional mixed‑language tags—prevent it from being perfect, but they do not significantly hinder comprehension. The text would be easily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners interested in AI concepts.\n\nThe translation scores well across all criteria, yielding an average of 17/20, indicating a strong, professional rendering with only small room for refinement.\n\nScore: 17/20"
