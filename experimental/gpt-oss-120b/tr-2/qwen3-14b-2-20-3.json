  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and the dialogue structure mirrors the original. Most sentences are clear, but a few awkward phrasings (e.g., \"crammar\", \"estudiar a última hora\") and occasional literal translations make the flow slightly stilted.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are noticeable errors such as the typo \"crammar\", inconsistent use of \"afinado\" vs. \"sintonización\" for fine‑tuning, and a few literal constructions that a native speaker would phrase differently.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well‑handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\" are appropriate. However, the term for fine‑tuning is inconsistent (\"sintonización\", \"afinado\"), which could confuse readers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. Cultural references are neutral and suitable for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Minor issues (the \"crammar\" mistranslation) slightly detract from the adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas and details from the French script are present. No significant information is omitted, and the logical progression of the discussion is maintained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and is understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. It would benefit from a careful proofread to fix typographical errors, ensure consistent terminology (preferably using \"ajuste fino\" for fine‑tuning), and smooth out a few literal translations that sound unnatural. With those refinements, the text would reach a higher level of fluency and readability.\n\nScore out of 20 (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
