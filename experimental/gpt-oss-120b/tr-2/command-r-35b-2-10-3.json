  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly short and the flow mirrors the original podcast script, making the concepts clear for a non‑expert audience. A few long, parenthetical explanations (e.g., the added definition of pre‑entrenamiento) add redundancy but do not impede comprehension. Minor typographical issues such as \"La IA\" instead of \"la IA\" are present but do not seriously affect readability.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several spots where the wording feels slightly forced or literal: \"el proceso llamado el « pretrainamiento »\", \"Es un mecanismo?\", and the over‑use of \"precisamente\". The mix of formal and colloquial registers is a bit uneven, and occasional awkward constructions (e.g., \"una estrategia ingeniosa para automatizar el aprendizaje contextual\") reduce overall smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana contextual\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\". The translator consistently uses the same Spanish equivalents throughout. The only minor inconsistency is the occasional use of the English‑style \"pretrainamiento\" instead of the standard \"preentrenamiento\".",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately for Spanish‑speaking listeners. The consultant analogy and the exam‑cramming metaphor are preserved. Some sentences were slightly expanded (adding explanations that were not in the original), which is acceptable for clarity but deviates from a strict literal adaptation. Overall the purpose and tone are well conveyed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No major facts are omitted, and the logical progression is intact. Redundant restatements appear (e.g., the repeated explanation of memory being temporary), but they do not cause loss of information. The translation does not add misinformation.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content of the podcast clearly to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor issues with phrasing, occasional typographical errors, and slight over‑explanation prevent it from being flawless, but the overall quality is high. It would benefit from a final proofread to smooth out the few unnatural expressions and to ensure consistent terminology, but it is readily understandable and faithful to the source.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17.2 ≈ 17/20."
