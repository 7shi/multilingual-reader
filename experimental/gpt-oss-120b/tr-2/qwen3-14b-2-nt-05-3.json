  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to follow. Sentences are short and the logical flow mirrors the original. Minor hiccups such as the untranslated French interjection \"D'accord.\" slightly disrupt comprehension, but the overall message remains clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, but there are a few awkward spots: the retention of \"D'accord.\" in Spanish dialogue, an unnecessary exclamation after it, and occasional punctuation quirks (e.g., \"¡Exactamente !\"). These issues prevent a fully native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\" are correctly rendered and used consistently. Retaining English words like \"prompt\" and \"grounding\" is acceptable for a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and tone, adapting cultural references appropriately. The main drawback is the lingering French phrase, which slightly breaks immersion for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Otherwise, the adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No ideas or examples are omitted, and the dialogue structure is preserved. The only minor loss is the untranslated \"D'accord.\", which does not affect factual content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality and conveys the technical discussion clearly. Minor lapses—chiefly the retention of a French interjection and a few punctuation oddities—prevent a perfect score, but the text remains comprehensible, technically accurate, and faithful to the source.\n\n**Total Score:** 87/100 (sum of the five criteria)."
