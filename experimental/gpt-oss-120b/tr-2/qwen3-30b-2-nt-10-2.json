  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are generally short and the concepts are explained clearly, mirroring the original podcast style. A few minor phrasing choices are a bit stiff (e.g., “simplemente su contexto temporal ha sido borrado”), but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native speaker in most places. Vocabulary is appropriate and the flow is smooth, though there are occasional literal renderings such as “pre‑entrenamiento” with a hyphen and the phrase “una hoja de resumen” which could be more idiomatic. Overall, the text reads well.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, etc. The only notable oddity is the translation of “grounding” as “fundamentación”, which is less common than “anclaje”. Consistency is otherwise good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original podcast tone to Spanish effectively, using familiar greetings and maintaining the conversational dynamic. Cultural references are neutral, and the style is appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve polish, but the intent is fully preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and the added explanations are faithful to the original. Redundancy is minimal and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content clearly, retains the original’s conversational tone, and is mostly fluent and natural. The main areas for improvement are a few lexical choices (e.g., “fundamentación” for grounding) and occasional literal phrasing that could be rendered more idiomatically. Nonetheless, the translation is accurate, readable, and suitable for the target audience."
