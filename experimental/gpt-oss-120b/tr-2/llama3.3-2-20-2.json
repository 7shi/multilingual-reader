  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow. Sentences are short and concepts are explained clearly. Minor hiccups appear in the dialogue turn where Camille asks “¿Es decir? or ¿Qué quieres decir?” which is confusing and could be simplified to a single natural question. Overall, a Spanish‑speaking listener would understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places and uses appropriate colloquial phrasing (e.g., “es como contratar a un consultor brillante”). A few expressions sound slightly awkward or redundant, such as “anclaje (enraizamiento)” and the meta‑comment at the end about keeping the original name. These do not break comprehension but reduce smoothness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje de transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL). The only questionable choice is “enraizamiento” for grounding, which is uncommon; “anclaje” alone would suffice. Nevertheless, the terminology is accurate and appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original intent well, using Spanish‑appropriate phrasing and cultural references. The explanatory style is preserved. The extra note at the end (“Tecnología Iluminadora …”) is unnecessary but does not alter the message. Overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is retained. No major ideas are omitted. Minor nuances, such as the phrase “memoria a uso único,” are softened to “memoria temporal,” which slightly changes the emphasis but the overall meaning stays intact. The content is complete and coherent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly to a Spanish‑speaking audience. It handles most terminology correctly and maintains the conversational tone. Small issues – a confusing double‑question, a rare term for \"grounding,\" and an unnecessary editorial note – keep it from being perfect, but they do not impede understanding. With a few tweaks, the text would be fully natural and precise.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
