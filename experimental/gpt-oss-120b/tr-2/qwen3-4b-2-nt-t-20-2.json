  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original French script. Most sentences are easy to understand, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in plain language. Minor issues affect smoothness (e.g., \"¡Hola y bienvenido en\" instead of \"¡Hola y bienvenidos a\", occasional redundancy like \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es el aprendizaje basado en contexto\"). These do not prevent comprehension but slightly reduce readability.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly sounds natural, but there are several awkward expressions and inconsistencies in register. Phrases such as \"Usted ha entendido todo\" (mixing formal 'usted' with a colloquial tone), the use of \"bienvenido en\" and occasional missing accents make the text feel slightly stilted for native speakers. Vocabulary choices are appropriate, yet the style oscillates between formal and informal, which hurts overall fluency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well. \"Pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\" are correctly rendered and used consistently. The term \"grounding\" is left in English, which is acceptable in a technical context. No crucial term is mistranslated or omitted.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast tone and intent. Small cultural‑linguistic mismatches (e.g., \"¡Hola y bienvenido en\") could be improved, and the mix of \"tú\"/\"usted\" creates a slight tonal inconsistency. Apart from those points, the content is well adapted for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No key idea, example, or nuance is lost. The translation even repeats some explanations, which, while redundant, does not omit content. Therefore the completeness is perfect.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original message accurately and includes all technical details. Readability and terminology are strong, but fluency suffers from occasional unnatural phrasing and register inconsistencies. Minor tweaks to idiomatic Spanish would raise the quality further. The work is solid and usable for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience, though a final proofreading pass is advisable to smooth out the few awkward constructions.\n\nFinal average score (out of 20): 18.0"
