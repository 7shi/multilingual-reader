    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the dialogue format is preserved. Minor awkwardness appears in phrases like “rango de contexto” and “partes de un contexto vacío”, which are understandable but not the most natural choices. Overall, a Spanish‑speaking reader can comprehend the concepts without difficulty.",

    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several literal renderings betray the source French. Examples: “rango de contexto” instead of the more common “ventana de contexto”, “optimización” for fine‑tuning, and “partes de un contexto vacío”. These give the text a slightly stilted feel to native ears, though the meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “anclaje (grounding)”. However, there is inconsistency – the fine‑tuning step is called both “ajuste preciso” and later “optimización”, which could confuse readers. The term “rango de contexto” is non‑standard, and “memoria a corto plazo” is less precise than “ventana de contexto”.",

    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone well and uses Spanish‑appropriate phrasing. The only notable issue is the inconsistent rendering of the podcast name: initially “Tech Éclair (Tecno Flash)” and at the end “Tecnología al Instante”. Apart from that, cultural references and analogies are preserved and understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",

    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, temporary vs permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No substantive information is lost, and the logical flow is kept. Minor lexical variations do not affect content completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and maintains the conversational style of the podcast. While the overall meaning is preserved, the text suffers from occasional literal translations and inconsistent terminology that affect fluency and technical clarity. Refining the terminology (e.g., using “ventana de contexto” consistently and choosing a single term for fine‑tuning) and smoothing out a few awkward phrases would raise the quality substantially.\n\nOverall rating: 79/100.\n\nRecommendations: \n1. Standardize technical terms (fine‑tuning → “ajuste fino”, context window → “ventana de contexto”).\n2. Ensure consistent naming of the podcast throughout.\n3. Revise slightly stilted sentences for a more natural flow.\n4. Keep the clear explanations and analogies, as they work well for the target audience."
