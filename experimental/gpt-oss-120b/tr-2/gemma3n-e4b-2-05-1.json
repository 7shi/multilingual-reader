  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the ideas are clearly presented. Sentence structures are logical and the dialogue format is preserved. The only slight hiccup is the mixed‑language greeting «¡Bonjour y bienvenida», which may momentarily confuse a pure‑Spanish reader, but it does not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and the phrasing is smooth. Minor stylistic quirks such as occasional long sentences and the occasional French word remain, but they do not feel awkward. Overall the flow is very good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, anclaje, etc. The terminology is consistent throughout and matches the level expected for a tech‑savvy podcast audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent, tone, and podcast‑style banter. Cultural references are minimal, so little adaptation is needed. Retaining the French brand name and the word «Bonjour» is acceptable, though a fully Spanish greeting could have been chosen for smoother localisation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All points from the original French script are present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and no extraneous material is added. The technical explanations remain intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, this is a high‑quality translation. It conveys the technical content accurately, reads naturally, and preserves the conversational feel of the podcast. Minor issues are limited to the occasional mixed‑language greeting and a few long sentences, but they do not detract significantly from the overall effectiveness of the translation.\n\nScore breakdown: readability 17, fluency 18, terminology 19, contextual adaptation 17, information completeness 20. The averaged overall score is 18/20, reflecting a strong translation with only small room for improvement.\n\nScore (overall): 18"
