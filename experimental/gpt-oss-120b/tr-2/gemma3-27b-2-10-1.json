    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly short and logical, and the dialogue format is preserved. A few constructions such as “rango de contexto” (instead of the more natural “ventana de contexto”) and the use of “optimización” for fine‑tuning are a bit less clear, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, but there are occasional awkward phrases (“rango de contexto”, “optimización” for afinamiento, “el pre‑entrenamiento, ¿de qué se trata?”) and some redundancy (“Aprendizaje en Contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”). Overall a native speaker would understand it, yet a few sentences feel slightly stilted.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely well‑handled: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “anclaje (grounding)”, “prompt”. The choice of “ajuste preciso” for fine‑tuning and “optimización” for the same concept is acceptable, though “afinamiento” would be more precise. “rango de contexto” is understandable but not the standard term. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast style to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using appropriate equivalents like “Tecno Flash” and “Tecnología al Instante”. Cultural references are kept neutral, and the explanatory tone is preserved. The slight change of the podcast title at the end introduces a minor inconsistency, but the overall intent is conveyed.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the original information is present: the discussion of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the “memory” feature. No major ideas are omitted, and the logical flow of the dialogue is intact. Minor lexical choices do not cause loss of meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content clearly. It is readable and mostly fluent, with only a few terminology and phrasing quirks that prevent it from being completely natural. The core concepts are preserved, and the adaptation to a Spanish‑language podcast format works well. Minor refinements (e.g., using “ventana de contexto” and “afinamiento”) would raise the quality further."
