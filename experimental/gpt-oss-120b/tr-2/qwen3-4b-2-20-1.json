  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the logical flow of the dialogue is preserved. However, there are several grammatical slips (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en”, “una cantidad masiva de datos en la Internet”, “muy menos de texto”, “reprobarle de nuevo los documentos”) and inconsistencies in pronoun use (mixing “tú” and “Usted”). These errors interrupt smooth comprehension, especially for readers not familiar with the source language.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural expressions and awkward phrasing that would sound odd to native speakers. Examples include “Hola y bienvenido en”, “Usted ha entendido todo”, and “muy menos”. The register shifts between formal and informal without clear reason. While most sentences are intelligible, the overall smoothness is compromised.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “anclaje (grounding)”. The term “prompt” is left untranslated, which is acceptable in this context. Consistency is good and the jargon matches the target audience’s expected knowledge.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and maintains the podcast‑style dialogue, but some cultural/linguistic adaptations are off. The podcast title is rendered as “Tech Luminosa”, which feels forced, and the inconsistent use of formal vs. informal address reduces the natural feel for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and explanations from the French source are present. No major information is omitted, and the structure mirrors the original. Minor lexical mistakes (e.g., “reprobarle” instead of “volver a proporcionar”) do not cause loss of meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in transmitting the full content and technical concepts, but its readability and fluency are hindered by several grammatical errors, unnatural phrasing, and inconsistent register. Technical terminology is well rendered, and no information is lost. A thorough copy‑edit focusing on idiomatic Spanish, consistent pronoun usage, and correction of minor lexical mistakes would raise the quality significantly.\nOverall score: 15/20."
