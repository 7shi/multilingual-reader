    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences convey the original meaning, and the technical concepts are explained clearly. However, there are a few typographical errors (e.g., “crammar” instead of a proper word) and occasional punctuation issues that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds a bit mechanical in places. Some expressions are literal translations (“el preentrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning” kept in English) and there are minor awkward constructions (e.g., “El afinamiento… es ahí donde entra en juego… ?”). The overall flow is acceptable but not fully natural for native Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled well: “preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “anclaje” are appropriate. Inconsistencies appear with “fine‑tuning” sometimes left in English and sometimes rendered as “afinamiento”. The handling is good but could be more uniform.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the intent and tone of the original podcast dialogue. Cultural references are neutral and thus transferable. Minor issues such as the typo “crammar” and some punctuation quirks reduce the adaptation quality slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas or examples are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original. Minor typographical errors do not affect the completeness of the content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of conveying the original discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning. It is mostly readable and complete, with accurate technical terminology. The main weaknesses are occasional unnatural phrasing, inconsistent handling of some English terms, and a few typographical errors that affect fluency. With a final polish—especially smoothing out literal translations and fixing the typo—the text would read like a natural Spanish podcast script.\nOverall score: 79/100."
