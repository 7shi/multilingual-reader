  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version follows the original structure and conveys the concepts clearly. Sentences are generally well‑ordered and the dialogue format is preserved, making it easy for a Spanish‑speaking audience to follow. A few very long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but overall comprehension is not hindered.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, but there are a handful of awkward choices: “pre‑formación” is not the usual term (pre‑entrenamiento), “perfeccionamiento” sounds a bit forced for fine‑tuning, and there is a stray punctuation mark (\"…La IA hace lo mismo. “,\") that breaks the flow. Aside from these minor hiccups, the language is smooth and idiomatic.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely appropriate: “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “ajuste fino” (although translated as “perfeccionamiento”) and “anclaje” are correct. The main issue is the use of “pre‑formación”, which is not standard in Spanish AI literature. Consistency is maintained, but a few terms could be replaced with more common equivalents.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts the content well for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the explanatory style remains intact. No meaning is lost, and the examples (consultant analogy, bike‑learning) work equally well in Spanish.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the dialogue flow is preserved. The only minor flaw is the stray punctuation that suggests a tiny truncation, but the surrounding text still conveys the intended meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the technical discussion effectively. It is readable and faithful to the source, with only a few lexical choices that could be refined (e.g., “pre‑formación” → “pre‑entrenamiento”, “perfeccionamiento” → “ajuste fino”) and a minor punctuation glitch. The translator succeeded in maintaining the podcast’s conversational tone and the clarity of complex AI concepts.\n\nStrengths: completeness, clear exposition of concepts, good adaptation of analogies. \nAreas for improvement: adopt standard AI terminology, smooth out a couple of long sentences, fix stray punctuation.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
