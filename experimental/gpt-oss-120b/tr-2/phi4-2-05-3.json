  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in plain language, making the content accessible to a broad audience. A few minor hiccups (e.g., the unexplained acronym “AIL” instead of the original ICL) slightly hinder immediate comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation reads naturally, but there are several awkward constructions: “aprendizaje automatizado en contexto”, the switch to the “vos” form in “refinás”, gender disagreement in “ha sido borrada”, and the inconsistent use of acronyms (ICL → AIL). These errors prevent the text from feeling completely smooth to a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly (preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto). However, the acronym for in‑context learning is changed to “AIL”, which is inaccurate and could confuse readers. The term “prompt” is left unchanged, which is acceptable, but the inconsistency in the acronym lowers the score.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the dialogue to Spanish‑speaking listeners well, preserving the podcast‑style tone and providing culturally neutral examples. The only drawback is the occasional regionalism (“vos”) that may not match all Spanish‑speaking audiences, but it does not alter the intended meaning.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French script is retained. No major ideas are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary repetition. The only slight loss is the confusion created by the wrong acronym, but the factual content remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and is easy to understand for Spanish readers. It succeeds in keeping the educational tone and the step‑by‑step explanation of AI learning methods. Minor fluency issues, an inconsistent use of pronouns, gender agreement errors, and the mistaken change of the ICL acronym to AIL are the main areas for improvement. Overall, it is a solid translation with room for polishing to reach native‑speaker quality.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 78"
