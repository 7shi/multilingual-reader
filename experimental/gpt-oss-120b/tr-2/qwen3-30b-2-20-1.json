  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall easy to follow and the ideas are clearly expressed. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., *« A menudo se percibe estas IA »* should be *« se perciben »*) do not impede comprehension, and the sentence flow is logical.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but a few awkward constructions appear: missing articles (*« es allí donde interviene aprendizaje por transferencia »*), the use of *« Porque »* instead of *« ¿Por qué »*, and occasional inconsistency between *tú* and *usted*. These reduce the native‑speaker feel slightly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled very well: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *ICL*, *prompt*, *grounding*. The only tiny point is the decision to keep *prompt* in English, which is acceptable in a technical context.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original to a Spanish‑speaking audience smoothly, using appropriate phrasing and cultural references. Minor formality issues (mix of *usted* and *le*) are present but do not affect the overall intent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is retained. No relevant detail is omitted, and the examples (English‑French transfer, consultant analogy, memory feature) are fully preserved.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version is a high‑quality translation. It conveys the technical content accurately and is largely readable and natural, with only a handful of small grammatical or stylistic lapses. Terminology is consistent and the original message is preserved in full. With minor polishing of articles and pronoun consistency, it would be near‑perfect.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.4/20, rounded to 18/20."
