  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are long but maintain logical flow, and the main ideas are conveyed without ambiguity. Minor hiccups such as the redundant exclamation in the final title and a few overly‑long sentences slightly affect smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are a few awkward choices: the use of the French term *ancrage* instead of a Spanish equivalent, the phrase *ventana de contexto* (acceptable but less common than *ventana de contexto*), and the leftover English parenthetical note at the end. These reduce the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is mostly well handled – *pre‑entrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *fine‑tuning* rendered as *afinamiento*, *In‑Context Learning* kept as ICL, etc. The only notable lapse is keeping *ancrage* (grounding) in French, which could confuse readers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapted titles (Tech Éclair → TecnoRelámpago) and kept the conversational tone appropriate for a podcast. Cultural references are preserved, and the overall intent is maintained. The leftover English note and the mixed‑language title at the end are minor mismatches.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original script is present; no ideas or explanations are omitted. The translation even adds a parenthetical clarification, which does not detract from completeness.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. It reads well for a Spanish‑speaking audience, though a few lexical choices (e.g., retaining the French term *ancrage* and the stray English note) prevent it from being completely natural. Technical terms are mostly appropriate, and the content is fully retained. Minor refinements would bring it to a near‑perfect level.\nOverall score: 16/20."
