    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original French script. Most sentences are easy to understand, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener could follow. However, an English note about an alternative translation is left in the body, and the podcast name is changed to “Tecnoluz” at the end, which can confuse readers. These glitches lower the smoothness of comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward constructions: the imperative \"Observen\" does not match the singular speaker, redundant phrasing \"insertar automáticamente en el prompt de manera automática\", and occasional literal translations that feel stiff. Vocabulary is appropriate, but the flow is occasionally stilted, preventing a fully native‑like reading experience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and the abbreviation ICL are correctly rendered and kept consistent. The decision to keep \"prompt\" in English is acceptable in a tech‑savvy context. Minor issues are negligible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone, adapting the explanations for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Nonetheless, the inclusion of an English editorial note and the change of the podcast title to \"Tecnoluz\" reflect a lapse in cultural/branding adaptation. Aside from those, the content respects the target audience’s expectations.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary nature of prompts, and the simulated \"memory\" feature. The only noticeable loss is the original podcast name and the stray English comment, which are minor but affect completeness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and successfully transmits the technical discussion to a Spanish‑speaking audience. It handles terminology consistently and keeps the logical structure of the original dialogue. Minor editorial oversights—such as an untranslated English note, a changed podcast title, and a few unnatural phrasing choices—prevent it from reaching the highest level of polish. With a few revisions, the text would be both fully fluent and perfectly adapted for the target listeners.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 16/20."
