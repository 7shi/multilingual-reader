  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear, step‑by‑step manner that mirrors the original French script. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in plain language, making the content easy to follow for a non‑expert audience. Only a few sentences are a bit long, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are a handful of minor syntactic oddities that a native speaker would likely rephrase (e.g., \"Se denomina este enfoque aprendizaje en contexto\" instead of \"Este enfoque se denomina aprendizaje en contexto\", \"se le ha dado una pista justo antes de empezar a hablar contigo\"). These do not break understanding but affect smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)*, *anclaje (grounding)*, *memoria*. The occasional parenthetical English term is appropriate for a podcast audience that may be familiar with the original jargon. No mistranslations of technical concepts were detected.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational, podcast‑like tone is preserved, and cultural references are neutral enough to work for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Expressions such as \"¡Una analogía perfecta!\" and \"consultor brillante\" keep the lively style. Minor wording choices could be refined, but the intent and register are well conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information present in the French original appears in the Spanish version. No key points were omitted, and no unnecessary repetitions were introduced. The translation maintains the same structure and logical progression as the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It faithfully transmits the technical content and the lively podcast atmosphere, with only occasional awkward phrasing that could be smoothed out. Technical terminology is handled correctly, and the complete meaning of the original is retained. Minor edits would bring fluency to a perfect level, but as it stands the translation is clear, accurate, and appropriate for the target audience.\n\n**Total score (average): 18.2 / 20**"
