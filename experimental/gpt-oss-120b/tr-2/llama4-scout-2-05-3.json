  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the structure of the original dialogue. However, there are several interruptions from translation‑process notes (e.g., “or Es decir, ¿a qué te refieres? for a more conversational tone.”) and inconsistent hyphenation such as “pre‑entrainamiento”, which force the reader to pause. The flow is therefore slightly hindered, though the main ideas remain clear.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound natural, but a number of awkward constructions remain: “Mire, más bien:”, “El pre‑entrainamiento”, and the inclusion of English words or meta‑comments break the native feel. Verb choices and word order are occasionally literal translations from French rather than idiomatic Spanish.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely handled correctly. Key concepts such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"transfer learning\", \"in‑context learning (ICL)\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"grounding\" are retained or explained. The only notable issue is the misspelling/hyphenation of \"pre‑entrainamiento\" and occasional mixing of English terms without clarification.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast’s informal, conversational tone and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., using \"Hola y bienvenidos\"). Nevertheless, the presence of translator notes inside the dialogue detracts from a seamless adaptation to the target audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is conveyed; no substantive content is omitted. The only additions are the translator’s side comments, which do not remove any original meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the core content and technical depth of the original French podcast and generally respects the informal style appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, the inclusion of internal translation instructions and a few non‑idiomatic expressions lower its overall polish. Cleaning up the meta‑comments and refining awkward phrasing would significantly improve readability and fluency, bringing the translation closer to a native‑level product.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
