  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall clear and easy to follow. Sentences are mostly logical and the concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can grasp. Minor hiccups (e.g., occasional overly long sentences) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally but contains several literal renderings and awkward expressions such as “pre‑formación”, the stray quotation mark after “La IA hace lo mismo. “,” and occasional word order that feels translated rather than original Spanish. These issues lower the smoothness for native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly handled: “fine‑tuning” → “perfeccionamiento”, “in‑context learning” → “aprendizaje en contexto”, “grounding” → “anclaje”. The only minor lapse is the use of “pre‑formación” instead of the more common “pre‑entrenamiento”, but the meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and podcast style. Cultural references are unchanged, which is appropriate. Some phrasing is overly literal, but overall the adaptation fits a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present. No substantive information is lost, and the structure mirrors the original. The only defect is a stray punctuation mark that does not affect meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the original content accurately and maintains the educational, conversational tone of the podcast. While the terminology is solid and the information complete, fluency suffers from a few literal translations and minor typographical artefacts. With slight polishing—especially replacing “pre‑formación” with “pre‑entrenamiento” and fixing stray punctuation—the text would feel fully natural to native speakers.\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 87/100."
