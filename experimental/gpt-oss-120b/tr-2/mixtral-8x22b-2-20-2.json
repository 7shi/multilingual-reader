  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version flows logically and the sentences are easy to follow. Complex ideas such as pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia and aprendizaje en contexto are explained clearly, making the content accessible to a broad audience. Minor hiccups (e.g., occasional over‑formal “Usted” in a casual podcast tone) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural; idiomatic expressions are well‑chosen and the dialogue feels conversational. A few awkward phrasings appear, such as “Usted ha entendido todo” (should be “Usted ha entendido todo” or “Has entendido todo”) and the literal retention of “ancrage”. These do not break fluency but slightly reduce naturalness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly correctly rendered (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto). However, “afinamiento” is less common than the standard “ajuste fino”, and the French word “ancrage” is left unchanged instead of using the Spanish “anclaje”. Consistency is good but a couple of terms could be improved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately. The podcast style is maintained, and explanations are adapted for Spanish‑speaking listeners. The only drawback is the occasional formal register (“Usted”) that feels out of place in a casual tech podcast.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No essential points are omitted, and the technical explanations remain intact. Redundancies are not introduced, and the content stays concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality: it conveys the technical content clearly, remains largely natural, and keeps the original message intact. Minor terminology choices (e.g., retaining the French ‘ancrage’ and using ‘afinamiento’ instead of the more common ‘ajuste fino’) and a slightly formal tone prevent a perfect score, but these issues are small and do not affect overall understanding.\nOverall rating: 17/20."
