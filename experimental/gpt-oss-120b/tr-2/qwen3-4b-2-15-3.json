  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure. Most sentences convey the ideas clearly, but there are a few awkward phrasings such as “Hola y bienvenido en” (should be “bienvenido a”) and occasional over‑long sentences that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural to a native speaker: mixed use of formal (“Usted”) and informal (“has”) pronouns, literal translations like “aprendizaje de último momento”, and punctuation errors. The flow is acceptable but not fully native‑like.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely accurate: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”. The translation of “grounding” as “anclaje” works, and most jargon is kept consistent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent, but cultural and stylistic adaptation is limited. Phrases like “Hola y bienvenido en” and inconsistent pronoun usage reduce naturalness for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present. No significant omissions or additions; the content remains faithful to the source.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full content and handles technical terminology well, but it suffers from fluency issues, inconsistent register, and some literal phrasing that makes it feel less natural. A polishing pass to harmonize pronouns, improve idiomatic expressions, and correct minor grammatical errors would raise the overall quality significantly.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 15/20."
