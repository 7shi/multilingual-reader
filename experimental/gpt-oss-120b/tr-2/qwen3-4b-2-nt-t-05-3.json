  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall understandable and the main ideas are conveyed clearly. However, there are several awkward phrasings (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenido en…\", \"Usted ha entendido todo\", \"cuando usted afinan un modelo\") and mixed registers that slightly hinder smooth comprehension. The sentence structures are often long, mirroring the French source, which can make the flow a bit heavy for native readers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many non‑native constructions, inconsistent use of \"tú\" vs \"usted\", and literal translations of French idioms (e.g., \"es del bachotage\"). These issues make the text feel stilted and occasionally confusing. While a Spanish‑speaking audience can follow the content, the naturalness is compromised.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly rendered correctly (preentrenamiento, afinación, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL). The term \"grounding\" is translated as \"anclaje\", which is acceptable, but some French words such as \"bachotage\" remain untranslated, and a few phrases like \"modelo especializado\" could be more precisely \"modelo experto\". Consistency is decent but not perfect.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts most examples to a Spanish‑speaking audience (e.g., \"consultor brillante\"). Cultural references are appropriate, but the mixed formal/informal tone and occasional literal renderings slightly reduce the adaptation quality.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the technical flow is retained. Minor stylistic redundancies exist, but they do not affect the completeness of the content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation faithfully transmits the content and technical concepts of the original podcast script, but it suffers from inconsistent register, several grammatical slips, and a few untranslated French terms that affect fluency and naturalness. While a Spanish‑speaking listener would grasp the message, the text could be polished to achieve a smoother, more native feel.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 15/20."
