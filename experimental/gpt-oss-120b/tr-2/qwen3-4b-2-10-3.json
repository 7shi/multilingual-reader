  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can understand. Minor hiccups such as “en la internet” and occasional long sentences slightly affect smooth reading, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward or non‑idiomatic expressions (“Hola y bienvenido en”, “Usted ha entendido todo”, mixed formal‑informal register). Vocabulary choices are appropriate, yet the occasional literal phrasing makes the flow feel a bit stilted.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: preentrenamiento, afinamiento (fine‑tuning), aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), grounding/anclaje, etc. The translator kept the original English acronyms and gave Spanish equivalents where needed, maintaining consistency throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience is good overall. Cultural phrasing could be improved (“Hola y bienvenido en” → “Hola y bienvenidos a”), and the register should be consistent, but the intent and tone of the original podcast are preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas or details are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary material. The content remains faithful and complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast content accurately and maintains the educational tone. Readability and terminology are strong points, while fluency and register consistency could be polished. Minor lexical tweaks would make the Spanish version feel more natural, but overall it is a high‑quality translation that delivers the complete message without loss of information.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria) : 16.8/20 ≈ 17/20."
