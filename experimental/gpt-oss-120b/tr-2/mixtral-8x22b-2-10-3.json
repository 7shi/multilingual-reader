  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. Most sentences are clear, but occasional mismatches in pronoun use (e.g., \"Cuando abre una nueva ventana, comienzas…\") and the inclusion of an English parenthetical at the end slightly disrupt comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few expressions feel forced or overly literal (e.g., \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\", \"¡Destellos Tecnológicos!\", and the mixed‑language closing). These reduce the smoothness expected from a native‑speaker text.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"ICL\" are correctly rendered. However, the French word \"ancrage\" is left untranslated (only shown in parentheses), and the English note at the end is unnecessary, which slightly harms consistency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast style well for a Spanish‑speaking audience, preserving the explanatory tone. Minor cultural‑linguistic slips (the leftover French/English terms) prevent a fully polished adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the original information and dialogue are present; no substantive content is lost. The only redundancy is the bilingual closing, which does not affect the core message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original French script accurately and retains the educational tone of the podcast. It is readable and largely complete, but occasional literal translations, inconsistent terminology (some French words left in), and a few awkward phrasings prevent it from reaching native‑level fluency. Minor edits—especially translating or explaining \"ancrage\" and removing the mixed‑language closing—would bring the text to a higher quality level.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 78/100."
