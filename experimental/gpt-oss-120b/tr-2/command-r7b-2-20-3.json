  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original flow. Most sentences convey the ideas clearly, but the translation includes several overly long and redundant sentences (e.g., the repeated explanation of “preentrenamiento” with “retroalimentación constante”). These make the script a bit harder to follow, especially for listeners, but the core message remains accessible.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are noticeable unnatural expressions and grammatical slips: “La afinar…”, “ancoraje” (instead of *anclaje*), excessive use of exclamation marks, and occasional literal translations of French punctuation (« »). The style is sometimes too enthusiastic for a podcast script, and a few sentences feel stilted. These issues reduce the overall naturalness for native Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, and *ICL* are correctly rendered and used consistently. Minor errors appear with “ancoraje” and the mistranslation of “affinage” as “La afinar”. Overall, the terminology is appropriate for a general‑audience technical podcast.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the greeting and podcast framing well to a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, it adds extra explanatory material not present in the original (e.g., “Estas modelos se entrenan con grandes cantidades de datos y retroalimentación constante…”). While these additions are not harmful, they slightly drift from the original intent and tone.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No crucial information is omitted; the extra sentences are supplementary rather than substitutive.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in conveying the technical content of the original podcast and retains most of the structure. Readability is acceptable, but fluency suffers from several grammatical mistakes and an overly verbose style. Terminology is largely accurate, though a few terms need correction. The added explanatory passages, while helpful for novices, diverge from the source’s concise tone. Overall, the translation is functional but would benefit from tightening the language, fixing grammatical errors, and removing unnecessary repetitions to achieve a more natural, podcast‑ready Spanish version.\n\nScore (sum of the five criteria): 74/100."
