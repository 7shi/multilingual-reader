    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in a straightforward manner. A few very long sentences could be broken up, but overall a Spanish‑speaking reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several slightly awkward constructions (e.g., “en lugar de enviarle a realizar un programa de formación de varios años”, “ventana de contexto (ICL)”, mixing French “Bonjour” with Spanish). Vocabulary is appropriate, yet occasional phrasing feels literal rather than idiomatic, which prevents a fully native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally well handled: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”. The only minor inconsistency is the use of “ventana de contexto (ICL)” which mixes two different concepts, and the translation of “grounding” as “anclaje”, a less common term in Spanish AI literature. Nevertheless, the terminology is consistent and understandable.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast discussion. Some cultural‑linguistic choices could be smoother (e.g., keeping “Bonjour” may feel odd for a Spanish‑only audience, and certain idioms could be more localized). Overall, the message is conveyed correctly, but adaptation could be tighter.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French source is present. No key points are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue. Minor lexical variations do not affect meaning, and there is no loss of nuance.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. Readability and completeness are strong, while fluency and contextual adaptation show room for improvement, especially in smoothing out literal translations and ensuring consistent use of technical acronyms. Technical terminology is mostly appropriate, though a few terms could be refined for a Spanish‑speaking AI audience.\nOverall, the work is commendable and would be easily understood by the target audience, with only modest polishing needed for native‑level naturalness.\n\nOverall score (out of 20): 16.2 → rounded to 16.\n\nOverall rating: 16/20."
