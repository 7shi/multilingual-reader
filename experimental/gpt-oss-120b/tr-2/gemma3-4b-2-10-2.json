    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is mostly understandable and the flow of the conversation is preserved. However, a few sentences are confusing or incomplete (e.g., “¿es en este punto donde entra en juego?” missing the term «apprentissage par transfert», and “¿Entendido?” which changes the original meaning). Minor grammatical slips (e.g., “Las conocimientos”) also slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds generally natural, but there are several awkward or ungrammatical constructions: gender agreement errors (\"Las conocimientos\", \"Los nuevas conocimientos\"), odd phrasing like “¿es una estrategia?” instead of “¿es una astucia?”, and literal translations of French idioms that feel forced. These issues lower the overall fluency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\" and \"grounding\" are correctly rendered. Nevertheless, inconsistency appears (\"ajuste\" vs \"afinamiento\"), and the key term \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" is omitted in Camille’s question, which reduces terminological completeness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally preserves the original intent and tone, and adapts cultural references appropriately. Yet, some nuances are lost (e.g., the notion that the model \"does not start from zero\" is omitted, and the subtle distinction between \"memoria temporal\" and \"memoria a uso único\" is not fully conveyed). Overall, the adaptation is adequate but not perfect.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the factual content is present, but several important details are missing or altered: the explicit mention of \"apprentissage par transfert\" in Camille’s line, the statement that the model \"does not start from zero\", the clarification that the AI has not \"forgotten\" in the human sense, and the exact phrasing of some analogies. These omissions affect completeness.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the spirit of the podcast and conveys the main ideas about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning. However, it suffers from occasional missing fragments, grammatical errors, and slightly unnatural phrasing. Technical terminology is mostly correct, but consistency could be improved. A revision to fix the omitted parts, correct gender agreements, and smooth out the wording would raise the quality significantly."
