  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are expressed clearly. Sentences are generally well‑structured, making the technical discussion easy to follow for a non‑specialist audience. Minor hiccups (e.g., slightly long sentences, occasional repetition) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, but a few phrasing choices feel a bit stiff or uncommon for native speakers (e.g., “funciones de memorización”, “una hoja de trucos”). The occasional literal rendering of French idioms (e.g., “bachelor” → “bachotar”) is acceptable in context, yet more idiomatic Spanish alternatives could improve smoothness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, etc. Consistency is maintained throughout the script. The choice of “anclaje” for “grounding” is acceptable, though a brief parenthetical explanation could help readers unfamiliar with the term.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish‑speaking listeners (e.g., greeting “¡Hola y bienvenidos!”). Cultural references are neutral and therefore appropriate. The analogy of a consultant and the bike‑riding metaphor are preserved correctly. Minor lexical tweaks could make it feel even more local, but the overall intent is faithfully conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No key points are omitted, and no irrelevant material is added. The structure mirrors the source, preserving the logical progression of concepts.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It delivers the complex ideas of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning in clear, understandable Spanish. Minor stylistic adjustments could raise fluency, but the terminology is accurate, the content complete, and the adaptation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience."
