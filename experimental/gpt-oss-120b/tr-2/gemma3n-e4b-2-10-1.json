  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas are easy to follow. Most sentences are well‑structured, but a few minor issues affect smooth comprehension: the mixed use of \"¡Bonjour\" (French) with Spanish, the plural \"informaciones\" (instead of the more natural singular \"información\"), and occasional gender or article mismatches. These do not obscure meaning but slightly reduce ease of reading.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural to a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and technical terms are handled well. However, there are register inconsistencies (mix of \"usted\" and \"tú\"), some awkward phrasing (e.g., \"se le dan las informaciones\"), and the occasional literal translation that feels stiff. Overall, the flow is good but not completely seamless.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is accurately rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje\". The term \"prompt\" is kept in English, which is acceptable for the target audience. Consistency is maintained throughout the text.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast tone and intent, adapting cultural references appropriately. Minor issues include the hybrid greeting \"¡Bonjour y bienvenida\" and the inconsistent use of formal/informal pronouns, which can slightly affect the perceived audience alignment. Otherwise, the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French source is present. No significant content is omitted, and the explanations remain faithful to the original. The translation even adds a small clarification in a few places, but this does not alter the intended message.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. It handles most terminology correctly and retains the educational tone of the podcast. The main drawbacks are minor stylistic inconsistencies and occasional unnatural phrasing, which prevent it from achieving a perfect score but do not impede understanding.\n\nScore (out of 100): 88/100"
