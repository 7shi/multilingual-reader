  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and follows the logical flow of the original podcast script. Most sentences convey the ideas clearly, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can follow. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., \"bienvenido en\" instead of \"bienvenido a\", occasional missing accent marks) slightly hinder smooth reading but do not obscure meaning.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward constructions: \"le proporcionarle\" (redundant pronoun), mixed use of English terms (fine‑tuning) alongside Spanish equivalents, and a few literal translations that feel stiff (e.g., \"ventana de contexto\" works, but the surrounding phrasing can be smoother). These issues make the text feel slightly stilted for a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well overall. \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje\" are appropriate. The occasional retention of the English word \"fine‑tuning\" is a minor inconsistency, but the meaning remains clear. The translation maintains consistency in most key terms.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The tone of a podcast conversation is preserved, and cultural references are neutral enough to work in Spanish‑speaking contexts. Minor issues such as \"Hola y bienvenido en\" instead of a more idiomatic \"Hola y bienvenidos a\" slightly affect naturalness, but the original intent and purpose are clearly conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the examples (e.g., English‑to‑French transfer, consultant analogy) are retained. The only losses are minor stylistic nuances, not factual content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and captures the educational intent of the podcast. Technical concepts are correctly rendered, and the overall message is preserved. Fluency and stylistic polish are the main areas for improvement, especially regarding consistent use of Spanish terminology and smoothing out a few literal translations. With minor editing, the text would read as a natural, professional Spanish podcast script.\nOverall score (out of 100): 82/100."
