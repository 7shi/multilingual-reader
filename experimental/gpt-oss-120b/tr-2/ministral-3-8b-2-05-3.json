  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and complex concepts are explained in clear language. The introductory note about keeping the French phrase in italics adds a slight distraction, but it does not impede comprehension. Overall, a Spanish‑speaking reader can understand the content without major effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, using appropriate Spanish constructions. A few literal renderings (e.g., \"revelar cómo… alcance tal nivel\", \"El afinamiento tiene como objetivo desarrollar una habilidad duradera\") feel slightly stiff, and the parenthetical explanations sometimes break the flow. Nevertheless, the language is fluent enough for native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL*, *grounding*, *prompt*, etc., are either translated correctly or kept in the original with clear parenthetical explanations. Consistency is maintained throughout the text.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original intent and tone of the podcast dialogue. Cultural references are neutral, and the occasional explanatory note (about possibly keeping the French intro) shows awareness of the target audience. Minor improvements could be made to streamline such meta‑comments, but the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and the translation does not add irrelevant material. The content remains complete and faithful to the original.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, uses appropriate terminology, and remains comprehensible for Spanish readers. The main areas for improvement are minor stylistic tweaks to increase naturalness and to remove the slightly intrusive introductory note about retaining the French phrase. With these adjustments, the text would read as a smooth, fully native‑speaking podcast script.\n\n**Overall score (average of the five criteria)**: 17.2 ≈ 17/20."
