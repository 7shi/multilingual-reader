  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences are clear, but there are occasional redundancies (e.g., the double explanation of pre‑entrenamiento) and a few awkward constructions that slightly interrupt the flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but some phrases are literal translations from French and feel odd to native speakers (e.g., \"Lenguaje de Modelado de Contexto Grande\", \"aprendizaje basado en situaciones\"). Vocabulary is appropriate overall, yet the inconsistency between \"refinamiento\" and \"afinamiento\" creates a minor hiccup.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are correctly rendered. However, the inconsistent use of \"refinamiento\" and later \"afinamiento\" for the same concept, and the unconventional \"Lenguaje de Modelado de Contexto Grande\", reduce consistency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adds useful clarifications for a Spanish‑speaking audience (e.g., explaining \"cajas negras\"). Cultural references are maintained, and the tone stays conversational. The extra explanatory bits improve comprehension without distorting the original intent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the added explanations do not alter the meaning. Minor stylistic repetitions are present but do not cause loss of information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and remains understandable for Spanish listeners. It captures the educational tone and the technical concepts well, though occasional literal phrasing and inconsistent terminology prevent it from being completely seamless. Overall, it is a solid translation that would be well received after minor polishing.\n\nStrengths: clear exposition of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning; good contextual explanations for a non‑technical audience.\nWeaknesses: occasional unnatural expressions, redundancy, and inconsistent rendering of the same technical term.\n\nA modest revision focusing on fluency and term consistency would bring the text to a near‑native level.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria, rounded): 16/20."
