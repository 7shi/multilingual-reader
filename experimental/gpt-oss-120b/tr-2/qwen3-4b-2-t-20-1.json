  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the original structure. Most sentences convey the intended meaning, and the dialogue format is preserved. However, there are several grammatical slips (e.g., \"las conocimientos\", \"estudiar a la vuela\") and occasional awkward phrasing that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds semi‑natural to a native speaker. Some expressions are literal translations that feel odd in Spanish (e.g., \"el afinamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\", \"Usted ha entendido todo\" lacking exclamation, \"El aprendizaje en contexto es el estudio rápido\"). These issues make the flow feel stilted in places.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\". The only notable drawback is the translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"afinamiento\", which is understandable but not the standard term in Spanish AI literature (\"ajuste fino\"). Consistency is otherwise good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogies (consultant, student, cyclist) are kept. Minor phrasing choices (e.g., \"Se puede decir así\") are slightly informal but do not distort the message.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the logical progression of the discussion is maintained. The only minor loss is the nuance of the French expression \"une compétence permanente\" which is rendered correctly but could be emphasized more.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is faithful and conveys the full content of the original podcast script. It succeeds in explaining complex AI concepts in a conversational manner. Nevertheless, the text contains several grammatical errors and some unnatural word choices that reduce readability and fluency. Technical terminology is mostly appropriate, though a more idiomatic term for \"fine‑tuning\" would improve precision. Overall, it is a solid translation that would benefit from a careful proofreading pass to polish the language.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 15.8 → 16/20."
