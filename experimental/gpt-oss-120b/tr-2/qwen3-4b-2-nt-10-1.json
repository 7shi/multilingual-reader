  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly logical and the complex ideas about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained clearly. A few awkward phrasings (e.g., “es una excelente puntualidad”) slightly hinder smooth comprehension, but they do not block understanding.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds largely natural, but occasional literal renderings betray the source language (“es una excelente puntualidad”, “aprendizaje superficial”). Vocabulary is appropriate and the dialogue flow is preserved, yet a native speaker would notice the odd expressions.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “Preentrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (Aprendizaje en contexto)”, “anclaje”, etc., are correctly translated or left in the original when standard. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone of a podcast conversation. Cultural references are neutral, and the explanatory style is kept. The only notable mis‑step is the literal “puntualidad” which does not fit the intended meaning of “observation/question”.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No major information is omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as in the source. Minor wording quirks do not result in loss of content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and faithful to the source. It communicates the technical concepts clearly and retains the conversational dynamic of the podcast. A few unnatural phrases (especially \"es una excelente puntualidad\") prevent it from being completely fluent, but they do not affect the overall understanding. With minor edits to improve naturalness, the translation would be excellent.\n\nFinal average score: 16.6/20 (rounded to 17/20)."
