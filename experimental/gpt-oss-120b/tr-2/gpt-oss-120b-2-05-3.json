  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are generally short and the logical flow mirrors the original. Complex ideas such as pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, transferencia de aprendizaje and aprendizaje en contexto are explained with clear examples. Minor hiccups (e.g., occasional formal \"Usted\" among otherwise informal tone) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker, using appropriate vocabulary (\"ventana de contexto\", \"memoria de un solo uso\", \"consultor brillante\"). A few expressions feel slightly literal – \"Usted lo ha comprendido todo\" (mixed register) and \"bachotaje\" (uncommon, though understandable). Overall the text flows smoothly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". The translator kept the original English acronyms where needed and provided Spanish equivalents consistently. No mis‑translations of technical concepts were found.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapted the content to Spanish‑speaking audiences, using inclusive \"bienvenid@s\" and culturally neutral examples. The tone matches a podcast script, and the explanation style is appropriate for a general‑public audience. Only a slight inconsistency in pronoun form (formal vs. informal) slightly reduces the adaptation score.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No key points are omitted, and no unnecessary repetitions were introduced. The translation faithfully preserves the structure and detail of the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains readability, and adapts well to the target audience. Minor stylistic issues (formal‑informal mix, a few literal phrases) prevent a perfect score, but the work is nonetheless clear, natural, and technically sound.\n\n**Total score (average of the five criteria):** 18.2 → rounded to **18/20** overall.\n\n**Strengths:** precise terminology, complete information transfer, clear explanations. **Areas for improvement:** ensure consistent register throughout and replace rare words like \"bachotaje\" with more common equivalents (e.g., \"estudio intensivo\")."
