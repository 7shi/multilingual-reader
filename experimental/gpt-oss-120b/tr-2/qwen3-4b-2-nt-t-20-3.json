    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Most sentences convey the original ideas without confusing structures. Minor grammatical slips such as \"¡Hola y bienvenido en\" instead of \"¡Hola y bienvenido a\" and occasional long sentences slightly affect flow, but the overall comprehension is good.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward or overly formal expressions (e.g., \"Usted ha entendido todo\", \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\"). The mix of formal \"Usted\" with the informal tone of a podcast creates a slight mismatch. Nevertheless, native speakers would understand it without major difficulty.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" are all appropriate. The only slight shortcoming is keeping \"grounding\" in English rather than providing a Spanish equivalent (e.g., \"anclaje\"), but the meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and explanatory style. Cultural adaptation is minimal but adequate. The use of formal \"Usted\" diverges from the casual podcast voice of the French original, and small phrasing issues (\"bienvenido en\") reduce the natural fit for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is retained. No ideas are omitted, and the logical sequence of the discussion is preserved. Redundancies are minimal and do not affect clarity.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. Readability and completeness are strong points. Fluency and contextual tone could be polished, especially by aligning the register with the informal podcast style and fixing minor grammatical errors. Technical terminology is mostly spot‑on, with only a small gap regarding the untranslated term \"grounding\".\n\nScore (out of 100): 86"
