    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the logical flow of the original dialogue. Most sentences are clear, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can follow. However, the inclusion of meta‑commentary (e.g., “Esta traducción parece adecuada…”) and occasional slash symbols disrupt the reading experience, forcing the reader to filter out irrelevant material.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly sounds natural, but there are several awkward constructions: “Ella lo olvida todo” feels clunky, “Es una forma astuta de aprendizaje contextual” would be more idiomatic as “ingeniosa”, and the repeated “Exactamente/Exacto” at the start of sentences feels mechanical. The added explanatory sentence about transfer learning is acceptable but not part of the original script, which makes the flow less smooth.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”. Consistency is maintained throughout. Minor issues include the translation of “grounding” as “anclaje”, which is acceptable, and the use of “memoria a corto plazo” instead of the more common “memoria de contexto”. Overall, terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original conversational tone to Spanish and respects cultural expectations. Nevertheless, the presence of explanatory parenthetical remarks about translation choices (e.g., “Si se considera que ‘astuce’…”) is out of place for a podcast script and detracts from the intended purpose. Some expressions are overly literal (e.g., “es como contratar a un consultor brillante…”) but remain understandable.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the main ideas of the original are retained, and the technical explanations are present. The added definition of “aprendizaje por transferencia” is extra information, not an omission. However, the meta‑commentary about translation decisions introduces irrelevant content, and a few minor nuances (e.g., the subtle difference between “consultor temporal” and “experto permanente”) are slightly blurred by the added wording. Thus, completeness is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core message of the podcast and correctly renders most technical terminology. It is readable and mostly fluent, but it suffers from unnecessary meta‑commentary and occasional awkward phrasing that make it feel less polished than a native‑speaker script. Removing the editorial notes, smoothing out the clunky sentences, and keeping the focus strictly on the dialogue would raise the quality substantially."
