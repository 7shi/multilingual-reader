  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and complex concepts are explained with suitable examples. Minor hiccups (e.g., \"Es como enviar a la IA para especializarse\" and the added parenthetical explanation of the podcast name) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most of the script, but a few expressions feel slightly forced or literal (e.g., \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\", \"el pre‑entrenamiento\" rendered as \"entrenamiento inicial\"). Overall, a native speaker would understand it without effort, though a few tweaks could improve smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled appropriately: \"fine‑tuning\" → \"ajuste fino\", \"In‑Context Learning\" → \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\" is kept, and \"grounding\" is explained as \"conexión a la realidad\". Consistency is maintained throughout. The only slight deviation is the use of \"entrenamiento inicial\" instead of the more common \"pre‑entrenamiento\", but the meaning is preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the conversational podcast tone and adapts cultural references suitably for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The added parenthetical \"(una mirada rápida a la tecnología)\" at the end is an unnecessary embellishment but does not distort the original intent. Overall, the purpose and style are well conveyed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant details are omitted, and the added clarification about the podcast tagline does not remove any content. Redundancy is minimal, and the translation stays faithful to the source.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid overall. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the podcast’s informal yet informative style, and is easily understood by Spanish readers. Minor lexical choices and a few slightly literal renderings prevent it from being perfect, but they do not hinder comprehension. A few small edits—especially smoothing out a couple of awkward phrases and using \"pre‑entrenamiento\"—would raise the quality to an excellent level.\n\nOverall score (sum of the five criteria): 87/100."
