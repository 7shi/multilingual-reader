  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the main ideas are clear. Sentence structures are similar to the original, which helps comprehension. A few minor phrasing issues (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en” instead of “Hola y bienvenidos a”) slightly hinder flow, but they do not obscure meaning.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural for native speakers: mixing formal \"Usted\" with informal \"tú\", the phrase \"Hola y bienvenido en\", and occasional literal translations such as \"la silla\" for a bike. Vocabulary is appropriate, but the inconsistency makes the text feel slightly stilted.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\". The translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"afinación\" is acceptable, though \"ajuste fino\" would be more common. Overall term usage is consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone, but cultural/linguistic adaptation is imperfect. Some literal renderings (e.g., \"la silla\" instead of \"la bicicleta\") and mixed registers reduce naturalness for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary content. The completeness is therefore high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full content of the podcast script and uses correct technical vocabulary, but it suffers from several fluency and adaptation issues that make it feel slightly artificial. Minor lexical choices and register inconsistencies prevent it from sounding completely natural to native Spanish listeners. Overall, it is a solid, understandable translation that would benefit from a careful edit to smooth out the awkward phrasing and ensure consistent formality throughout.\nScore (out of 100): 76/100."
