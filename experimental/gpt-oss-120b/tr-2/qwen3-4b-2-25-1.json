  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are conveyed clearly. Sentence structures are mostly logical, and the complex concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. Minor punctuation issues and occasional long sentences slightly hinder flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural or are inconsistent in register (e.g., mixing \"Usted\" and \"tú\", \"el afinamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\", \"es del cramming\"). There are also a few grammatical slips (\"no se afinan\", \"Usted ha entendido todo\"). These affect the smoothness for native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and appropriate: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"anclaje\". The translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"afinamiento\" is acceptable though not the most common. The term \"prompt\" is left untranslated, which is fine for a technical audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural adaptation is adequate, but the inconsistent use of formal/informal address and a few literal translations (e.g., \"consultor brillante\" → \"consultor destacado\") slightly reduce naturalness for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present. No substantive information is omitted, and the logical progression of the discussion is maintained. Minor phrasing differences do not cause loss of meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is faithful and conveys the technical content well, but it would benefit from a thorough copy‑edit to smooth out awkward phrasing, ensure consistent register, and correct a few grammatical errors. Terminology handling is solid, and the overall message is preserved.\n\nOverall, the translation is good but not yet fully polished for native‑speaker fluency.\n\nOverall score (average): 16/20."
