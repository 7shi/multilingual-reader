    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Sentences are generally clear, and complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto are explained with simple examples. The only minor drawback is the introduction of the abbreviation “AIC”, which is not common and may require a moment of clarification for the reader.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and the dialogue style is maintained. A few phrases feel slightly forced (“una cantidad mucho menor de texto en francés”, “Aprendizaje en Contexto (AIC)”), but they do not break the flow. Overall the text reads smoothly to a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”. The choice of “anclaje” for “grounding” is acceptable though not the most common translation, and the switch from the standard abbreviation ICL to “AIC” may cause confusion. Consistency is maintained, but a few alternative terms could be more idiomatic.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast tone, the conversational back‑and‑forth, and cultural references (e.g., “¡Exactamente!”, “¡Una analogía perfecta!”). The content is adapted well to a Spanish‑speaking audience, and no cultural mismatches are evident.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present. No essential idea is omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as in the original. The only slight redundancy is the double mention of “Aprendizaje en Contexto (AIC)”, but this does not affect completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content clearly, retains the lively podcast style, and is easily understandable for Spanish readers. Minor issues are the unconventional abbreviation “AIC” and a few lexical choices that could be refined, but they do not detract significantly from the overall effectiveness of the translation.\n\nScore: 85/100."
