  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original. Most sentences are easy to understand, and complex concepts are explained similarly to the French version. Minor issues such as the untranslated French interjection \"D'accord.\", a missing accent in \"¿Porque\", and occasional register shifts (mix of \"Usted\" and \"tú\") slightly reduce smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, but there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., \"Usted ha entendido todo\", inconsistent use of formal/informal pronouns, extra space before an exclamation mark). These hiccups prevent the text from feeling completely native.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\", and \"anclaje\" are appropriate and consistent. No crucial term is mistranslated or omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural references are neutral and appropriate for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The main drawback is the occasional shift between formal and informal address, and the leftover French phrase, which slightly weakens adaptation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is lost; only a tiny French interjection remains untranslated, which does not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. It is readable and mostly fluent, with good handling of specialized vocabulary. Small stylistic inconsistencies and a few minor typographic errors keep it from being perfect, but they do not hinder comprehension. The work would benefit from a final proofread to harmonize the register and fix minor punctuation/accents issues.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 17/20.\n\nScore: 17"
