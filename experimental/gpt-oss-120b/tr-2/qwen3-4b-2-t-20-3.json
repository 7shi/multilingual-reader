  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow and the dialogue format is preserved. Most sentences are clear and the technical ideas are explained in a way that a non‑expert can grasp. Minor issues such as the formal “Usted ha entendido todo” (instead of a more natural “¡Lo has entendido!”) and occasional long sentences slightly hinder flow, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several awkward or unidiomatic expressions: “Usted ha entendido todo”, “Se tiene la impresión”, and the mistranslation “a la vuela” for the French idiom “à la volée”. The mix of formal and informal registers (Usted vs. tú) is inconsistent. Overall the translation sounds understandable but not completely natural to a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well. “Pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (In‑Context Learning)” and “grounding” (translated as “anclaje”) are appropriate and consistently used. The only slight deviation is “afinamiento” for “fine‑tuning”, which is acceptable in Spanish technical discourse.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original’s informative tone and adapts it to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the conversational style is kept. The occasional overly formal “Usted” could be softened, but it does not distort the intent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memoria” features. No essential information is omitted; only minor phrasing quirks appear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and retains the educational tone of the podcast. It excels in terminology and completeness, but it suffers from occasional unidiomatic phrasing and a few mistranslations that affect fluency. With minor stylistic revisions the text would read as a natural Spanish podcast script.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 84/100."
