    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the logical flow of the original dialogue. However, several sentences are overly long or redundant (e.g., “Comienza antes de que la IA comience…”) and some phrasing feels clunky, which can momentarily hinder smooth reading. Overall, a native reader can grasp the content, but the flow is not optimal.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation reads naturally, but there are notable awkward constructions and minor grammatical slips: \"el IA\" (should be \"la IA\"), mixed French word \"connaissances\", occasional unnatural verb choices (\"ya había oído\"), and a few missing accents. These issues prevent the text from feeling fully native‑like.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly rendered correctly (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, ICL). Nonetheless, consistency suffers: \"afinamiento\" vs. \"ajustado con precisión\", and the term \"ancrage\" is left as a meta‑comment instead of a clean translation. The occasional retention of French words (\"connaissances\") detracts from terminology appropriateness.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator added helpful explanatory sentences (e.g., the definition of pre‑entrenamiento) which aid comprehension for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Yet, the inclusion of a meta‑comment about how to translate \"ancrage\" is out of place for the target audience and breaks the conversational tone. Some French‑style constructions remain, reducing cultural adaptation.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential ideas from the original French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the description of “memory” features. No major points are omitted, and the added clarifications do not distort the original meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and is largely complete, making it useful for Spanish‑speaking listeners. However, it is marred by inconsistency in terminology, occasional grammatical errors, and a few unnecessary meta‑comments that interrupt the natural flow. Improving term consistency, fixing minor language errors, and removing editorial remarks would raise the overall quality to a near‑native level."
