    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure, allowing readers to grasp the main ideas. However, there are several minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasing (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en”, “en la internet”, “Mire:” instead of “Mira:”) that slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains a number of unnatural expressions that would feel odd to a native speaker: “es del aplastar” instead of a proper idiom, inconsistent use of “usted”/“tú”, misplaced commas, and occasional literal translations that break the flow. While the overall meaning is clear, the lack of idiomatic language reduces fluency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"anclaje\" are correctly rendered and consistent. The term \"prompt\" is left untranslated, which is acceptable for a tech‑savvy audience. No major terminology errors.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast’s conversational tone and intent. Some cultural adjustments (e.g., use of formal \"usted\" vs informal \"tú\") could be refined for a consistent voice, but overall the content is appropriate for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present. No key ideas or examples are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary content. The only minor loss is the nuance of some rhetorical questions, but the factual content remains intact.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original message and technical content accurately, but it suffers from several fluency and readability issues that make it feel slightly stilted. Terminology is solid and the information is complete, yet the wording could be more natural and idiomatic for Spanish listeners. Overall, it is a competent translation that would benefit from a native‑speaker polish to improve flow and consistency.\n\n**Total score (out of 100): 80**"
