  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is overall easy to follow and the ideas are conveyed, but there are several small grammatical slips (e.g., “bienvenido en”, “IA total”, missing question marks) and occasional awkward phrasing that slightly hampers smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains a mix of formal and informal registers (\"usted\" vs. \"tú\"), literal renderings that sound odd in Spanish (\"bacotaje\", \"una IA total\"), and a few missing accent marks. Native speakers would notice these unnatural constructions, though the meaning is still clear.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"In‑Context Learning (ICL)\" and \"grounding\" are preserved or accurately translated. The term “transfer learning” is rendered as \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", which is appropriate. Consistency is good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and explains concepts for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but some expressions are overly literal and miss cultural nuance (e.g., formal \"Usted\" in a casual podcast, the uncommon word \"bacotaje\"). Overall the purpose is conveyed, but a smoother adaptation would improve it.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present in the Spanish version; no significant ideas are omitted or altered. Minor stylistic differences do not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transmitting the technical content of the podcast, and the listener can grasp the concepts presented. Nevertheless, the text suffers from several linguistic inaccuracies and occasional register mismatches that prevent it from feeling fully natural to a native Spanish audience. Polishing the phrasing, unifying the register, and correcting minor grammatical errors would raise the overall quality considerably.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 16/20.\nOverall score (out of 20): 16"
