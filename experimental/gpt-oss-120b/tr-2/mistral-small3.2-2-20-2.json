    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and the flow of ideas is easy to follow. Most sentences are well‑structured, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can grasp. Minor clunkiness (e.g., “AIC (Aprendizaje en Contexto)” and occasional literal phrasing) prevents a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, using idiomatic Spanish. There are a few awkward constructions (e.g., “Es una forma ingeniosa de Aprendizaje en Contexto automatizado”, the switch from «Tech Éclair» to «Tech Destello», and the unconventional abbreviation AIC). These issues lower fluency slightly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, grounding → anclaje, etc. The main drawback is the change of the original abbreviation ICL to AIC, which is not a standard Spanish acronym and may confuse readers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, adapting the metaphor of a consultant appropriately for Spanish‑speaking listeners. The slight renaming of the podcast to «Tech Destello» is a reasonable cultural adaptation, though not strictly necessary.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present; no ideas or sentences are omitted. The only nuance lost is the exact original abbreviation, but the meaning remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. Readability and completeness are strong, and the terminology is mostly accurate. Fluency and consistency of technical abbreviations could be improved, but the text would be readily understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nStrengths: clear explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning; good use of analogies; consistent style.\nWeaknesses: occasional literalness, non‑standard abbreviation (AIC instead of ICL), minor unnatural phrasing, and the podcast title change which, while not wrong, deviates from the original branding.\n\nThe translation would benefit from a final proofread by a native speaker familiar with AI terminology to smooth the few rough spots and align abbreviations with common usage.\n\nScore (out of 100): 80/100."
