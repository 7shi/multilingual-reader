  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are clear. Minor hiccups (e.g., omission of “ventana de contexto”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few literal turns (“Fíjese más bien”, “el preentrenamiento”) feel slightly awkward to a native ear. Vocabulary is appropriate, yet the phrasing could be smoother in places.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, grounding → anclaje, prompt → indicación, etc. Consistency is maintained, and the chosen Spanish equivalents are standard in the AI community.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts well to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using a localized podcast title (“Tecnología Rápida”) and appropriate cultural references. The overall intent and tone of the original are preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are present. No substantive information is lost; only minor lexical differences (e.g., not explicitly mentioning “ventana de contexto”) that do not affect the conveyed message.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical concepts accurately, remains largely readable and fluent, and respects the target audience’s context. Minor stylistic refinements could raise fluency, but the work is solid and faithful to the source material.\nScore: 88/100."
