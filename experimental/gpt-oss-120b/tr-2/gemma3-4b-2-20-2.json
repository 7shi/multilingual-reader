    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but many formatting artefacts ( stray braces, asterisks, misplaced quotation marks) and duplicated words (e.g., \"IA es como una IA\") interrupt the flow. Some sentences are oddly phrased (\"Es común que percibamos estas IA como cajas negras, pero cómo aprenden sigue un proceso real.\") which can cause momentary confusion. Overall, a native reader can grasp the meaning, but the presentation hampers smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several awkward constructions and punctuation errors. Examples include missing commas, incorrect use of \"pero cómo\" and the presence of stray symbols (\"}**\"). The translation sometimes uses literal translations that sound unnatural in Spanish. While most vocabulary is correct, the overall text does not read as a polished native‑speaker script.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"fine‑tuning\", \"transfer learning\", \"in‑context learning (ICL)\", \"grounding\" and \"memory\" are rendered correctly (\"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\"). The translation keeps the English acronyms, which is appropriate for a tech audience. Minor gaps exist (the notion of \"fenêtre de contexte\" is omitted), but terminology handling is largely accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the general intent of the podcast, using familiar Spanish phrasing for a tech‑savvy audience. However, some contextual nuances are lost: the reference to the previous episode about Transformers is omitted, and the opening remark about the subject being \"fascinant\" is changed to \"es común\". These omissions slightly weaken the alignment with the original’s narrative flow.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the factual content is present, but several pieces of information are either missing or truncated. Notably, the line about the discussion of Transformers and the logical bridge before introducing the new approach is absent. Additionally, stray markup characters distract and sometimes hide content. Consequently, the translation is not fully complete.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the core ideas of the original French podcast and uses appropriate technical vocabulary. Nevertheless, it suffers from numerous editorial oversights (stray symbols, missing punctuation) and a few content omissions that affect readability, fluency, and completeness. With careful proofreading and restoration of the omitted sentences, the quality could be raised to a professional level.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14/20."
