  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and the flow of ideas follows the original script. Most sentences are clear, but occasional awkward constructions (e.g., “Así es la realidad de la Inteligencia Conversacional Limitada (ICL)”) slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural to a native speaker: inconsistent use of “tus”/“vuestras”, the literal translation of “the ideal way to pose the problem” → “La forma ideal de abordar el problema es.”, and the odd rendering of ICL. These issues make the translation feel a bit stilted.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as «pre‑entrenamiento», «ajuste fino», «aprendizaje por transferencia» and «aprendizaje en contexto» are correctly translated and consistently used. The main flaw is the mistranslation of the acronym ICL as “Inteligencia Conversacional Limitada”, which is inaccurate and could mislead readers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the informal podcast tone and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., “consultor brillante”). However, some literal renderings and the inconsistent pronoun choice reduce the natural adaptation for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the original French script are present; no major information is omitted. Minor phrasing differences do not affect the conveyed content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation conveys the original message accurately and retains most of the technical detail. The main shortcomings are the inaccurate translation of the ICL acronym, occasional awkward phrasing, and inconsistent use of second‑person pronouns. With a few revisions to improve fluency and terminology precision, the translation would be excellent for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience.\n\n**Total Score:** 82/100"
