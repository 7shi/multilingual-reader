  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original French script. Most sentences are easy to understand, and the technical concepts are explained in a straightforward way. Minor issues such as occasional clunky phrasing (“se inserta automáticamente en el prompt de manera automática”) and the inclusion of an editorial note (“Alternatively, for a more fluid integration…”) slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural to a native speaker, using appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic expressions. There are a few awkward repetitions and a mismatch in the podcast name at the end (“Tecnoluz” instead of “Tech Éclair”). These affect the overall smoothness but do not break comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, etc. The term “prompt” is left in English, which is acceptable in the current AI‑related discourse. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience effectively, preserving the explanatory tone and analogies. The only notable mis‑adaptation is the change of the podcast’s name to “Tecnoluz” and the stray editorial comment, which feel out of place in a spoken podcast.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are retained, including the distinction between fine‑tuning and in‑context learning, the explanation of memory features, and the concluding call‑to‑action. The change of the podcast name is a small factual loss, and the extra parenthetical note adds noise but does not remove essential information.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original message accurately and is largely understandable for Spanish listeners. It handles the technical material competently and keeps the explanatory style. Minor stylistic glitches, a mis‑named podcast title, and an unnecessary editorial insert prevent it from being perfect, but the core content is intact and well presented.\n\nScore breakdown: Readability 16, Fluency 15, Terminology 18, Contextual Adaptation 16, Information Completeness 17 → Total 82/100.\n\nThe translation is solid and would work well with minor post‑editing to fix the repetitions, remove the stray note, and correct the podcast name.\n\nOverall rating: 82/100."
