  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure, but there are several moments where the sentence is unfinished or clunky (e.g., “En lugar de 'cajas negras', podríamos decir que sus algoritmos o mecanismos aprenden a través de...”). Minor grammatical slips (\"inmensas conocimientos\", \"por tanto\") also slightly hinder smooth reading. Overall, a native reader can grasp the content, but the flow is occasionally disrupted.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many expressions sound unnatural for a Spanish‑speaking audience: “ancraje” (should be *anclaje*), “almacenamiento de conocimiento a largo plazo” (normally just *memoria*), and the overly literal translation of some conversational turns. The mix of “ustedes”/“vuestras” and occasional awkward phrasing reduces the naturalness, though the majority of the text is fluent enough for comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly kept (preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL). However, there are notable inaccuracies: *ancraje* instead of *anclaje*, the use of “almacenamiento de conocimiento a largo plazo” where the original simply says “Memoria”, and occasional inconsistency in the handling of English abbreviations. The translation does not always provide the brief explanations that would help a non‑expert audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator attempts to adapt the podcast style, but some choices feel literal rather than culturally adapted (e.g., “Tech Luz” instead of preserving the original brand name, which may confuse listeners). The pacing and length of sentences are sometimes too long for spoken Spanish, and a few idiomatic expressions are missing or awkward, but the overall intent and tone are preserved.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No significant sections are omitted, and the logical flow of arguments remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core ideas of the original French podcast accurately and retains most of the technical content. Nevertheless, it suffers from several linguistic slips, inaccurate terminology, and a few stylistic choices that feel unnatural in Spanish. Improving the handling of key technical terms, polishing sentence structures, and better adapting the style for a Spanish‑speaking listening audience would raise the overall quality considerably."
