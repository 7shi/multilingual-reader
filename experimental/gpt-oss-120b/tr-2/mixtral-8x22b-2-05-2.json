  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall clear and easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the dialogue format is preserved. Minor hiccups such as “marco de contexto de corto plazo” instead of the more common “ventana de contexto” slightly affect smoothness, but the reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward expressions (“marco de contexto de corto plazo”, “AIC (In‑Context Learning)”, “aprobar por librillo”) that a native speaker would phrase differently. Vocabulary is appropriate, yet the mix of English acronyms and literal translations sometimes feels forced.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding, etc. The choice of “afinamiento” for fine‑tuning is acceptable, though “ajuste fino” is more common. The translation of “context window” as “marco de contexto” is less idiomatic, which slightly reduces consistency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the original intent and adapted cultural references (e.g., “aprobar por librillo” for cramming). The overall tone matches the podcast style. A few literal renderings could be smoother, but the adaptation is effective for Spanish‑speaking audiences.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is present; no substantive content is omitted or added unnecessarily. The translation maintains the logical flow and includes all examples and explanations.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast dialogue accurately and keeps the technical explanations intact. While the overall comprehension is solid, occasional non‑idiomatic phrasing and inconsistent terminology prevent it from reaching native‑level fluency. Minor edits—especially around the expression of “context window” and some colloquial phrases—would raise the quality further. Nonetheless, it is a strong, complete translation suitable for the target audience.\nOverall score (sum of the five criteria): 82/100."
