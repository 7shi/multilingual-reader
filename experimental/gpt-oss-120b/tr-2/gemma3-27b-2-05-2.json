    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original script. Most sentences are easy to understand, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in a straightforward way. The occasional use of less common phrasing (e.g., “pre‑capacitación”) slightly hinders immediate comprehension for a lay audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, but there are a few literal renderings that feel awkward to a native speaker: “aprendizaje puntual”, “la IA no ha ‘olvidado’ humanamente”, and the redundant “Aprendizaje en Contexto (ICL), o aprendizaje dentro del contexto”. These do not break comprehension but affect the smoothness of the prose.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well handled. “Transfer learning” and “in‑context learning” are correctly translated. However, “pre‑training” is rendered as “pre‑capacitación”, which is not the usual term in Spanish (the standard is “pre‑entrenamiento” or “pre‑entrenamiento”). The English loanword “grounding” is left untranslated, while the French original used “ancrage”. A consistent Spanish term (e.g., “anclaje”) would be preferable. Overall the terminology is acceptable but not optimal.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation successfully conveys the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral and the examples (consultant, bicycle) work well in Spanish. The adaptation respects the target audience and maintains the explanatory spirit of the original.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is omitted, and the dialogue structure is preserved. Minor stylistic differences do not affect the conveyed content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and captures the educational tone of the original podcast. It is mostly clear and complete, with only a few lexical choices that feel less natural or slightly off‑standard for Spanish technical discourse. Improving the consistency of key technical terms would raise the overall quality.\nOverall, the work demonstrates good competence in both languages, with room for refinement in fluency and terminology.\nScore (average of criteria): 17/20.\n\n**Overall Score**: 17"
