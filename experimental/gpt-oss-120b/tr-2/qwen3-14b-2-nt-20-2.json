    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the podcast‑style dialogue is maintained. However, there are a few typographical and grammatical slips (e.g., *«ajuste fina»* instead of *«ajuste fino»*), and some expressions could be smoother. These minor issues prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part and uses appropriate vocabulary. Some phrasing feels slightly awkward (e.g., *«fundamentación (grounding)»* is not the usual term; *«anclaje»* would be more idiomatic). The occasional typo and a few literal translations slightly reduce fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto* are all appropriate. The choice of *«fundamentación»* for “grounding” is not standard, and *«ajuste fina»* is a typo, but the overall terminology is consistent and understandable.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral and the dialogue flows as a typical Spanish‑language tech podcast. Minor lexical choices could be refined, but the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is retained. No key ideas are omitted, and the logical progression of the conversation is preserved. The only issues are typographical rather than substantive.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the original content well. It is readable and mostly fluent, with correct technical terminology in most cases. Small typographical errors (e.g., *«ajuste fina»*) and a non‑standard translation of “grounding” are the main weaknesses. Overall, the work is high‑quality and would be readily understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17.2 / 20 (rounded to 17)."
