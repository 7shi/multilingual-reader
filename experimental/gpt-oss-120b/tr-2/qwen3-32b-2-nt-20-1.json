    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clearly presented. Sentences are mostly logical, but a few constructions feel heavy or slightly ambiguous (e.g., \"una nueva y más flexible aproximación está emergiendo\", \"hablar con usted\"). These minor hiccups do not block comprehension, so the text remains readable for the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly natural, but there are several awkward phrasing choices that a native speaker would likely re‑phrase: \"una nueva y más flexible aproximación\", \"el afinamiento\" (less common than \"ajuste fino\"), the use of the acronym AIC instead of the more widespread ICL, and occasional literal renderings that sound stilted. Vocabulary is appropriate, yet the flow is occasionally disrupted.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well handled: pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, memoria, etc. Consistency is maintained throughout the text. The only slight drawback is the translation of \"fine‑tuning\" as \"afinamiento\", which is understandable but not the most common term in Spanish technical literature (\"ajuste fino\"). Overall, terminology is accurate and appropriate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are neutral, and the examples (consultant, bike‑learning analogy) work well in Spanish. Minor stylistic improvements could be made (e.g., using \"consultor\" instead of \"consultor brillante\" in some places), but the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant omissions or distortions are observed. The only small deviation is the change of the abbreviation ICL to AIC, which does not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and retains the educational tone. While the content is complete and technical terminology is largely correct, the text suffers from occasional unnatural phrasing and less idiomatic word choices that slightly reduce fluency. A few adjustments—especially around less common terms like \"afinamiento\" and smoothing out cumbersome sentences—would bring the translation closer to native‑speaker quality.\nOverall score: 84/100."
