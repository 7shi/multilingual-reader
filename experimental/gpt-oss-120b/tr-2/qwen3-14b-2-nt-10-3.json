  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. Most sentences are clear, and complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. Minor issues such as leaving the French interjection “D’accord.” untranslated and occasional inconsistent hyphenation do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but a few awkward expressions remain. \"El ajuste fina\" is a typo (should be \"ajuste fino\"), \"El afinamiento\" is less common than \"ajuste fino\", and the French word \"D'accord\" is left unchanged. These errors make the text feel slightly mechanical in places.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is largely well‑handled: pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, grounding, etc. Consistency is mostly kept, though the fine‑tuning term is inconsistently rendered (\"ajuste fina\" vs \"El afinamiento\"). The decision to keep \"prompt\" in English is acceptable for a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the dialogue to Spanish‑speaking listeners, using appropriate idioms and sentence structures. Cultural references are preserved, and the tone remains conversational. The lone French interjection and a few literal translations slightly break the immersion, but the overall intent is conveyed accurately.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the original ideas, examples, and analogies are present. No substantive content is omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as in the source. Minor redundancies (e.g., repeating \"ventana de contexto\") are unchanged but do not affect completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor typographical errors and a few untranslated French fragments prevent it from being perfect, but the core concepts, terminology, and conversational tone are preserved. With a quick proofread to fix the \"ajuste fina\" typo and replace the remaining French word, the text would reach near‑native quality.\n\nOverall score (sum of the five criteria): 82/100."
