  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured, the dialogue format is preserved, and complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained clearly. A few minor phrasing choices (e.g., \"su memoria se borra\" instead of a more natural \"se vacía\") do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most of the text. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. There are a few slightly awkward constructions – such as \"La IA\" (the article is fine but \"la IA\" is more common) and \"use estas herramientas\" (prefer \"utilice\") – but overall the flow is smooth and native‑speaker‑like.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently. \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correct. The choice of \"afinamiento\" for \"fine‑tuning\" is acceptable, though \"ajuste fino\" would be more standard in Spanish technical literature. Overall terminology is accurate and well‑matched to the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references and idioms appropriately (e.g., \"como contratar a un consultor brillante\"). It maintains the original intent and tone of a podcast discussion. The only minor lapse is keeping the original French brand name \"Tech Éclair\" unchanged at the end, which may be intentional but could be adapted to \"Tecnología Flash\" for full localization.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as in the original. Redundancies are minimal and the translation stays concise while preserving meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, is readable and mostly fluent, and respects the original conversational style. Minor terminology and phrasing tweaks could bring it to perfection, but the current version is fully functional and informative for Spanish‑speaking listeners."
