  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the sentences are well‑structured. Complex ideas such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, y aprendizaje en contexto are explained clearly and the dialogue format is preserved, making it easy for a Spanish‑speaking listener to follow.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for native speakers. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. A few constructions are slightly formal for a podcast (e.g., “el propio modelo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus conversaciones”), but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje (grounding). When needed, brief explanations are kept, and the original French terms are kept in quotes for clarity. No mistranslations of key jargon are observed.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the target audience’s cultural and linguistic expectations. The use of Spanish‑style explanations and the avoidance of French‑specific idioms make the content feel native. A minor point is the occasional formal “usted” tone in a casual podcast, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is retained. No ideas are omitted, and the nuances (e.g., the distinction between memoria temporal y permanente, the “truco” of the Memory feature) are fully preserved. Redundancies are not introduced.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, reads smoothly, and adapts well to a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience. Minor stylistic choices (slightly formal register and a few punctuation nuances) prevent a perfect score, but they do not affect the overall comprehension or fidelity.\nOverall Score: 19/20"
