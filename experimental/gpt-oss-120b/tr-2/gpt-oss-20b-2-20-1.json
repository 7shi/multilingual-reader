  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow for most readers. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the dialogue format is preserved. A few minor awkward turns (e.g., “En lugar de eso,” and “es del bachotaje”) slightly hinder flow but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are some non‑idiomatic expressions such as “En lugar de eso, no enseñarías…” and “el aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje.” These would be phrased differently by native speakers. Overall, the text reads smoothly enough for a podcast script.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)* and *grounding* rendered as “anclaje”. The word *prompt* is left untranslated, which is acceptable for a tech‑savvy audience. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent and informal conversational tone are preserved. Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is needed. Small phrasing issues (e.g., “es del bachotaje”) could be clearer for Spanish‑speaking listeners, but the overall message is conveyed accurately.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No important idea is omitted, and the explanations remain intact. Redundancies are minimal and the content stays concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and captures the technical depth of the original podcast. It is readable and mostly fluent, with a few non‑idiomatic expressions that could be polished. Terminology is well‑chosen and consistent, and the full information is retained. Minor stylistic tweaks would raise the fluency score, but overall it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking tech audience.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16.8 ≈ 17/20."
