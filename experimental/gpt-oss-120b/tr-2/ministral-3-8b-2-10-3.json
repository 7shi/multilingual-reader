  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow; sentences are logical and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor issues such as occasional long sentences do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker. Most phrasing is smooth, though a few expressions (e.g., “¡Exactamente!” repeated, “el proceso llamado preentrenamiento”) feel slightly stilted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, grounding, etc. The choices match the expected terminology in Spanish‑speaking AI circles.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts well to a Spanish‑language audience, using appropriate cultural references and keeping the tone informal yet professional. The change of the podcast name to “Luz Tech” is a sensible localization.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present. No substantive content is omitted, and the added explanations are faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the original message accurately, uses correct technical vocabulary, and is largely natural and readable. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but the text is fully functional for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.4 ≈ 18/20."
