  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original dialogue structure. Most sentences convey the ideas clearly, but occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., “Usted lo ha entendido todo”, mixed formal‑informal pronouns) and the use of less‑common expressions like “entrenamiento previo” instead of the usual “pre‑entrenamiento” slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mixes registers (formal “Usted” with informal “tú”), includes unnecessary meta‑comments (“La mejora en la traducción…”) and occasional literal constructions that sound stiff. While a native reader can follow the conversation, the flow is disrupted by these unnatural elements.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely correct: “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “ventana de contexto”, “anclaje”. However, “ajuste fino” is rendered as “perfeccionamiento”, which is less standard, and the term “entrenamiento previo” is a bit uncommon. Overall the terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast, but the inconsistent register and insertion of translator notes (“La mejora en la traducción…”) reduce cultural and contextual fit. The core message is kept, yet the adaptation could be smoother.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present; no major ideas are omitted. The only issue is the addition of explanatory side‑notes that are not in the source, which adds noise but does not remove content.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning effectively, and the technical terms are mostly well‑handled. Nevertheless, the mixture of formal/informal pronouns, occasional unnatural phrasing, and the presence of translator‑side commentary detract from the naturalness and polish expected in a podcast script. A more consistent register and removal of meta‑comments would raise the quality considerably.\nOverall score: 71/100.\nRecommendations: use standard terms like “pre‑entrenamiento” and “ajuste fino”, keep a consistent informal tone, and eliminate non‑original explanatory notes to improve fluency and readability."
