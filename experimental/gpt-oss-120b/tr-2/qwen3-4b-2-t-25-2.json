    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the dialogue flows logically. Most sentences are easy to follow and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert reader can grasp. Minor hiccups such as “bienvenido en” instead of “bienvenido a” and a few redundant parentheses slightly affect smoothness, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several awkward or unidiomatic expressions: “Hola y bienvenido en…”, “aplastar en la víspera” for “bachotage”, “antiestación” (a non‑existent word) and duplicated “(anclaje)”. These reduce the natural feel of the translation for native speakers. Grammar is otherwise correct, but the choice of words sometimes sounds forced.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered (preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, prompt). The translator keeps English loanwords where appropriate. The main flaw is the mistranslation of “cheat‑sheet” as “antiestación”, which could confuse readers. Overall terminology handling is solid.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural adaptation is mostly adequate, but some phrases sound literal (“Hola y bienvenido en…”, “¡Una analogía perfecta !”) and the odd term “antiestación” does not convey the intended meaning to Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present; no significant ideas are omitted. The translation does not add unnecessary material, and the structure mirrors the original script. Minor redundancy (e.g., “(anclaje)”) does not affect completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and keeps the conversational structure of the podcast. Readability and completeness are strong points. Fluency and cultural adaptation suffer from a few literal renderings and an odd invented word, which make the text feel slightly unnatural for native Spanish speakers. Terminology is largely well‑handled, with only a single notable misstep.\nOverall the work is good, but polishing the awkward phrases and fixing the mistranslated term would bring it to a higher quality level.\nScore out of 20: 15\n\n**Final rating:** 15/20"
