  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the explanations of complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are clear. Minor issues such as inconsistent hyphenation (preentrenamiento vs pre‑entrenamiento) and the occasional long sentence slightly affect flow, but the overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few expressions feel a bit literal or mixed with English (“fine‑tuning”, “prompt”, “Tech Éclair”). Phrases like \"se ha vaciado su área de trabajo temporal\" are correct but sound slightly stiff. Overall, a native speaker would understand it without effort, though a few tweaks would improve smoothness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is well‑handled: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, anclaje, etc., are correctly rendered. The occasional retention of English terms (fine‑tuning, prompt) is acceptable in a technical context but reduces consistency. Otherwise, term usage is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original intent well to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using appropriate analogies (consultor brillante, bachotaje). Cultural references are preserved without awkwardness. The only slight mismatch is the unchanged podcast name \"Tech Éclair\" at the end, which could be left as‑is or translated, but it does not hinder understanding.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is retained. No major ideas are omitted, and the logical progression of the discussion is preserved. Minor stylistic repetitions are present, but they do not affect the completeness of the content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical discussion accurately. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency could benefit from smoothing a few literal renderings and reducing the mix of English terms. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a technical podcast audience, with only minor refinements needed for full naturalness and consistency.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16.4 → rounded to 16/20.\n\nScore: 16/20"
