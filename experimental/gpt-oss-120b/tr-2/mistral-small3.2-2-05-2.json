    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the sentences are easy to follow. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained clearly with suitable analogies. Minor inconsistencies in verb forms (e.g., “abres” vs. “abre”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part and uses appropriate, contemporary vocabulary. A few phrases feel slightly stiff (e.g., “partes de un contexto vacío” instead of “empiezas con un contexto vacío”) and the switch from “Tech Éclair” to “Tecnología Rápida” is a stylistic choice that slightly reduces brand fidelity. Overall, native speakers would find it smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: pre‑training → “preentrenamiento”, fine‑tuning → “ajuste fino”, transfer learning → “aprendizaje por transferencia”, ICL → “aprendizaje en contexto”, grounding → “anclaje”. Where English terms are kept (e.g., “prompt”) a clear Spanish equivalent is provided. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the dialogue to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using idiomatic expressions and culturally neutral references. The only noteworthy deviation is the renaming of the podcast from “Tech Éclair” to “Tecnología Rápida”, which slightly changes the original branding but does not affect the informational content.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French original is retained. No major ideas are omitted, and the logical progression of the conversation is preserved. The only minor loss is the original podcast title, which was altered.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality: it conveys the technical content accurately, reads clearly, and sounds natural for Spanish speakers. Minor issues such as occasional verb‑form inconsistency, a slightly awkward phrasing, and the change of the podcast’s name prevent a perfect score but do not detract significantly from the overall effectiveness.\nOverall rating: 18/20.\n\nStrengths: precise terminology, clear explanations, good readability.\nAreas for improvement: maintain original proper nouns (e.g., \"Tech Éclair\"), smooth out a few stiff expressions, ensure consistent verb forms.\n\nOverall, the translation would serve Spanish‑language listeners well and effectively communicates the original podcast’s message."
