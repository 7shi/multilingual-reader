  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but several sentences are overly long and include parenthetical remarks that were not in the original, which can interrupt the flow. Some phrasing is clunky (e.g., “Usted ha entendido todo.”) and the added explanatory clause about “procesos complejos” adds confusion. Overall a reader can follow the ideas, but the structure could be smoother.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are many literal translations and formal constructions that sound unnatural in spoken Spanish. Examples include the use of “Usted” for a podcast dialogue, the word “ancoraje” for grounding, and phrasing such as “permite que el modelo pueda aprender”. These issues reduce the naturalness, even though most vocabulary is correct.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly (pre‑entrenamiento, ventana de contexto, ICL). However, \"fine‑tuning\" is rendered as \"ajuste\" instead of the more precise \"ajuste fino\" or kept in English, and \"grounding\" becomes \"ancoraje\", which is not the standard term. The translation also adds extra explanations that were not present in the source.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation introduces editorial comments (e.g., “aunque es importante aclarar…”) and changes the register from informal podcast speech to a more formal style. While the core intent is preserved, these shifts alter the original tone and may feel less engaging for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present, and no critical information is omitted. The translation does add some supplementary remarks that are not in the source, which can be seen as noise rather than necessary clarification.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the overall message of the podcast and retains the technical content, but it suffers from a lack of natural flow, occasional misuse of technical terminology, and the inclusion of unnecessary editorial commentary. A more faithful, colloquial rendering would improve readability and fluency, especially for a podcast audience.\n\nOverall score (sum of the five criteria): 67/100."
