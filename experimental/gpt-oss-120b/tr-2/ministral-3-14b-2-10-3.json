  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to follow. Sentences are short and the flow mirrors the original dialogue. Minor hiccups, such as the stray line \"Camille: ventanas de discusión\" and occasional redundant parentheses, slightly disrupt comprehension, but the core ideas remain clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most of the text. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic (e.g., \"analizamos\", \"desvelar\", \"consultor brillante\"). A few phrasing choices feel a bit forced (e.g., \"memoria temporal\" vs. \"memoria de uso único\", the space before question marks, and the mixed use of English acronyms). Overall, it reads smoothly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"memoria de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (AEC)\". The translation of \"grounding\" as \"anclaje a datos\" is clear. Some inconsistency appears with acronyms (ICL vs. AEC) and occasional retention of English words, but the terminology remains accurate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The podcast tone is preserved, and cultural references are adapted (e.g., using Spanish‑style interjections). The translator offers alternative podcast titles, which could confuse listeners but shows awareness of target‑audience preferences. Overall, the intent and register are maintained.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of \"memory\" features. No substantive information is lost; only minor redundancies appear due to parenthetical notes.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is strong, conveying the technical content in an accessible, conversational Spanish style. Minor editorial slips (stray text, inconsistent acronym usage, and optional title variants) prevent a perfect score, but the overall quality is high and suitable for a podcast audience.\n\n**Total score:** 86/100.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1. Remove stray lines like \"Camille: ventanas de discusión\".\n2. Choose a single, consistent acronym for In‑Context Learning (ICL or AEC) and stick with it.\n3. Eliminate unnecessary parenthetical alternatives to keep the script tight.\n4. Adjust punctuation to Spanish norms (no space before \"?\", \"!\", etc.).\nThese tweaks would raise fluency and readability to near‑perfect levels."
