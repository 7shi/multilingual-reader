  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor issues such as the duplicated \"Camille:\" label and occasional long sentences do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, using appropriate idiomatic Spanish. A few phrasing choices feel slightly stiff (e.g., \"el preentrenamiento (o pre‑entrenamiento)\" and the repeated speaker label), but overall the flow is smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\". The occasional English term is retained with a clear parenthetical explanation, maintaining consistency.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., using \"¡Hola y bienvenidos...\" instead of a literal greeting). Small formatting glitches (duplicate labels) slightly affect polish, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is lost; only superficial formatting repetitions appear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the original podcast dialogue accurately and clearly. It uses suitable technical vocabulary and maintains the conversational tone, making the material accessible to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor typographic repetitions and a few slightly awkward phrasings prevent a perfect score, but the overall quality is high and the content is complete.\n\nStrengths: precise terminology, clear explanations, faithful rendering of the original ideas.\nAreas for improvement: clean up duplicated speaker tags and smooth out a couple of stiff expressions.\n\nOverall, the translation is very good and would be readily understood by the target audience.\n\nFinal aggregate score (sum of the five criteria): 88/100."
