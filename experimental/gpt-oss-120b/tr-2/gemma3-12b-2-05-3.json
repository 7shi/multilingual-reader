  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Most sentences convey the original meaning without ambiguity. A few passages feel slightly literal (e.g., “una IA totalmente nueva en la escuela”), but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, but there are occasional awkward constructions (“una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”, “conexión a la realidad” for grounding). These minor slips prevent a perfect native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"fine‑tuning\" → \"ajuste fino\", \"In‑Context Learning\" → \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"prompt\" is rendered as \"indicaciones\". The only notable issue is the translation of “grounding” as “conexión a la realidad”, which is not the usual term in Spanish AI literature (\"anclaje\" or keep the English).",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of the podcast script. It adapts the language for a Spanish‑speaking audience while keeping the explanatory style. Minor literal choices (e.g., “ventana de contexto”) are acceptable, but a slightly more idiomatic phrasing could improve cultural resonance.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All relevant information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the logical flow of the discussion is maintained. The translation even adds a clarifying parenthetical for \"prompt\".",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the technical content effectively. It is readable and mostly fluent, with only occasional literalness and a few non‑standard term choices. Technical terminology is well‑handled, and the complete information from the original is retained. Minor stylistic tweaks would bring the fluency closer to native‑speaker level, but the current version is already of high quality.\n\nFinal overall score (average of criteria): 16.6 → 17/20.\n\nScore out of 20 points: 17"
