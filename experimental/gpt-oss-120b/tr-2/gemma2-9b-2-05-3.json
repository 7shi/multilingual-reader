  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas, and the technical concepts are explained in a way most readers can understand. A few long sentences could be broken up for smoother reading, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, but there are occasional awkward phrasings (e.g., \"El aprendizaje contextual es como estudiar para un examen\" instead of a more idiomatic \"El aprendizaje en contexto se parece a estudiar para un examen\"). Minor grammatical quirks do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, anclaje). However, the placeholder \"ICL [brief explanation of ICL]\" is left untranslated, and the abbreviation is not explained, which detracts from completeness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts the greeting and style to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Small inconsistencies such as alternating \"aprendizaje contextual\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" slightly reduce the seamlessness, but the overall cultural adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present. The only notable loss is the missing explanation for ICL, which was present in the original script. No other substantive information is omitted.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the podcast’s content accurately. Readability and contextual adaptation are strong, while fluency and terminology are very good with minor issues. The main drawback is the unfinished placeholder for the ICL explanation, which prevents a perfect score. Overall, the work demonstrates a high level of competence and would be well‑understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience."
