  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and conveys the concepts clearly. Sentence structures are logical, and the dialogue format is preserved. Minor issues such as the use of \"pre‑entrenado\" instead of the more natural noun \"preentrenamiento\" and occasional awkward phrasing slightly affect smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few unnatural expressions (e.g., \"el pre‑entrenado\", \"el afianzamiento\" for fine‑tuning) and some literal renderings that feel stiff. Overall, a native speaker would understand it without effort, yet a few tweaks would make it flow better.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely kept consistent (ICL, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje por transferencia). However, the term for fine‑tuning is inconsistently rendered as \"afinamiento\" and later as \"afianzamiento\", which is not a standard translation. The word \"grounding\" is left in English inside parentheses, which could have been fully translated. These inconsistencies lower the score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast’s branding (\"Tecnología Flash\"), and the examples are culturally neutral, making the content appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor lexical choices could be refined, but the intent and tone of the original are well preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present; no substantive content is omitted. The translation includes the same examples, analogies, and explanations. Slight redundancies are avoided, and the core message remains intact.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is solid and conveys the original podcast script accurately. It is readable and mostly fluent, with only a few lexical and terminological inconsistencies that prevent it from being perfect. With minor adjustments—especially standardizing the translation of \"fine‑tuning\" and fully translating \"grounding\"—the text would reach a native‑level quality. The translation succeeds in preserving the educational tone and technical depth while being accessible to Spanish‑speaking listeners."
