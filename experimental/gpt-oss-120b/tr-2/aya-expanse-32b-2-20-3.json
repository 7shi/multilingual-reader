  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable; sentences flow logically and the concepts are explained in a way that a Spanish‑speaking audience can follow. A few awkward questions (e.g., “¿Es decir, quieres que te explique el concepto con más detalle?”) slightly disrupt the smoothness, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation sounds natural, but there are several clunky or overly literal constructions (“Este enfoque revolucionario se conoce como aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”, “¿Es decir, quieres que te explique el concepto con más detalle?”). These moments make the text feel less like native Spanish and more like a literal rendering.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana contextual, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), grounding → anclaje, etc. The translator kept the jargon appropriate for a tech‑savvy audience and added parenthetical explanations where helpful.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original podcast are preserved. The translation adapts the analogies (consultor vs consultant, bicicleta vs bike) appropriately for Spanish speakers. Minor cultural nuances (e.g., “consultor temporal”) are acceptable, though the phrasing could be slightly polished.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is retained. No key points are omitted, and the added clarifying question does not alter the meaning. The translation is comprehensive while staying faithful to the source.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the original content well. Technical terminology is handled correctly, and the message is complete. Fluency suffers from a few literal translations and awkward questions, which prevent it from feeling completely native, but readability remains high. Minor stylistic edits would bring the text to a near‑native level.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 17.4 → rounded to 17/20.\nScore: 17"
