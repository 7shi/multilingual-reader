  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the logical flow of the original. However, there are several syntactic glitches (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en”, “Las conocimientos”, mixed use of ‘tú’ and ‘usted’) that can momentarily confuse readers. The concepts are explained, but occasional awkward phrasing reduces smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural constructions and grammatical errors: “Usted ha entendido todo”, “cuando usted afinan un modelo”, “el aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotage”. The register shifts between formal and informal, which is inconsistent for a podcast style. Vocabulary is mostly correct but the flow feels stilted.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as preentrenamiento, afinación, transferencia de aprendizaje, ventana de contexto, ICL are correctly rendered. Some terms are left in French or English without explanation (e.g., “grounding”, “bachotage”), and a few translations are slightly off (“aprendizaje por transferencia” is good, but “aprendizaje en contexto” could be clarified). Overall terminology is adequate but not fully polished.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a conversational podcast, but the mixed formal‑informal pronouns and occasional literal translations (“consultor brillante”, “una antisèche”) make it feel less natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural adaptation is minimal but acceptable.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas and details from the French script are present; no significant omissions or additions are detected. Minor typographical errors do not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the full content of the original podcast and conveys the technical ideas accurately. Nevertheless, it suffers from noticeable grammatical mistakes, inconsistent register, and a few untranslated or poorly adapted terms. A thorough proofreading and a more consistent use of either formal or informal address would greatly improve readability and naturalness, raising the overall quality to a near‑native level.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14/20."
