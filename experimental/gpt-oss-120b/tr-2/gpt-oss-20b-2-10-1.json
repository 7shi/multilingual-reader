  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the logical flow of the podcast dialogue is preserved. Minor hiccups (e.g., occasional long sentences) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, but a few literal renderings and inconsistent pronoun use (mix of \"usted\" and \"tú\") make some passages feel slightly awkward. Vocabulary is appropriate, yet expressions like \"A ver:\" or the redundant \"aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\" feel a bit forced.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately translated and consistently applied: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, anclaje/enraizamiento, memoria. Only the choice \"enraizamiento\" for \"grounding\" is less common, but the meaning is clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original intent well for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral and the podcast tone is retained. The main drawback is the inconsistent use of formal vs. informal address, which can slightly break the listener’s immersion.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as the source. Redundancy is minimal.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is a strong, faithful rendering of the original podcast script. It conveys the technical concepts clearly and retains the conversational style, though minor stylistic issues (inconsistent pronouns, occasional literal phrasing) prevent it from being perfectly natural. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI topics.\n\n**Strengths**: clear readability, accurate terminology, complete information transfer.\n**Areas for improvement**: smoother phrasing in a few spots and consistent use of either formal or informal second‑person pronouns throughout.\n\n**Overall score (average of criteria)**: 17.4 / 20."
