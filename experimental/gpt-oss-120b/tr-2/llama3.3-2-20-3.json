  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and the dialogue flows logically. Most sentences are easy to understand, and the technical concepts are explained in accessible language. Minor issues such as the odd “¿Es decir? or ¿Qué quieres decir?” insertion and a few overly long sentences slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, but there are several awkward phrasings: the mixed English/Spanish phrase “si keeping the original name is desired”, the parenthetical “or ¿Qué quieres decir?” and occasional literal translations (e.g., keeping “prompt” in English). These reduce the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well handled: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, anclaje (grounding), memoria, etc. Consistency is good, and abbreviations are preserved. The only minor point is keeping the English word “prompt”, but it does not cause misunderstanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the informal podcast tone and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., noting the possible use of the original name). The occasional unnatural insertion mentioned above slightly weakens the adaptation, but overall the intent and purpose are faithfully conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French script is present. No significant content is omitted, and the added clarification about the podcast name does not alter meaning. The translation is complete and concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original content accurately and maintains a clear, informative tone suitable for a tech‑focused podcast. While the terminology is spot‑on and the information complete, fluency suffers from a few literal and mixed‑language constructions that make the text feel less natural to native Spanish speakers. Minor edits could bring the readability and fluency up to a higher level, but the core message is well preserved.\n\nOverall score: 83/100."
