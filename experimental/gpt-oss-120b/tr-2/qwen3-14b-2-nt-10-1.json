  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the conversational tone and explains complex AI concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto) in clear, accessible language. Sentence structures are generally short and logical, making the content easy to follow for a broad audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for native Spanish speakers. Most idiomatic expressions are well chosen (\"como contratar a un consultor brillante\", \"estudiar de última hora\"). A few minor awkwardnesses appear, such as \"el ajuste fina\" (should be \"ajuste fino\") and occasional Anglicisms left untranslated (\"prompt\"), but they do not significantly impede flow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\". When a French term is kept (e.g., \"grounding\"), a Spanish explanation follows, which helps comprehension. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., using \"examen\" instead of \"examen\" in French). The intent and pedagogical purpose of the podcast are preserved. Small lapses like retaining the French \"D'accord\" could have been replaced with \"De acuerdo\", but overall the adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the original script are present: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary nature of prompt‑based knowledge, and the mechanics behind \"memoria\" features. No significant information is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains engaging, and is largely fluent and readable. Minor lexical choices (e.g., \"ajuste fina\", retained French interjections) prevent a perfect score, but they are easily correctable. The work would serve well for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience interested in AI fundamentals.\n\nStrengths: clear explanations, consistent terminology, faithful preservation of the original structure.\nAreas for improvement: polish a few awkward phrases and replace leftover French words with their Spanish equivalents.\n\nThe translation is ready for publication with only minimal copy‑editing needed.\n\nOverall Score (out of 20): 17.5 → 18"
