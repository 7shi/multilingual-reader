    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear, step‑by‑step manner. Even the more abstract analogies (e.g., studying for an exam vs. mastering a subject) are easy to follow for a native speaker.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, with appropriate verb tenses and idiomatic phrasing. Minor hiccups such as “afinamiento” instead of the more common “ajuste fino” and the use of “indicación” for “prompt” slightly reduce the native feel.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, anclaje, etc. The translator kept consistency and provided understandable Spanish equivalents.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational tone of a podcast is preserved and cultural references are appropriate. The only notable deviation is the change of the podcast title from \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Tecnología Rápida\", which slightly alters the brand identity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the original information is retained; no substantive content is omitted. The small title change does not affect the factual content of the discussion.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality: it conveys the original message clearly, uses appropriate technical language, and reads smoothly for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor lexical choices and the alteration of the podcast name prevent it from being perfect, but the core content and intent are fully preserved.\nOverall rating: 90/100.\n\nStrengths: excellent fidelity, clear explanations, consistent terminology.\nWeaknesses: occasional non‑idiomatic word choices and a brand‑name change that could confuse listeners familiar with the original title.\n\nRecommendation: keep the original podcast name in the target language (or provide a footnote) and replace less common terms like \"afinamiento\" with \"ajuste fino\" for greater naturalness.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 90."
