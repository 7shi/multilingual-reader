  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are easy to follow. Sentences are a bit long in places and there is some repetition (e.g., “Comienza antes de que la IA comience…”), but the overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, but there are occasional awkward constructions (e.g., “el aprendizaje por transferencia es la clave. Veamos”, mixed use of “afinamiento” and “ajuste fino”, and minor grammatical slips). These do not impede understanding but reduce native‑speaker smoothness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and “ajuste fino” are correctly rendered. The only drawback is the inconsistent use of “afinamiento” vs. “ajuste fino”, which could confuse readers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the original podcast tone, added inclusive gender forms (“bienvenidos/as”), and adapted cultural references appropriately. The intent and humor of the dialogue are maintained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present. Some added explanatory clauses (e.g., a brief definition of pre‑entrenamiento) enrich the text without altering meaning. No relevant information is lost.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid overall. It conveys the technical content clearly, keeps the conversational style of the podcast, and is largely faithful to the source. Minor issues with fluency and term consistency prevent it from being perfect, but the text is readily understandable for Spanish‑speaking audiences interested in AI concepts.\nOverall score: 17/20."
