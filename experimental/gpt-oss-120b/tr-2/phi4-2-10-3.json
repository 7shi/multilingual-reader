  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logical and the explanations of complex concepts are clear. A few minor awkward phrasings (e.g., “Véase, por ejemplo:” and “mandamos una IA… a la escuela”) slightly affect flow, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. Small stylistic glitches (some literal translations from French) are present, but overall the language sounds smooth and idiomatic.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “preentrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”, and “anclaje (grounding)” are correctly rendered and used consistently throughout. No important term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural references are adapted correctly for a Spanish‑speaking audience, and the conversational style is maintained. Minor phrasing choices could be more idiomatic, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No key ideas are omitted, and the content remains concise while keeping the original nuance. The supplemental explanations (e.g., for “grounding”) are faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, uses appropriate terminology, and maintains the conversational tone of the podcast. Minor stylistic and phrasing issues prevent a perfect score, but they do not impact understanding. Overall, it is a strong, professional translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18.4 → rounded to 18/20."
