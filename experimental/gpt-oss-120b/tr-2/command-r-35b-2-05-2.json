  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the technical ideas are explained clearly. A few gender errors (using “el IA” instead of “la IA”) and occasional redundancy slightly affect smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly sounds natural, but the repeated misuse of the gender for “IA”, some clunky constructions (e.g., “el proceso de pre‑entrenamiento es el primer paso en la evolución…”) and occasional literal phrasing make it feel a bit awkward for native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, etc. The terminology is consistent throughout, with only minor issues such as the gender of “IA”.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the podcast tone well for a Spanish‑speaking audience, using appropriate equivalents like “Destello Tecnológico” and “Relámpago Tecnológico”. Cultural references are preserved and the style remains engaging, though a few expressions could be smoother.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No significant information is lost.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the substance and educational intent of the original podcast very well. It conveys the technical concepts accurately and maintains the conversational tone. The main shortcomings are grammatical gender errors for “IA” and occasional phrasing that feels slightly literal, which prevent the text from reaching full native‑speaker fluency. Addressing these issues would bring the translation to a higher level of polish.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 17/20."
