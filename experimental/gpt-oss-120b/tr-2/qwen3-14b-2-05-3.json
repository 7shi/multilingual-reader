  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to follow. Sentences are mostly short and the logical flow mirrors the original. Minor typographical errors (e.g., \"crammar\", missing opening exclamation marks) do not hinder comprehension, but they slightly reduce smoothness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound literal or awkward: \"se le envía una IA\", \"el modelo mismo no aprende ni evoluciona\", and the mixture of English terms (fine‑tuning, finetuning) with Spanish. The typo \"crammar\" and inconsistent punctuation also break the natural rhythm. A native speaker would rephrase a few passages.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical vocabulary is mostly preserved (preentrenamiento, ventana de contexto, ICL). However, the translation inconsistently treats \"fine‑tuning\" – sometimes kept in English, sometimes rendered as \"ajuste fino\" – and leaves English acronyms without Spanish equivalents. The handling is acceptable but not fully consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent and pedagogical tone are retained. Metaphors such as \"consultor brillante\" and \"aprender a montar en bicicleta\" work well in Spanish. Small issues (e.g., literal translation of \"bachotage\" as \"estudiar de último momento\") are understandable but could be smoother.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present. No substantial content is omitted, and the translation does not add irrelevant material. The only loss is minor nuance due to the few typographical errors.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and keeps the educational spirit of the podcast. Readability and completeness are strong, but fluency suffers from literal renderings, occasional typos, and inconsistent handling of English technical terms. A revision to smooth out awkward phrasing and standardise terminology would raise the overall quality.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 16.4 ≈ 16/20."
