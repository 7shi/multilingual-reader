  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured, the dialogue format is preserved and complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are explained clearly. The only minor issue is the use of the vosotros form, which may feel regional, but it does not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but a few phrases feel literal (“Ahora vamos a hablar del pre‑entrenamiento”, “Inserta automáticamente estos extractos en el *prompt*, de forma automática”). The redundancy of “automáticamente” and occasional anglicisms slightly reduce fluency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding, prompt, etc. The term *grounding* is left in English but explained in parentheses, which is acceptable for a technical audience. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original podcast tone and adapts expressions appropriately for Spanish‑speaking listeners. The only cultural nuance is the use of vosotros, which is typical of European Spanish but may feel foreign to Latin‑American audiences; nevertheless the intent and register are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is present. No ideas are omitted, and the logical flow is retained. Minor redundancy does not affect completeness.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality: it conveys the technical content accurately, remains readable and mostly natural, and preserves the conversational style of the podcast. Minor stylistic tweaks (avoid redundant adverbs, consider regional pronouns, translate ‘prompt’) would push the fluency a bit higher, but the overall result is excellent for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17.6 ≈ 18/20."
