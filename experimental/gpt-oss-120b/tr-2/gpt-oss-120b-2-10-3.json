  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the dialogue format is preserved, allowing the reader to understand the flow of the discussion. A few sentences are long, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds mostly natural, but there are several small issues: the use of French guillemets (« »), the uncommon word «afinamiento» instead of the more usual «ajuste fino», occasional spacing errors around punctuation, and a few literal constructions that feel a bit stiff. These quirks prevent a perfect native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly rendered (e.g., preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL). However, some choices are not the most common in Spanish technical literature («afinamiento» for fine‑tuning, «anclaje» for grounding) and the hyphenated form «pre‑entrenamiento» is inconsistent. Overall the terminology is understandable but not fully optimal.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent, tone, and educational purpose. The cultural adaptation is adequate, but the lingering French quotation marks and a few literal translations (e.g., «memoria a corto plazo de la IA, o «ventana de contexto»») slightly reduce the natural fit for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present. No significant content has been omitted or altered, and the technical explanations remain intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does an excellent job of preserving the original content and making the technical discussion accessible to Spanish readers. Readability and completeness are strong points. Fluency and terminology could be improved by using more idiomatic Spanish technical vocabulary and by removing French‑style punctuation. Minor stylistic tweaks would bring the text to a native‑speaker level of naturalness.\nOverall score: 17/20 (85 %)."
