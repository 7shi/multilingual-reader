    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the original dialogue structure, so a reader can follow the discussion. However, there are several awkward sentences (e.g., “Tal es la realidad del aprendizaje de idiomas asistido por computadora”) and redundant repetitions (\"pre‑entrenamiento (pre‑entrenamiento)\") that slightly hinder smooth reading. Overall comprehension is possible but not optimal.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many literal constructions and a few typographical errors (\"ancraje\" instead of \"anclaje\"). Some phrasing sounds unnatural for native speakers, and the mistranslation of ICL as \"aprendizaje de idiomas asistido por computadora\" breaks the flow. While the dialogue is coherent, the language does not feel fully natural.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are not consistently handled. \"In‑Context Learning\" (ICL) is incorrectly rendered, \"grounding\" is misspelled, and the original podcast name \"Tech Éclair\" is partially changed to \"Tech Iluminación\" then left in French at the end, causing inconsistency. The translation also omits the French acronym \"ICL\" in several places, reducing technical clarity.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the general tone to Spanish, but some cultural/linguistic adjustments are missing or erroneous (e.g., using \"ancraje\" and the wrong ICL description). The intent of the original is mostly preserved, yet the inaccurate rendering of core concepts weakens the adaptation.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original information is present, but the mis‑translation of ICL and occasional omission of explanatory nuances (such as the precise meaning of \"affinage\" versus \"fine‑tuning\") lead to minor loss of detail. No major sections are omitted, but accuracy suffers.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the overall storyline of the podcast and is readable for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but it suffers from several critical inaccuracies—most notably the wrong rendering of In‑Context Learning, inconsistent terminology, and occasional unnatural phrasing. These issues reduce the technical precision and naturalness of the text. A revision focusing on correct technical terms, eliminating redundant phrasing, and polishing the style would markedly improve the quality."
