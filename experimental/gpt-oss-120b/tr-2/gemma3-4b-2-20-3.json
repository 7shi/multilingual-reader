  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely understandable and follows the structure of the original script. Most sentences convey the intended meaning, and the technical concepts are explained. However, stray punctuation marks (e.g., ”}**, “}”), occasional missing commas, and a few awkward phrasings interrupt the flow and force the reader to re‑read sections.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several non‑native constructions and grammatical slips: gender disagreement (“Las conocimientos”), unnecessary repetition of “IA”, unnatural expressions like “Para que la tenga en cuenta”, and the presence of stray symbols that break the natural rhythm. These issues make the text feel less smooth than a native‑written script.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered – “pre‑entrenamiento” → “entrenamiento previo”, “fine‑tuning” → “ajuste fino”, “In‑Context Learning (ICL)”, “grounding” → “anclaje”. The translation keeps the English acronyms and uses appropriate Spanish equivalents. Minor problems appear with the plural “informaciones” instead of “información”, but overall terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original podcast are preserved, and cultural references are suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Some small shifts (e.g., “Es lógico” → “Es así, ¿verdad?”) slightly change nuance, but the overall message remains intact. The translation could have smoothed some sentences to better fit Spanish podcast style.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French source is present; no major ideas are omitted. The only loss is incidental, caused by typographic errors rather than content removal. The translation remains comprehensive and faithful to the source.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in delivering the technical content and the conversational feel of the podcast, but it is marred by typographical glitches, occasional grammatical mistakes, and a few unnatural phrasings. Cleaning up the stray symbols, correcting gender agreement, and polishing the flow would raise the quality substantially.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 15/20."
