    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand. Sentences convey the original ideas and the logical flow is preserved. Minor issues such as \"Hola y bienvenido en\" instead of \"Hola y bienvenidos a\" and occasional long sentences slightly affect smooth comprehension, but the overall message remains clear.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several unnatural constructions and inconsistencies in register. The translation alternates between \"tú\" and \"usted\", which breaks the conversational tone of a podcast. Phrases like \"Usted ha entendido todo\" and \"el afinado\" sound forced. Punctuation with guillemets and some verb choices (\"están comenzando a integrar\") are awkward. These issues prevent the text from sounding fully native.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly (preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje). However, \"fine‑tuning\" is translated as \"el afinado\", which is not the standard term in Spanish (\"ajuste fino\" or \"fine‑tuning\"). This could confuse readers familiar with the field. Consistency is good otherwise, but the non‑standard term lowers the score.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original podcast style and the analogy of consultants, students, etc., which works well for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The mixed use of formal and informal pronouns slightly undermines the consistency of the voice. Apart from that, cultural references are appropriate and the intent of the original is well conveyed.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is omitted, and the examples (English‑French transfer, memory feature) are retained. The translation is faithful to the source content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the substance and educational tone of the original podcast, but it suffers from several fluency and terminology issues. The inconsistent use of formal/informal address and the non‑standard rendering of \"fine‑tuning\" are the main drawbacks. Despite these problems, the text is comprehensible and complete, making it a decent but improvable translation.\n\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 76/100."
