  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the flow of ideas mirrors the original French. Sentences are not overly long and concepts are explained in plain language. A few awkward phrasings (e.g., “¿Es decir, quieres que te explique el concepto con más detalle?”) slightly disrupt comprehension, but they do not prevent understanding.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several literal renderings betray the source language (“ventana contextual” instead of the more idiomatic “ventana de contexto”, “memoria desechable”, etc.). Some repetitions and overly formal constructions make the text feel a bit stilted for a spoken‑podcast style.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly identified and consistently used: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje, etc. The only minor issue is the choice of “anclaje” for grounding, which is acceptable but less common than “acople” or “fundamentación”. Overall terminology handling is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and maintains the explanatory tone. However, occasional additions (the question about explaining the concept) and the lack of some idiomatic adjustments for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience reduce the cultural fit slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the added clarifications do not alter the factual content. Redundancy is minimal.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of transferring the technical discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning into Spanish. It is largely complete and uses appropriate terminology. The main weaknesses lie in occasional literal phrasing and a few unnatural constructions that affect fluency and readability. With minor stylistic edits, the text would read as a natural, engaging podcast script for Spanish listeners.\nOverall score (out of 100): 84/100.\n\nBreak‑down:\n- Readability: 16/20\n- Fluency: 15/20\n- Terminology: 18/20\n- Contextual adaptation: 16/20\n- Information completeness: 19/20\n- Total: 84/100"
