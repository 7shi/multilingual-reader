  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version flows logically and the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are clear. Sentences are not overly long, and the analogies (e.g., graduate, consultant, bicycle) are kept, making the content easy for a non‑specialist audience to follow.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation reads naturally. Most idiomatic expressions are well chosen (\"levantar el velo\", \"caja negra\", \"consultor brillante\"). A few minor awkwardnesses appear, such as \"una cantidad mucho menor de texto en francés\" (could be \"una cantidad mucho menor de texto en francés\") and \"una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\" (slightly wordy), but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento (fine‑tuning)\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". The parenthetical English abbreviations are kept, which is appropriate for a tech‑savvy audience. No major mistranslations were found.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references suitably for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Phrases like \"como contratar a un consultor brillante\" work well. The occasional French‑style phrasing (“una forma ingeniosa…”) could be slightly more idiomatic, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information was omitted, and the added clarifications (e.g., “el modelo mismo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de tus discusiones”) reinforce understanding without adding redundancy.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content clearly, uses natural Spanish, handles terminology consistently, and preserves the podcast’s conversational tone. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but they do not detract from the overall effectiveness.\n\nStrengths: clear explanations, consistent technical vocabulary, faithful conveyance of the original message.\nAreas for improvement: smooth out a few slightly clunky phrases and consider shorter alternatives for overly long clauses.\nOverall, the translation would be easily understood and appreciated by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nScore (average of criteria): 87/100."
