  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are easy to follow. Sentences are generally clear, and complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can understand. A few minor punctuation quirks (e.g., missing commas) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are occasional literal renderings that feel slightly awkward to a native speaker. Examples include “es como bachotar” (the verb *bachotar* is rarely used in Spanish) and the retention of the English word “grounding” in parentheses. These minor issues prevent a perfect fluency score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled very well. Key terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"memoria a corto plazo\" are correctly translated and used consistently. The occasional bilingual bracket (e.g., \"anclaje (grounding)\") is acceptable for a podcast that may keep the original English term for clarity.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of the podcast, adapting cultural references appropriately (e.g., \"consultor brillante\"). Some idiomatic expressions could be refined for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but the overall adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No sentences are omitted, and the structure mirrors the source closely, ensuring that the listener receives the full content without loss.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality, conveying the technical content clearly and accurately. Readability and terminology are strong points. Fluency suffers from a few literal phrases and uncommon word choices, and minor stylistic tweaks could improve naturalness. Nonetheless, the podcast script remains engaging and faithful to the original message.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18/20."
