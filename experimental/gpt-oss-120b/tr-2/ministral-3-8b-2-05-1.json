  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are clear and the logical flow of the dialogue is preserved. A few parenthetical notes (e.g., the remark about keeping the French intro) are unnecessary and slightly interrupt the reading flow, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, but there are some inconsistencies and slightly awkward choices. \"El afinado\" is used instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\", and occasional literal renderings (“revelar”, “afinar”) feel a bit forced. Overall the language is smooth for a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled well: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding, etc. The occasional shift between \"ajuste fino\" and \"afinado\" reduces consistency, and some English words (prompt, fine‑tuning) are left in italics, which is acceptable but could be uniformly translated.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator kept the tone of a podcast dialogue and adapted cultural references appropriately (e.g., using Spanish‑style analogies). The added note about possibly keeping the French intro shows awareness of the target audience, though it is not strictly needed. The overall intent of the original is well conveyed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the ideas and details from the original script are present. No substantive information is lost, and the extra explanatory note about the intro does not distort the content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the technical content clearly. It is readable and largely natural, with only minor inconsistencies in terminology and a few stylistic choices that could be refined. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts."
