  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear order. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia and aprendizaje en contexto are explained in a way that a non‑expert listener can follow. Minor issues (e.g., occasional long sentences) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are a few inconsistencies and slightly awkward phrases: the switch between \"usted\" and \"tú\" (\"Usted ha entendido todo\" vs the rest in informal \"tú\"), \"Se pueden tener una conversación\" (should be \"Se puede tener\"), and \"El aprendizaje contextual en acción\" (more idiomatic would be \"El aprendizaje en contexto en acción\"). These quirks lower the fluency a bit.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled very well. Key terms are kept consistent (preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje). The occasional synonym \"afinamiento\" appears only in the original, not the translation, which is acceptable. No major mistranslations of technical concepts.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the podcast tone and adapts expressions for a Spanish‑speaking audience (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", \"hoja de trucos\"). Cultural references are neutral, and the intent of the original dialogue is preserved. The only drawback is the mixed register caused by the inconsistent use of \"usted\"/\"tú\".",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No content has been omitted, and no unnecessary additions were made. The translation maintains the same structure and length, ensuring completeness.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and keeps the conversational style of the podcast. Minor stylistic issues—mainly the inconsistent use of formal vs. informal address and a few slightly clunky sentences—prevent it from being perfect, but they do not affect the overall understanding. With a small editorial pass to harmonize the register and smooth a few phrases, the text would be excellent.\n\nOverall score: 91/100."
