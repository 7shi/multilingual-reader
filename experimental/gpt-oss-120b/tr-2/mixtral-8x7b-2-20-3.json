  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas and the technical concepts are explained in plain language. Some sentences are long and could be split for better flow, but a native reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly naturally, but there are several awkward expressions (e.g., \"ancraje\" instead of the more common \"anclaje\", redundant phrasing in \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL en inglés), o aprendizaje en contexto en español\", and occasional literal renderings like \"prompt\"). These hiccups prevent the text from sounding completely smooth to a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje de transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL). The choice of \"ancraje\" for grounding is unconventional, and the English word \"prompt\" is left untranslated, but overall the terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast name to \"Tecnología al Instante\" but later reverts to the original French title, which creates a small inconsistency. Cultural references are minimal, and some expressions could be better localized, but the overall intent and tone are preserved.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent knowledge distinction, and the explanation of \"memoria\" features. No essential information is omitted, and the content remains faithful to the source.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the substance of the original French podcast accurately and is largely understandable. It would benefit from polishing some awkward phrasing, correcting the term \"ancraje\" to a more idiomatic word, ensuring consistent use of the podcast title, and translating a few remaining English terms. With these refinements the text would read more naturally and feel fully adapted to a Spanish‑speaking audience.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
