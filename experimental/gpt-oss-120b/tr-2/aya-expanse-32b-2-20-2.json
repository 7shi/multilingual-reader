  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. Most sentences are logical, but a few awkward phrasings (e.g., “¿Es decir, quieres que te explique el concepto con más detalle?”) slightly disrupt the flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several moments where the wording feels stilted or overly literal (“Este enfoque revolucionario se conoce como aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”, “el ‘módulo de memoria’”). These reduce the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, transferencia de aprendizaje, ventana contextual, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, y anclaje are correctly rendered and used consistently throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, but occasional added commentary not present in the source (e.g., the meta‑question about explaining the concept) and some culturally neutral phrasing could be smoother. Overall the message is conveyed correctly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted; only minor redundant or extra sentences appear, which do not affect completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation does a solid job of conveying the podcast’s technical discussion in Spanish. Terminology is handled well and the content is complete, but the flow suffers from a few literal translations and unnecessary insertions that affect naturalness. With minor stylistic revisions the text would read as a native‑speaker level podcast script.\nOverall score (average): 16/20."
