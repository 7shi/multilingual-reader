    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original logical flow. However, several pronoun choices (e.g., “Ustedes” instead of the more natural “tú” or “vosotros”) make the speech sound overly formal for a podcast. The verb “cachear” is a slang term for “cheat” and does not convey the intended meaning of “cramming”. Minor lexical slips such as “temporario” (should be “temporal”) also affect smooth comprehension. Overall, a reader can follow the discussion, but these hiccups lower the ease of reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds fairly literal and retains most of the French phrasing, which leads to occasional awkwardness in Spanish. Phrases like “Ustedes han comprendido todo” and “Ustedes pueden tomar un modelo” are not idiomatic. The misuse of “cachear” further reduces naturalness. Despite these issues, sentence structures are mostly correct and the text does not contain major grammatical errors.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Core terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto” (ICL) and “grounding” are either correctly translated or kept in the original form with explanations. Consistency is maintained throughout the dialogue, and the translator avoids unnecessary simplifications that could dilute meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone of a podcast discussion. Cultural adaptation is mostly adequate, but the choice of second‑person plural (“Ustedes”) feels out of place for a conversational format that would more naturally use the informal singular. The inappropriate slang “cachear” also reflects a mismatch with the target audience. These minor mismatches keep the adaptation from being fully optimal.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information present in the French script is retained in the Spanish version. No sentences or concepts are omitted, and the explanatory details (e.g., the distinction between temporary knowledge and permanent skill) are fully preserved. The translation is therefore complete and faithful to the source.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does an admirable job of preserving the technical content and overall structure of the original French podcast script. Terminology is accurate and consistent, and no substantive information is lost. The main drawbacks are stylistic: the use of formal plural pronouns and the incorrect slang term “cachear” detract from natural spoken Spanish, making the dialogue feel a bit stilted for a podcast audience. Minor lexical errors (e.g., “temporario”) also affect readability. With a few adjustments to pronoun choice, idiomatic phrasing, and word selection, the translation would reach a higher level of fluency and readability.\nOverall, the work is solid and functional, suitable for a technical audience, but it falls short of sounding completely natural in everyday Spanish conversation.\nFinal averaged score: 16.8 ≈ 17/20."
