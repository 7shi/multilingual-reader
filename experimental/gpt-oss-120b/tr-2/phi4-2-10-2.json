  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured, and complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in simple language. A few sentences feel slightly literal (e.g., “para proporcionarle una educación básica o general”), but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural for native speakers. Vocabulary is appropriate and the flow is smooth. Minor awkwardness appears in a couple of places – “El modelo mismo no aprende…” could be phrased “El propio modelo no aprende…”, and “una ventana de discusión” is a literal translation of “fenêtre de discussion”. These issues are small and do not break fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, anclaje, memoria. The English abbreviations are kept, which is standard in the field. Consistency is maintained throughout the dialogue.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French tone to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and idiomatic expressions such as “consultor brillante” and “asesor temporal o especialista permanente” work well. No French‑specific idioms remain untranslated, so the intent is fully preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original script is present. No content is omitted, and no extra, unnecessary material is added. The explanations about temporary vs. permanent knowledge, the “memoria” feature, and the analogy of studying for an exam are all retained accurately.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical concepts accurately, reads naturally for a Spanish audience, and respects the original’s pedagogical tone. Minor stylistic tweaks could make it a bit smoother, but the translation is functionally excellent.\n\nScore out of 100: 92/100."
