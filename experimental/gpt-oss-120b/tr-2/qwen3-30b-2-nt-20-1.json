  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the original flow, but there are a few gaps that hurt comprehension. A whole question line (\"Camille: C’est‑à‑dire ?\") is missing, creating a brief discontinuity. Some sentences are a bit long or use mixed formal/informal pronouns, which can momentarily confuse the listener. Overall, a native Spanish speaker could follow the content, but the missing line and occasional abruptness lower the score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly natural, but several constructions sound awkward: \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje\" is not idiomatic, and there is redundancy in \"Esta metodología se llama aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\". The mix of \"usted\" and informal tones is inconsistent. These issues prevent the text from sounding completely smooth to a native ear.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well. \"Preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" and \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\" are correctly rendered and used consistently. The word \"prompt\" is left in English, which is acceptable in a technical podcast context. No major terminology errors were found.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone (podcast dialogue), and explanatory style. Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is needed. However, the mixed register (formal \"usted\" vs informal) slightly reduces the natural fit for a casual podcast audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all the original information is conveyed, but the omission of Camille’s \"C’est‑à‑dire ?\" question removes a small explanatory cue. Apart from that, the content is complete; no major facts are lost, but the missing line counts against completeness.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of conveying the technical discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning. Terminology is accurate and consistent, and the overall meaning is preserved. Readability and fluency are slightly compromised by a missing question line and a few non‑idiomatic expressions, and the mixed formal/informal register creates minor inconsistencies. Minor edits to fill the gap and smooth the wording would raise the quality to a near‑native level.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
