  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.) are clear. A few sentences are a bit long, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native Spanish speaker. Most expressions are idiomatic, punctuation follows Spanish conventions, and the tone matches a podcast script. Minor hiccups such as “comienzas de cero en términos de contexto” and the slight redundancy in “aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)” prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje\", etc. The chosen terms are consistent throughout and appropriate for the target audience. The only small point is the use of \"afinamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\", but it is still understandable.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts stylistic elements to Spanish (exclamation marks, informal but professional tone). Cultural references are neutral, so no loss of meaning. The adaptation is effective, with only very minor literal renderings that could be smoother.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information present in the French original is conveyed in the Spanish version. No key idea is omitted, and the examples remain intact. Redundancies do not cause loss of content; they only slightly affect conciseness.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, reads well, and feels natural to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor stylistic refinements could raise fluency a point or two, but the work is solid and faithful to the source.\n\nStrengths: precise terminology, clear explanations, faithful preservation of the podcast’s conversational style. \nAreas for improvement: smooth some literal phrasings and eliminate a few redundant parenthetical repetitions.\n\nOverall score reflects a strong performance with room for minor polish.\n\nScore out of 20 points: 18\n\n---\n**Scoring Summary**\n- Readability: 18/20\n- Fluency: 17/20\n- Terminology: 19/20\n- Contextual Adaptation: 18/20\n- Information Completeness: 20/20\n- **Overall:** 18/20"
