  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and complex concepts are explained with clear examples. Minor punctuation issues do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural, but a few expressions are slightly awkward (e.g., \"Podríamos decir eso\", \"Es una observación muy acertada\"). Vocabulary is appropriate and the register matches a podcast dialogue.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are correctly rendered and used consistently throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original tone to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using idiomatic phrasing (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", \"una antisèche\") and culturally neutral examples. The podcast name is localized to \"Luz Tech\" which fits the context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the ideas, examples and nuances from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is lost, and the explanatory details are retained.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational style of the podcast, and is largely fluent and readable. A few minor stylistic tweaks could make it sound even more natural, but the translation succeeds in delivering the original intent without loss of information.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18/20."
