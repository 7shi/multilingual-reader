    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Most sentences convey the original meaning, but occasional missing accents or punctuation (e.g., “De acuerdo” without period, “El pre‑entrenamiento.”) slightly hinder smooth reading. Overall, a native speaker would understand the content without major effort.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several awkward or un‑natural expressions: “Inteligencia Conversacional Limitada (ICL)” instead of the correct “Aprendizaje en Contexto (ICL)”, the incomplete sentence “La forma ideal de abordar el problema es.”, and inconsistent pronoun use (“tus” vs. “vuestras”). Some literal translations (“una antisèche”) feel out of place in Spanish. These issues reduce the natural flow.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, anclaje, ventana de contexto, etc. The main problem is the mis‑labeling of ICL and occasional omission of English acronyms that are common in the field. Nonetheless, the key concepts remain identifiable.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone, but some cultural‑linguistic choices are off (e.g., “vuestras discusiones” mixed with “tus”). The note about an alternative translation that appears in the source is left in the output, which is unnecessary for the target audience. Overall, the adaptation is adequate but not polished.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present in the Spanish version, and no essential information is lost. The only minor drawback is the inclusion of a meta‑comment about translation alternatives, which does not affect factual completeness. The content is therefore largely complete.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in transmitting the core message of the podcast and is mostly understandable. However, it suffers from several fluency and terminology inaccuracies, inconsistent pronoun usage, and a few unnatural phrasings that a native speaker would likely edit. With a careful revision of the problematic terms (especially ICL) and smoother sentence constructions, the quality would improve markedly.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 72/100."
