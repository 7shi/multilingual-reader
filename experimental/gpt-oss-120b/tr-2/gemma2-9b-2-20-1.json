  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, etc.) are well articulated. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., \"se lee\" instead of \"se leen\") do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, using idiomatic Spanish and appropriate register for a podcast. A few constructions feel slightly stiff (e.g., \"Los nuevos conocimientos se integran permanentemente a su conocimiento\"), and occasional word choices could be smoother, but nothing breaks the flow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". The parenthetical English terms help readers familiar with the original jargon. No important term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish well (\"¡Hola y bienvenidos!\", \"consultor brillante\"). Some cultural nuances from the French original (e.g., informal banter) are preserved, though a few phrases could be more colloquial to better match Spanish‑speaking audiences.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original script is retained. No ideas are omitted or added unnecessarily, and the logical progression of the discussion is preserved.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational podcast style, and is largely readable and fluent. Minor grammatical and stylistic tweaks could raise fluency and cultural resonance, but the core message is perfectly preserved.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18/20."
