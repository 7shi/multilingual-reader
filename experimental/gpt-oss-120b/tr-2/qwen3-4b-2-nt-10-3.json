  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas without excessive complexity, and the flow of the dialogue remains logical. Minor hiccups (e.g., occasional overly formal phrasing) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward or literal renderings: \"Usted ha comprendido todo\" (instead of a more natural \"¡Has captado todo!\"), \"Es una excelente puntualidad\" (should be \"es una excelente observación\"), and occasional over‑use of the formal \"usted\". These issues slightly reduce the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled. Key concepts such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", and \"ICL\" are correctly translated or retained, and the explanations remain accurate. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are neutral, and the conversational tone is preserved. Minor literal translations (e.g., \"punto crucial\") slightly affect naturalness but do not change meaning.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No content is omitted, and the dialogue structure is intact. No redundant material was added.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and keeps the podcast’s conversational style. A few unnatural phrases and overly formal pronouns prevent it from being completely fluent, but the meaning is fully preserved and the terminology is spot‑on. Minor polishing would bring it to near‑perfect native level.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
