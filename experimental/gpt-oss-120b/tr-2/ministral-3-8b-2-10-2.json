  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the sentences, while sometimes long, are easy to follow. Concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento y aprendizaje en contexto are explained clearly, allowing a non‑expert reader to grasp the ideas without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native speaker overall. A few minor constructions are slightly literal (e.g., \"aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\" or \"basada en sus conversaciones\"), but they do not impede understanding and the vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding/anclaje, etc. Acronyms are kept, and explanations are provided when needed, showing a solid handling of the terminology.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapted the podcast name and overall tone to Spanish culture (\"Luz Tech\", \"Iluminación Tecnológica\"). The examples and analogies remain relevant, and there are no culturally jarring expressions.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present. No relevant detail is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, preserving the pedagogical tone of the original podcast while rendering the technical content accurately and understandably in Spanish. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but they do not detract from the overall effectiveness of the translation."
