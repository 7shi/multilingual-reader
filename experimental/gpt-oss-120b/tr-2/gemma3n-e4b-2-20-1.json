  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the dialogue format is preserved, allowing readers to understand the discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning. Minor issues such as inconsistent pronouns (\"tus\" vs \"vuestras\") and a typo in the translation of \"grounding\" (written as \"atrición\") slightly hinder smooth comprehension, but they do not break understanding.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most parts. Vocabulary is appropriate and the conversational tone matches the original podcast script. Small awkwardness appears in a few expressions (e.g., \"¡Bienvenido/a a « Tech Éclair »\", \"el modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de vuestras conversaciones\") and the misuse of \"atrición\", but overall a native speaker would find it fluent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are correctly rendered. The main problem is the translation of the concept \"grounding\" as \"atrición\", which is not a recognized term in Spanish and can confuse readers. This inconsistency reduces the score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator kept the original intent, humor, and educational purpose. The adaptation to Spanish‑speaking listeners (e.g., using inclusive \"Bienvenido/a\") is appropriate. Apart from the erroneous \"atrición\", the cultural and contextual adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French source are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent knowledge distinction, and the explanation of the new \"Memoria\" feature. No significant information is omitted; only the terminology error slightly affects completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is clear, faithful to the source, and maintains the podcast’s engaging style. The main weakness lies in the mistranslation of the term \"grounding\" as \"atrición\", which could mislead readers unfamiliar with the concept. Minor stylistic inconsistencies (pronoun use, occasional awkward phrasing) are present but do not seriously impede understanding. With a corrected term and a bit of polishing, the translation would be excellent.\n\n**Overall score:** 16/20 (average of the five criteria)."
