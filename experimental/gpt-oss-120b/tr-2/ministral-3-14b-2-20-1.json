  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. However, the presence of editorial notes, parenthetical alternatives and occasional literal translations (e.g., “engager un consultant brillant”, “(or alternatively: …)”) creates interruptions that hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound natural, but there are several awkward constructions and leftover French/English fragments that break the fluency (“engager un consultant brillant”, “(or alternatively: **todo la conversación mantenida en esta sesión**…)”). Vocabulary is appropriate, yet the mixed‑language insertions make the text feel less polished for native speakers.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly well‑handled: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (AEC), grounding rendered as “anclaje a la realidad”, etc. Minor inconsistencies appear (preentrenamiento vs. preentrenado) but they do not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish, using appropriate greetings and cultural references. The main drawback is the retention of untranslated fragments and bracketed editorial remarks, which reduce the sense of a fully localized text.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the main ideas from the original script are conveyed: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent knowledge distinction, and the explanation of “memory” features. No substantial content is lost, though a few small nuances are slightly blurred by the untranslated bits.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the substance of the original French podcast and generally conveys the technical concepts clearly. Strengths lie in accurate terminology and faithful content transfer. Weaknesses are mainly editorial leftovers and occasional literal phrasing that interrupt readability and naturalness. A clean, final pass to remove the bracketed notes and translate the remaining French/English fragments would raise the quality substantially.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 15/20.\nScore: 15"
