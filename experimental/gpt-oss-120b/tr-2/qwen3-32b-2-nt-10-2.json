    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas are easy to follow. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in simple language. A few long sentences and occasional mixed registers (formal ‘usted’ vs. informal ‘tú’) slightly affect flow, but overall a native reader can understand without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, but there are several spots that feel a bit stiff or inconsistent (e.g., “Usted lo ha entendido perfectamente”, “El afinamiento” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”, and occasional punctuation oddities). Vocabulary is appropriate, yet the mix of formal and informal pronouns creates a minor jarring effect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely well‑handled: ‘pre‑entrenamiento’, ‘aprendizaje por transferencia’, ‘ventana de contexto’, ‘anclaje’, and ‘aprendizaje en contexto’ are accurate. The term ‘fine‑tuning’ is rendered as ‘afinamiento’, which is understandable but less common than ‘ajuste fino’. Consistency is good and no key term is omitted.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast’s informal, conversational tone and adapts cultural references appropriately. The only drawback is the inconsistent use of formal versus informal address, which can slightly distract Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is retained. No sentences or ideas are omitted, and the logical progression of the discussion is intact. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the original content accurately. Minor issues such as inconsistent pronoun choice, a few unnatural phrasing choices, and the handling of the term ‘fine‑tuning’ prevent it from being completely seamless, but the meaning, technical accuracy, and readability are well preserved.\n\nStrengths: clear explanation of complex AI concepts, consistent use of technical vocabulary, faithful transmission of the original structure.\nWeaknesses: occasional register mismatch, a less‑common translation for ‘fine‑tuning’, and a few slightly awkward sentences.\n\nThe translation would be excellent with a final editorial pass to smooth out these stylistic quirks.\n\nScore (average of the five criteria): 16.6 → 17/20."
