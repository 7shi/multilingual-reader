    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas are conveyed in an understandable way. Most sentences follow a logical order and the concepts are explained similarly to the original. A few minor grammatical slips (e.g., *\"bienvenido en\"* instead of *\"bienvenido a\"*, missing opening inverted exclamation marks) slightly hinder smooth reading, but they do not obscure meaning.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several expressions that feel unnatural to native speakers: *\"Hola y bienvenido en\"*, *\"el podcast donde nosotros deciframos\"*, the retention of the French word *\"antisèche\"*, and the odd phrasing *\"silla de bicicleta\"*. The overall flow is acceptable, yet these awkward spots make the text sound translated rather than native.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *anclaje*, etc. The term *prompt* is left untranslated, which is acceptable in a technical audience, but the French slang *antisèche* should have been rendered in Spanish (*chuleta*, *colilla*). Consistency is good overall, with a few lapses.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal podcast tone and the pedagogical intent. Cultural adaptation is mostly fine, but the use of untranslated French words (*antisèche*) and a few clumsy constructions reduce the naturalness for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The overall message and style are retained.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original script is present; no major ideas or details are omitted. Minor typographic issues (missing «¡» symbols) do not affect content. The translation is complete and faithful to the source.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full content of the original French podcast and keeps the educational, conversational tone. Technical terminology is largely accurate, and no substantive information is lost. However, the text suffers from several fluency and naturalness problems—most notably the use of \"bienvenido en\", the retention of French slang \"antisèche\", and some awkward phrasing—that make it feel less native. Improving these points would raise the overall quality significantly. The current version scores solidly in completeness and terminology but needs refinement in fluency and contextual adaptation to reach a higher level of polish.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15.6/20."
