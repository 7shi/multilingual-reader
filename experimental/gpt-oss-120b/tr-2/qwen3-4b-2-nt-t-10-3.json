  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure, but there are several small grammatical slips (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenido en\" instead of \"a\", mixed use of \"Usted\" and \"tú\"). Some sentences are slightly convoluted, which can make the flow less smooth for native readers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are multiple unnatural expressions: \"Usted ha entendido todo\", \"es una trampa\" for \"bachotage\", and the invented word \"antiespuma\" for \"antisèche\". These choices break the naturalness of the dialogue and feel forced or incorrect.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" and \"grounding\" are correctly kept, often with the original English in parentheses. However, a few translations misinterpret the concept (e.g., \"trampa\" for \"bachotage\", \"antiespuma\" for \"antisèche\"), which can confuse readers about the intended meaning.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly conveys the original intent, but the register shifts (mix of formal \"Usted\" and informal \"tú\") and some culturally odd phrasing (\"Hola y bienvenido en\") reduce the natural adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent knowledge distinction, and the explanation of “memory” features. No significant information is omitted, and the content remains faithful to the source.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core content and most technical concepts accurately, but it suffers from several linguistic inaccuracies and awkward phrasings that affect readability and naturalness. Terminology is largely correct, though a few mistranslations (e.g., \"antiespuma\") could mislead readers. With minor revisions to correct grammar, harmonize the register, and replace the erroneous lexical choices, the text would reach a much higher quality level.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14/20."
