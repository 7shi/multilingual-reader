  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and follows the logical flow of the original dialogue. Most sentences are easy to understand, and the complex ideas (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje en contexto) are explained coherently. Minor issues such as the gender error “ajuste fina” instead of “ajuste fino” and occasional long sentences slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are a few awkward constructions: the sudden switch to the formal ‘Usted’ (“Usted ha entendido todo”) in a conversational podcast, the literal “fundamentación” for ‘grounding’, and the repeated typo “ajuste fina”. These reduce the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely well‑handled: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”. The only notable mismatch is “fundamentación” for grounding, where “anclaje” or “acople” would be more usual. Consistency is otherwise good.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish effectively, preserving the explanatory style and cultural neutrality. Some stylistic inconsistencies (formal vs. informal pronouns) and the literal rendering of certain phrases prevent a fully polished adaptation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No key points are omitted, and the explanations remain complete and accurate.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and maintains a clear explanatory structure, making it suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts. Strengths lie in the faithful rendering of technical content and overall completeness. Weaknesses are mainly typographical (\"ajuste fina\"), occasional formality shifts, and a few less‑natural term choices (\"fundamentación\"). With minor edits, the text would read as a fully natural podcast script in Spanish.\nOverall quality is good but not perfect, reflecting solid competence with room for polishing of style and terminology.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16.8 → 17/20.\n\nScore out of 20 points: 17"
