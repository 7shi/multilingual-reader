  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the dialogue flows naturally. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained clearly, and the analogies (consultant, bike‑riding, cramming for an exam) are preserved. A few minor awkward phrasings (e.g., “el preentrenamiento” repeated, “ventana de contexto” rendered only as “contexto”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural to a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. There are occasional stiff constructions (e.g., “el modelo experto en inglés” instead of “un modelo experto”, gendering IA as “ella”) and some redundancy, but these are minor and do not break fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well handled: “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje contextual (ICL)”, “anclaje (grounding)”. The translation keeps the acronyms and explains them. The only slight loss is the specific phrase “ventana de contexto”, which is simplified to “contexto”. Otherwise terminology is consistent and suitable for the target audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French tone and purpose effectively for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Cultural references are neutral and the podcast‑style banter is preserved. The brand name “Tech Éclair” is rendered as “Tecnología Rápida”, which is a reasonable localisation, though a literal keep‑as‑is could be considered. Overall the intent and style are maintained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original script is present: the stages of model training, the distinction between permanent knowledge (fine‑tuning) and temporary knowledge (in‑context learning), the explanation of “memory” features, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. No major facts are omitted; only minor phrasing differences that do not affect content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, keeps the conversational tone, and is largely readable and natural for Spanish speakers. Minor issues—such as a few stiff sentences, the gendering of IA, and the simplification of “ventana de contexto”—prevent a perfect score but do not significantly detract from the overall effectiveness of the translation.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18 out of 20."
