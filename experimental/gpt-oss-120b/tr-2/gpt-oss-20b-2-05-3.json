    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the dialogue format and the logical flow of the original French script. Sentences are generally short and clear, making the technical discussion easy to follow for a non‑expert audience. A few minor stylistic choices (e.g., the formal “Usted” in a podcast that feels informal) slightly affect the ease of reading, but the overall comprehension is excellent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, with appropriate vocabulary and correct grammar. There are a handful of slightly awkward or overly formal expressions – such as “Usted ha entendido todo” instead of a more colloquial “Lo has entendido” – and the use of “el afinamiento” where “ajuste fino” would be more idiomatic. These issues do not impede understanding but prevent the text from feeling completely native‑speaker‑like.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)*, *anclaje*, etc. The translator kept the original acronyms and gave clear explanations when needed. Only a minor point is the retention of “grounding” as “anclaje” without a brief definition, but the surrounding context makes it clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone, but it occasionally misses the informal, conversational register typical of a podcast. The use of the formal second‑person pronoun “Usted” and the literal rendering of some expressions (“consultor brillante”) make the text feel slightly stilted for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience. Cultural adaptation could be improved by using a more relaxed register (tú, vos) and by adjusting idioms to match typical Spanish‑language tech podcasts.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No sentences or ideas have been omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The technical explanations and analogies are fully retained, ensuring that the listener receives the same content as the original.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is very good. It faithfully reproduces the content and technical depth of the original French script, and the language is largely clear and accurate. The main areas for improvement are the register (making it more informal) and smoothing out a few awkward phrasing choices. With those minor adjustments, the text would feel completely natural for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience.\n\n**Total score (out of 100): 90**\n\nThe translation demonstrates strong competence in technical terminology and completeness, while readability and fluency are high but not perfect due to stylistic mismatches with the intended podcast tone."
