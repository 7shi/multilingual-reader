  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are generally clear and the logical flow of the dialogue is preserved. Minor hiccups such as very long sentences or the occasional parenthetical note do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places. Word choice and grammar are appropriate for a native speaker, though a few expressions are slightly clunky (e.g., \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\"). Overall the text reads smoothly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely rendered correctly (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL). The word \"ancrage\" is left in French with an English parenthesis, which is a small inconsistency; otherwise terminology is consistent and appropriate.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The podcast name is adapted (TecnoRelámpago) and cultural references are well‑adjusted. The ending adds a Spanish‑style title \"¡Destellos Tecnológicos!\" which fits the target audience. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenido\") are acceptable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the original script are present. No substantive information is omitted, and the translation maintains the same examples and analogies. The only addition is a parenthetical English note at the very end, which does not affect completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the original content accurately, uses appropriate technical language, and reads naturally for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor inconsistencies in terminology and a few slightly awkward phrasings keep it just short of perfection, but the text is fully understandable and faithful to the source.\nScore out of 100: 85/100."
