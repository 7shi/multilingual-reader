  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure, but there are several awkward phrasings and a few grammatical mistakes (e.g., \"El AI\" instead of \"la IA\", missing accents, and a literal repetition of the opening line). These hiccups slightly impede smooth comprehension, especially for readers unfamiliar with the source language.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural expressions and literal borrowings from French (e.g., \"bachotage\", \"ancraje\" instead of \"anclaje\", \"El aprendizaje de idiomas asistido por computadora\" which distorts the intended meaning). The flow is choppy in places, making it feel like a word‑for‑word translation rather than natural Spanish.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly kept, but some are mistranslated or left in French. \"Fine‑tuning\" becomes \"afinar al IA\" (grammatically incorrect), \"grounding\" is rendered as \"ancraje\" (misspelt), and \"In‑Context Learning\" is rendered oddly as \"El aprendizaje de idiomas asistido por computadora\". Consistency suffers, reducing clarity for a technical audience.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation occasionally adapts cultural references (e.g., \"Tech Iluminación\"), but inconsistently reverts to the original French name at the end. Some French idioms are retained unchanged, and the overall tone feels more like a direct copy than a version tailored for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the original are present: pre‑training, transfer learning, fine‑tuning vs. in‑context learning, the temporary nature of prompt‑based knowledge, and the simulated \"memory\" feature. Minor nuances are lost or slightly altered, but no critical information is omitted.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core concepts of the podcast episode, but it is marred by frequent literal renderings, grammatical slips, and inconsistent terminology. While a Spanish‑speaking reader can grasp the main message, the text lacks the polish and naturalness expected of a professional translation, especially for a technical audience. Improving terminology consistency, fixing grammatical errors, and adapting idiomatic expressions would raise the quality substantially.\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 64/100.\nRecommendations: revise the mistranslated technical terms, eliminate French leftovers, correct gender and article agreement, and smooth out sentence flow for native‑speaker readability.\n\n**Breakdown** – Readability: 14/20, Fluency: 12/20, Terminology: 11/20, Contextual Adaptation: 12/20, Information Completeness: 15/20.\n\nFuture revisions should aim for a total above 80/100 to meet a high‑quality standard for technical Spanish translations.\n\n**Overall rating:** 64/100 (average 12.8/20 per criterion)."
