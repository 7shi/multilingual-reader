  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are generally clear and the dialogue format is preserved. Minor issues such as the gender‑specific “bienvenida” for a mixed audience and a couple of long sentences slightly affect flow, but overall the reader can understand the concepts without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic, though there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., \"una gran cantidad de datos\" instead of \"una gran cantidad\", \"el modelo mismo\" instead of simply \"el modelo\"). These do not impede comprehension but slightly reduce naturalness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and the parenthetical clarification of \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\" are accurate. \"Afinamiento\" is less common than \"fine‑tuning\" or \"ajuste fino\", but it is understandable in context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone, adapting the content for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Cultural references are neutral, and the explanatory style is preserved. Small stylistic choices (e.g., \"¡Hola y bienvenida\") could be more inclusive, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted or altered, and the technical explanations remain intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It successfully transmits the technical discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning and the emerging memory features of AI models. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency suffers only from a handful of minor phrasing quirks. The result is a clear, accurate, and engaging Spanish version of the podcast script.\n\nOverall score (average): 18.2/20."
