    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. Most ideas are clear, but occasional overly long sentences and unnecessary meta‑comments (e.g., the note about the verb “leerá”) interrupt the smooth reading experience. Minor punctuation errors (missing closing quotes, inconsistent use of ¡/¿) also affect readability.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural expressions that a native speaker would not use in a podcast script: “el ajuste” for fine‑tuning, the parenthetical comment about verb tense, and some literal renderings (“la IA no ha “olvidado” en el sentido humano”). The overall tone feels stilted and the mixture of exclamation marks and periods is inconsistent, reducing the natural flow.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), grounding → anclaje, etc. However, “fine‑tuning” is rendered only as “el ajuste” instead of the more precise “ajuste fino” or “afinamiento”, and occasional inconsistencies (e.g., “afilamiento” later appears) could confuse readers. Overall the terminology is adequate but not perfectly consistent.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely keeps the original intent, but the inserted explanatory note about the verb tense and the overly literal phrasing sometimes break the conversational tone expected for a podcast. Cultural adaptation is minimal, which is acceptable, but the extra commentary is out of place and detracts from the original’s concise style.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory tricks, etc. No significant content is omitted. The only drawback is the addition of superfluous remarks that do not belong to the source, which, while not removing information, adds noise.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core ideas of the original podcast and includes all essential information, but it suffers from several stylistic and linguistic issues. Unnecessary editorial comments, inconsistent terminology, and occasional awkward phrasing reduce its naturalness and readability for a Spanish‑speaking audience. With a more polished, podcast‑appropriate tone and tighter handling of technical terms, the translation would be much stronger.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14/20."
