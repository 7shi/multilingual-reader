  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are clear. A few long sentences could be split, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are several awkward spots and a clear typo (\"las leys del equilibrio\"). Phrases such as \"El 'preentrenamiento' es una fase fundamental en la formación de modelos de inteligencia artificial\" are acceptable but a bit heavy. The duplication of \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\" after introducing the acronym ICL also feels redundant.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled consistently: preentrenamiento, afinamiento (ajuste fino), aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje (grounding). The term \"prompt\" is correctly rendered as \"solicitud\". The only minor issue is the choice of \"anclaje\" for \"grounding\", which is acceptable in Spanish technical discourse.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts idiomatically for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The consulting analogy and the discussion of memory features are conveyed naturally, with only slight stylistic roughness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present. No key ideas are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary material. The content remains faithful and complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. Readability and terminology are strong, but fluency suffers from a few awkward constructions and a typo, which prevent it from being completely polished. With minor edits, it would be excellent for a Spanish‑language podcast script.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 17/20.\nScore out of 20 points: 17"
