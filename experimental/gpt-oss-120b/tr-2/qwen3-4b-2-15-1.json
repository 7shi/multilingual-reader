  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences convey the original ideas and the logical flow of the podcast dialogue is preserved. Minor issues such as \"Hola y bienvenido en\" instead of \"Hola y bienvenido a\" or \"exponer la forma\" slightly affect smoothness, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several unnatural constructions and grammatical slips: \"Yo he entendido todo\" (should be \"Lo has entendido\" or \"Usted ha entendido\"), gender agreement errors like \"las conocimientos\", verb form errors such as \"al transfiriendo\" (should be \"al transferir\") and \"empieze\" (should be \"empiece\"). The mix of formal \"Usted\" and informal \"tú\" is inconsistent. These issues make the text sound less native, though the overall meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly translated and consistently used: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\" (acceptable alternative to \"ajuste fino\"), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". The translation respects the specialist audience and does not introduce confusing jargon.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation faithfully conveys the original intent and tone of a podcast discussion. Cultural references are preserved, and the explanations remain appropriate for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Some literal renderings (e.g., \"la IA no ha olvidado en el sentido humano\") feel a bit stiff, but they do not distort the message.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is omitted, and the dialogue structure is kept intact. Minor typographical errors do not result in loss of meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in delivering the full technical content of the original podcast and uses appropriate terminology. Readability is good, but fluency suffers from several grammatical and stylistic errors that make the text feel less natural to native speakers. Minor wording choices could be refined (e.g., \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\" instead of \"afinamiento\"). Overall, the translation is solid in completeness and technical accuracy, but would benefit from a careful proofreading pass to improve naturalness and consistency.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17/20."
