  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the complex ideas about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in plain language. Minor inconsistencies such as using both “pre‑entrenamiento” and “preentrenamiento” slightly affect flow, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few literal renderings betray the French source (e.g., “Mire:” instead of a more idiomatic “Mira,” and “cramming” left in English). Some verb choices (“exponerle” or “una cantidad significativamente menor”) are a bit stiff. Overall, a native speaker would understand without effort, yet a few phrases feel slightly awkward.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento,” “ajuste fino,” “aprendizaje por transferencia,” “ventana de contexto,” “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL).” The translation of “grounding” as “fundamentación” is acceptable, though “anclaje” alone might be clearer. Consistency is maintained throughout, and the terminology matches what Spanish‑speaking AI practitioners expect.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the podcast tone and keeps the informal, conversational style. Cultural references are neutral, so no adaptation is required. Small issues such as the literal “Mire:” and occasional French‑style punctuation reduce the naturalness for a Spanish audience, but the intent and register are preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are retained: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning, the analogy of temporary vs. permanent knowledge, the explanation of “memory” features, and the consultant vs. expert metaphor. No significant content is lost or added.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does an excellent job conveying the technical content and the podcast’s lively dialogue. Readability and completeness are strong, and terminology is accurate. Fluency suffers from a handful of literal phrases that could be smoother, and a couple of minor stylistic choices prevent it from being perfectly idiomatic. With slight polishing—especially replacing “Mire:” with a natural Spanish cue and choosing more colloquial equivalents for a few words—the text would feel completely natural to Spanish‑speaking listeners.\nOverall score (out of 100): 85/100."
