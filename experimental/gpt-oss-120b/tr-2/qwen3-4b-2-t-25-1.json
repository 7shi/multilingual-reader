  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure, but several sentences are awkward or contain incorrect word choices (e.g., “aplasta en la víspera”, “antiestación”). These reduce smooth comprehension for native readers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are noticeable unnatural expressions and some grammatical oddities (e.g., “antiestación”, “aplastar en la víspera”, duplicated “(anclaje)”). While most of the dialogue flows, the overall fluency feels slightly forced.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL” are correctly rendered and consistent. The only minor lapse is leaving the French word “Mémoire” untranslated.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and explanatory tone, but some cultural/linguistic choices are off (e.g., using “antiestación” instead of a more common Spanish term like “chuleta”). These affect the natural adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points, examples, and analogies from the French version are present. No significant information is omitted, and the technical content remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full meaning and technical depth of the original podcast script. However, several awkward phrasings, a few mistranslations, and the occasional retention of French terms hinder readability and naturalness. With some polishing—especially replacing odd word choices and fully localising terms—the text would reach a higher level of fluency and clarity.\nOverall score: 74/100."
