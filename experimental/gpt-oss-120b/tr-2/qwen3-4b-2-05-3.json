    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and conveys the main ideas. However, several sentences contain awkward phrasing or minor grammatical slips (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenido en\", \"el podcast donde nosotros deciframos\", \"una cantidad masiva de datos\"). These do not block comprehension but slightly reduce flow for native readers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds somewhat stilted in places. Word choices such as \"bienvenido en\" instead of \"bienvenido a\", \"afinamiento\" (less common than \"ajuste fino\"), and occasional missing punctuation (exclamation marks) make the text feel less natural. Nonetheless, a native speaker can follow it without major difficulty.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje\". The term \"prompt\" is left untranslated, which is acceptable in a tech context. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone, but it leans toward literal rendering instead of fully adapting idioms to Spanish. Phrases like \"Hola y bienvenido en\" and \"el podcast donde nosotros deciframos\" could be rendered more naturally for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural adaptation is adequate but not optimal.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French original is present. No significant ideas are omitted, and the technical explanations remain intact. The translation is complete and faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation transmits the full content and technical details accurately, but its readability and naturalness suffer from several literal constructions and minor grammatical errors. Terminology is well‑managed, and no information is lost. With a few stylistic revisions to better suit Spanish idiom, the text would reach a higher level of fluency.\nOverall rating (average of the five criteria): 16/20.\nRecommended improvements: adjust introductory phrases (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenido a\"), replace less‑common terms like \"afinamiento\" with \"ajuste fino\", and smooth out sentence flow for a more native‑speaker feel.\n\nScore: 16"
