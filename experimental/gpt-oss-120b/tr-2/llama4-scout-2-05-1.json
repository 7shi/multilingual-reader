  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the original structure, but several meta‑comments and mixed‑language fragments (e.g., “or Es decir, ¿a qué te refieres? for a more conversational tone”, “o mantener ‘ICL’ con una nota aclaratoria…”) interrupt the flow. Additionally, the term “pre‑entrainamiento” mixes French spelling, which may confuse readers. These issues lower the ease of reading.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural, but there are a few awkward constructions and English loanwords left untouched (“prompt”, “memory”). Phrases like “El pre‑entrainamiento” and “El afinamiento” are acceptable, yet the presence of editorial notes and occasional literal translations make the text feel less smooth for native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly handled well: “fine‑tuning” → “afinamiento”, “transfer learning” → “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “in‑context learning (ICL)” → “aprendizaje en contexto”. The translation sometimes retains English terms (e.g., “prompt”, “memory”) without explanation, but overall the key concepts are correctly rendered and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and pedagogical tone of the original podcast are preserved, and cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, the leftover editorial instructions break immersion and reduce the sense that the text has been fully adapted to the target context.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All substantive information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the translation includes the same examples and explanations. The only drawback is the inclusion of extra meta‑notes, which are unnecessary but do not remove any content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and retains the educational purpose of the podcast. It would benefit from a clean‑up to remove editorial notes, standardize terminology (e.g., use \"pre‑entrenamiento\"), and replace remaining English words with their Spanish equivalents. After these edits, the text would be more readable and fluent for native Spanish speakers.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
