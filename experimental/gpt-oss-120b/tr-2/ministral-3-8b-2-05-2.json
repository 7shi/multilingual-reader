  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow, with clear sentence structures and logical flow. A few long sentences and the introductory note about keeping the French version could slightly disrupt the reading experience, but overall a Spanish‑speaking audience can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are occasional awkward phrasings (e.g., “afinar” instead of “ajuste fino”, “el afinado”). Some parenthetical explanations feel clunky, and a few verb choices are literal translations rather than idiomatic Spanish. Nevertheless, the language is fluent enough for native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, grounding, prompt, etc. Minor inconsistencies appear (e.g., “afinado” vs. “ajuste fino”), but the terminology remains accurate and consistent for the intended audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original intent and tone, adapting explanations for a Spanish‑speaking listener. The optional note about keeping the French intro shows cultural awareness. No major mis‑alignments with the target culture are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are retained: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory tricks, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. No essential information is lost, and the added note does not create misinformation.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and maintains the conversational style of the podcast. While readability and fluency are solid, a few literal translations and inconsistent terminology prevent it from being completely seamless. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation that would be well understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners interested in AI concepts.\n\nStrengths: clear presentation of complex ideas, correct technical vocabulary, faithful rendering of the original message. \nWeaknesses: occasional awkward phrasing and minor term inconsistencies (e.g., \"afinado\").\nOverall rating is strong but leaves room for minor polishing.\n\nScore: 17/20."
