  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the flow of ideas follows the original. However, there are several awkward constructions (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en”, “una cantidad muy menos de texto”, “reprobarle de nuevo los documentos”) that may force the reader to pause. Minor grammatical slips also affect smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound non‑native: mixed formal‑informal pronouns, misuse of prepositions, and literal translations (“en la Internet”, “Usted ha entendido todo”). These issues break the natural rhythm expected by a native speaker, even though the overall meaning is clear.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and “grounding” (anclaje) are correctly translated and used consistently. The occasional retention of English words like “prompt” is appropriate for the audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., the consultant analogy). Minor phrasing issues (e.g., “hola y bienvenido en”) slightly reduce the natural fit, but the overall message and tone are preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All relevant information from the French script is present. No major ideas are omitted, and the logical sequence is intact. Small redundancies are absent, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and retains the original structure, but it suffers from several non‑native phrasing choices and minor grammatical errors that affect readability and fluency. Terminology is strong, and the core information is fully transferred. With a bit more polishing to natural Spanish expression, the translation would be excellent for a native‑speaking audience seeking a clear explanation of AI training concepts.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 16/20."
