  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and follows a logical progression. Most sentences are easy to understand, and complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje y aprendizaje en contexto are explained with simple examples. A few phrases (e.g., “bagaje general” instead of the more natural “cultura general”) are slightly less idiomatic but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly overall and uses natural vocabulary. There are occasional literal renderings (“una gran ventana de contexto” could be “una ventana de contexto ampliada”) and the acronym change (ICL → AIC) feels a bit forced, but native speakers would find the text comfortable.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely well‑handled: “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”. The main inconsistency is the replacement of the original acronym ICL (In‑Context Learning) with AIC (Aprendizaje en Contexto) without explanation, which could confuse readers familiar with the English literature.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts examples to Spanish‑speaking listeners (e.g., “consultor brillante”). Cultural references are neutral, and the tone remains conversational and engaging, matching the podcast format.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are present: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto, diferencia entre conocimiento temporal y permanente, y la explicación de las funciones de “memoria”. No salient information is omitted, and no unnecessary repetitions were added.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, conveying the technical content accurately while keeping the dialogue lively and accessible. Minor issues—such as the unconventional choice of “bagaje general” and the unexplained acronym change—prevent a perfect score, but they do not significantly affect the reader’s understanding. Overall, the work demonstrates solid linguistic competence and good handling of technical material.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18/20."
