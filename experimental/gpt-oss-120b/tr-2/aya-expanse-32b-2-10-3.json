  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the logical flow mirrors the original. Most sentences are clear, but a few constructions are awkward (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto es como tener una memoria de elefante”) and some parentheses break the flow, slightly reducing comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural to a native speaker, with correct verb tenses and appropriate vocabulary. However, there are occasional literal translations and odd expressions (e.g., “memoria de elefante”, “una memoria temporal” used inconsistently) that feel slightly stilted.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “ICL”, “anclaje”. Some English words such as “prompt” are left untranslated, which is acceptable in a technical context, and the occasional English parenthetical (fine‑tuning) does not cause confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and purpose, but it includes editorial additions not present in the source (the parenthetical “Adición sugerida” note). Moreover, the mis‑rendered analogy about “memoria de elefante” changes the nuance, slightly weakening cultural and contextual alignment.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas and examples from the French script are present. Minor deviations—such as the altered elephant analogy and the extra explanatory note—do not omit essential information, but they add unnecessary material and a small distortion of meaning.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. Readability and terminology are strong, but fluency is occasionally hampered by literal phrasing, and the inclusion of editorial notes and a mis‑interpreted analogy detract from a fully polished version. With minor edits to smooth awkward expressions and remove the extra commentary, the translation would be excellent.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
