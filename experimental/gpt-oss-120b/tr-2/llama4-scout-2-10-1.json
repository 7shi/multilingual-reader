    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas are easy to follow. Sentences are a bit long in places but do not impede comprehension. The dialogue flow is preserved, allowing the listener to grasp the concepts without major difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation reads naturally, but there are several awkward spots: a meta‑comment about translation appears in the dialogue, the mix of formal \"Usted\" with informal \"tú\" creates inconsistency, and some expressions (e.g., \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\", \"La mejora en la traducción considera…\") feel stilted. These issues reduce overall smoothness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\". Consistency is maintained throughout. The word \"prompt\" is left untranslated, which is acceptable in a technical context, though a Spanish equivalent could be offered.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely keeps the original intent and tone, but the insertion of a translator’s note about improving naturalness is out of place and can confuse listeners. Additionally, the register shift between \"Usted\" and \"tú\" affects cultural appropriateness. Overall, the adaptation is decent but not flawless.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present. No major ideas are omitted, and the explanations remain intact. The only drawback is the extra meta‑comment, which does not add to the original content but also does not delete any critical information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and is mostly understandable, but it suffers from occasional unnatural phrasing, inconsistent register, and an unnecessary translator’s note that breaks the dialogue flow. With a few stylistic refinements and removal of out‑of‑context remarks, it would reach a higher level of polish.\nOverall score (out of 100): 82/100.\nOverall rating: Good, but with room for improvement in fluency and cultural adaptation."
