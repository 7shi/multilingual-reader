  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the main ideas are clear. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido **en**” instead of “a”, inconsistent use of “Usted”/“tú”, missing accents) slightly hinder smooth reading, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several expressions are literal or awkward: “Pues mira:”, “Usted ha entendido todo.”, “el afinamiento” (instead of the more common “ajuste fino”), and punctuation issues such as “¡”. These reduce the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, etc. The choice of “afinamiento” for fine‑tuning is acceptable, though “ajuste fino” would be more idiomatic. Overall term handling is consistent and appropriate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone, but cultural adaptation is limited. Formal‑informal register shifts (mix of “Usted” and informal phrasing) and the literal “Hola y bienvenido en” feel out of place for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience. Nevertheless, the purpose and message are preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the content from the French source is present; no significant ideas are omitted or added. Minor stylistic redundancies exist, but the informational load is intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version conveys the original podcast script accurately and retains the technical explanations. While readability and completeness are solid, fluency and cultural adaptation suffer from a few literal renderings and inconsistent register. Technical terminology is well handled, though using more idiomatic equivalents (e.g., “ajuste fino”) would improve the text. Overall, the translation is good but could be polished for a native‑speaker audience.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 16.2 ≈ 16/20.\nRecommendations: revise awkward phrases, harmonize pronoun usage, replace “afinamiento” with “ajuste fino”, and correct minor grammatical errors (prepositions, accents)."
