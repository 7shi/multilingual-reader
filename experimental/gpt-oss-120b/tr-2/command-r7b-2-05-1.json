  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the main ideas are conveyed, but sentence structures are often long and literal, making the flow a bit cumbersome. Some punctuation (excessive exclamation marks) and abrupt shifts affect smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several awkward or ungrammatical constructions (e.g., \"Olvidan todo\", \"Ella leerá\" in future tense, over‑use of exclamation marks, inconsistent gender agreement). The translation also contains a meta‑comment about verb tense that does not belong to the dialogue, breaking naturalness.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"ventana de contexto\" are correctly rendered. The term \"fine‑tuning\" is rendered as \"ajuste\", which is acceptable though \"ajuste fino\" would be clearer. Overall terminology handling is solid.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator generally preserves the original intent, but adds unnecessary explanatory notes (e.g., the imperative‑verb comment) and occasionally uses phrasing that feels forced in Spanish. Cultural adaptation is minimal, which is fine for a technical podcast, but the added commentary detracts from a clean adaptation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the notion of “memory” features. No essential information is omitted, though some sentences are verbose.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the technical content and overall structure of the original French podcast, but its readability and fluency suffer from literal phrasing, occasional grammatical errors, and superfluous meta‑comments. Terminology is mostly accurate, and the information is complete, yet the text would benefit from a more natural, idiomatic rewrite and removal of unnecessary editorial notes to sound like a genuine spoken podcast in Spanish.\nOverall score (out of 100): 72/100."
