  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is understandable, but the insertion of translator’s notes (e.g., “Esta traducción busca mantener la fidelidad…”, “La traducción se ha suavizado…”) inside the dialogue interrupts the flow. The presence of slashes offering alternative phrasings also forces the reader to parse non‑essential information, making the script harder to follow for a typical listener.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnaturally literal renderings and occasional grammatical mismatches (e.g., switching gender from \"ella\" to \"él\", redundant use of \"precisamente\"). The meta‑comments and multiple variant options break the natural conversational tone expected in a podcast script. Overall it sounds stilted rather than fluid.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally well‑handled: \"entrenamiento previo\" for pré‑entraînement, \"ajuste fino\" for fine‑tuning, \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\". The terminology is consistent and appropriate for a non‑specialist audience, though \"entrenamiento previo\" is less common than \"pre‑entrenamiento\".",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent, but the added explanatory notes (“Esta traducción busca…”, “La traducción mejorada es…”) are unnecessary for the target audience and reflect the translator rather than the speakers. Cultural adaptation is fine, but the over‑explanation reduces the impact.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the description of “memory” features. No substantive information is omitted, even if some sentences are cluttered with extra commentary.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the technical content accurately and uses appropriate terminology, but it is marred by excessive translator intrusions, redundant alternatives, and occasional awkward phrasing. For a podcast script intended to be listened to, the meta‑comments would need to be removed and the language smoothed to achieve a natural, engaging flow. As it stands, the text is functional but not polished for native‑speaker consumption.\nOverall score (average of criteria): 14/20."
