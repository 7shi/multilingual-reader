    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation conveys the original ideas clearly and the sentence flow is logical. Most sentences are easy to follow, and the technical concepts are explained in an accessible way. Minor issues such as “en la Internet” instead of the more natural “en Internet” slightly hinder smooth reading, but they do not obstruct comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural for a native Spanish speaker overall. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and the informal register (“Imaginad”, “consultor”) fits a podcast style. Small awkward constructions like “el modelo utiliza simplemente” and the aforementioned “en la Internet” prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated and kept recognizable: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, ventana de contexto, grounding (anclaje), memoria. The occasional retention of the English word “prompt” is acceptable in a technical context. No important term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original tone to Spanish‑speaking listeners, using familiar phrasing and cultural references (e.g., “consultor”). The informal plural imperative matches the French “Imaginez”. Overall, the adaptation preserves the intent and makes the dialogue feel native.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the content from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and the translation does not add irrelevant material. The flow of the conversation is preserved fully.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It faithfully reproduces the original podcast script, maintaining the technical depth while remaining understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor linguistic slips (e.g., \"en la Internet\") prevent it from being flawless, but they are isolated and do not affect the overall message. Terminology is handled expertly, and the adaptation respects the informal, conversational tone of the source.\n\nOverall, the work demonstrates strong competence in both language proficiency and technical translation.\n\nScore: 18/20 (average of the five evaluated criteria)."
