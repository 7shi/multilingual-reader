  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original flow, but there are several awkward constructions (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenido en\", \"es del cramming\") and occasional missing accents that slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many literal renderings and mixed registers (formal \"Usted\" versus informal \"tú\"), as well as unnatural phrases such as \"Usted ha entendido todo\" and \"es del cramming\". These make the prose feel stiff and not fully natural for native speakers.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly correct: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" are well handled. The term \"afinamiento\" is acceptable but less common than \"ajuste fino\". \"grounding\" is left in English, which is permissible but could be explained.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and adapts the examples to Spanish culture, yet the inconsistent register and a few literal translations (e.g., \"consultor brillante\") reduce the naturalness. The overall message is preserved.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the ideas, examples, and explanations from the French source are present. No major content is omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in transmitting the technical content and the dialogue structure, but it suffers from several fluency and readability issues stemming from overly literal phrasing and inconsistent register. Technical terminology is mostly accurate, though some terms could be rendered in more idiomatic Spanish. With a few stylistic revisions, the text would read much more naturally for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\nOverall score (out of 100): 76/100 (average 15.2/20). The translation is good in substance but needs polishing for natural flow and consistency.\n\n**Breakdown**: Readability 15, Fluency 13, Terminology 16, Contextual Adaptation 14, Information Completeness 18.\n**Suggested improvements**: adjust prepositions (\"bienvenido a\"), use consistent pronouns (either \"tú\" or \"usted\"), replace \"es del cramming\" with a Spanish equivalent (\"es como el estudio intensivo\"), and consider using \"ajuste fino\" for \"fine‑tuning\"."
