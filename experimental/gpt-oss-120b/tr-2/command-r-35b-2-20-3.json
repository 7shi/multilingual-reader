  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the technical ideas are explained clearly. Minor hiccups (e.g., a slightly long clarification about \"estudiar con intensidad\") do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but a few expressions are a bit awkward for native speakers: \"aprendizaje basado en transferencia\", \"enraizamiento\" for \"grounding\", and the phrase \"la IA no ha olvidado en el sentido de la palabra humana\". The inconsistency of the podcast name (\"Tech Relámpago\" vs. \"Tech Éclair\") also breaks fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly (pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, transferencia de aprendizaje, ICL). The choice of \"enraizamiento\" for \"grounding\" is uncommon; \"anclaje\" or keeping the English term would be preferable. Overall, terminology is accurate but not always the most idiomatic.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and pedagogical style. Cultural references are appropriate, and the examples remain clear. The only drawback is the inconsistent podcast title, which could confuse Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present; no substantive content is omitted. The only minor issue is the name inconsistency, which does not affect factual completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical concepts accurately and remains largely readable and natural. The main areas for improvement are the consistent use of the podcast name, choosing more idiomatic equivalents for a few technical terms (especially \"grounding\"), and polishing a couple of slightly stiff phrasing. With those tweaks, the translation would be excellent for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
