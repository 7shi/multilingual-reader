  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly clear and the concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can understand. There are a few overly long sentences and occasional redundancy, but overall a Spanish‑speaking reader can grasp the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound literal or awkward (e.g., \"Lenguaje de Modelado de Contexto Grande\", \"aprendizaje basado en situaciones\"). The use of \"usted\" is inconsistent with the informal podcast tone, and some constructions are clunky. Nevertheless, the text is largely understandable and flows reasonably well.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly rendered correctly (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, grounding, memoria). However, the translation of \"large language model\" as \"Lenguaje de Modelado de Contexto Grande\" is non‑standard, and \"aprendizaje basado en situaciones\" does not correspond to the established term \"aprendizaje en contexto\". This inconsistency reduces the precision of the terminology.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast’s intent and tone, and adds a few explanatory phrases that aid comprehension. Cultural references are appropriate, and the overall message is conveyed accurately. Minor issues with formality (use of \"usted\") do not significantly affect the adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are retained. No important segment is omitted, and the added clarifications do not distort the meaning. The only loss is the subtle nuance in the term \"in‑context learning\", which is slightly altered, but the overall information remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original dialogue faithfully and is largely readable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The main weaknesses lie in the handling of specific technical terminology and occasional unnatural phrasing, which can momentarily distract the reader. With minor refinements—especially standardizing terms like \"modelo de lenguaje grande\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\"—the translation would reach a higher level of professional quality.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
