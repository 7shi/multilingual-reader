  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences convey the concepts clearly and the flow of the dialogue is maintained. There are a few minor grammatical slips (e.g., “se lee una cantidad masiva de datos” instead of “lee una cantidad masiva de datos”) that slightly hinder smooth reading, but they do not obstruct comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, but some passages feel overly literal (“Se denomina este enfoque aprendizaje en contexto”, “Los nuevos conocimientos se integran permanentemente a su conocimiento”). These constructions are understandable yet sound a bit stilted to a native speaker. Overall, the language is fluid with occasional awkwardness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, ventana de contexto, etc. The terminology is consistent throughout the text and matches the usual Spanish usage in AI literature. No important term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., “consultor brillante”). Gender agreement with “IA” (feminine) is kept, which is common in Spanish. Minor stylistic improvements could be made, but the overall adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and the dialogue structure is preserved. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy and maintains conciseness.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It faithfully transmits the technical content and conversational tone of the original podcast while using appropriate Spanish terminology. Minor issues with phrasing and occasional literalness prevent it from being perfect, but they do not detract significantly from comprehension or naturalness.\nOverall score: 18/20."
