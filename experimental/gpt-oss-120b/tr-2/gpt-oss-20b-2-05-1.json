  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the concepts are explained clearly. Sentences are generally easy to follow, though the occasional switch between formal \"Usted\" and informal \"tú\" creates a slight disruption for the listener.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, with appropriate verb tenses and idiomatic phrasing. Minor awkwardness appears in phrases like \"Usted ha entendido todo\" (formal in a casual podcast) and a few literal calques such as \"ventana de contexto\" that, while understandable, are not the most common Spanish wording.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, anclaje, etc. The English word \"prompt\" is left unchanged, which is acceptable for a tech‑savvy audience, and overall term usage is consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a friendly podcast, but the inconsistent register (mix of \"Usted\" and \"tú\") and a few overly literal translations slightly reduce cultural resonance for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present; no significant information is omitted or added. The content remains concise while keeping the necessary details.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is very solid: it conveys the technical ideas accurately and is largely readable and fluent. The main areas for improvement are register consistency and polishing a few slightly literal expressions to sound more natural in a casual podcast setting.\n\nThe translation would be well‑understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners interested in AI, but a final editorial pass to harmonise pronouns and fine‑tune idiomatic phrasing would bring it to near‑perfect quality.\n\nScore: 17/20 (average of the five criteria)."
