    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the flow of ideas follows the original. Most sentences convey the intended meaning, and the technical concepts are explained clearly. However, there are several minor grammatical oddities (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en”, “el afinado…”, “apretar para un examen”) that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many literal renderings that sound unnatural to native speakers. Issues include mixed use of \"Usted\" and \"tú\", awkward verb choices (\"se atreviera\", \"apretar para un examen\"), and a few syntactic constructions that are not idiomatic in Spanish. While the meaning is preserved, the overall fluency feels stilted.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje\" are appropriate and consistent. A few minor inconsistencies (\"afinado\" instead of \"afinamiento\") appear, but they do not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and explanatory tone, and it adapts the content for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Nevertheless, certain phrases are overly literal and some cultural nuances are missed (e.g., the opening greeting, the formal/informal register), which reduces the naturalness of the adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No essential points are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue. The translation is complete and faithful to the source content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in conveying the full content and technical detail of the original podcast script. Terminology is largely accurate, and the overall message is preserved. However, the text suffers from several literal translations and stylistic inconsistencies that affect readability and naturalness. A more careful adaptation to Spanish idiom and consistent register would improve the quality significantly.\n\nOverall, the work is solid but needs polishing for fluency and stylistic coherence.\n\nScore: 16/20 (average of the individual criteria)."
