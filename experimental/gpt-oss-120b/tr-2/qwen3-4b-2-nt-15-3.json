  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand. Sentences are mostly logical and the concepts are explained clearly. However, there are a few awkward phrasing issues (e.g., “hola y bienvenido en”, “una antiespia”) that can momentarily disrupt comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally, but several literal translations betray the source language (“es del aprendizaje superficial”, “una antiespia”, “el modelo mismo”). These create slight unnaturalness for native speakers, though they do not impede overall meaning.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)” and “anclaje” are correctly rendered and consistently used. The translation respects the expected terminology for a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The podcast tone is maintained and the translation adapts cultural references appropriately. Minor inconsistencies in register (mix of “tú” and “usted”) and a few unnatural idioms slightly reduce the adaptation quality.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present. No ideas are omitted, and the flow of the dialogue is preserved. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the original content accurately and retains the educational podcast style. Technical terminology is well handled, and the full information is kept intact. The main areas for improvement are smoothing out literal translations and ensuring consistent register throughout the dialogue to achieve a more natural, native‑speaker feel.\n\nStrengths: completeness, correct terminology, clear exposition of concepts.\nWeaknesses: occasional awkward phrasing, mixed formal/informal address, a few literal translations that sound unnatural.\n\nWith minor polishing, the text would read as a fluent, native‑level Spanish podcast script.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 83"
