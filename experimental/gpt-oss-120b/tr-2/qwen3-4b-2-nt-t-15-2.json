  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall understandable; the dialogue flow is preserved and the concepts are explained. However, several sentences are awkward (e.g., “una IA total”, “el aprendizaje en contexto, es del bacotaje”) and some punctuation makes the reading a little stilted. The structure is logical but the occasional grammatical slips slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains numerous non‑native constructions, mixed registers (formal «usted» with informal «tú»), and outright grammatical errors such as “cuando abre una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío”, “Si quiero que ella tenga conocimiento…”, and “cuando usted afinan un modelo”. These issues make the text feel artificial rather than natural to a native speaker.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly retained correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning” → “afinado”, “In‑Context Learning” → “aprendizaje en contexto”, “ventana de contexto”. The word “grounding” is left untranslated, which is acceptable in a technical context, but the translation of “transfer learning” as “aprendizaje por transferencia” is spot‑on. Some inconsistencies (e.g., “afinado” vs the more common “ajuste fino”) prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original podcast are preserved, and the examples are culturally neutral, so the adaptation works. The main drawback is the inconsistent use of pronouns and register, which can feel jarring to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Otherwise, the translation conveys the original purpose well.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the ideas, analogies and details from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No major information is omitted, and the examples (universal graduate, consultant, bike‑riding analogy) are kept. Redundancy is minimal.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the full content and technical depth of the original podcast, but its linguistic quality is hampered by several awkward phrasings, register mismatches, and grammatical mistakes. While a Spanish reader can follow the discussion, a native speaker would notice the non‑natural style. Improving verb agreement, choosing more idiomatic expressions, and keeping a consistent level of formality would raise the fluency considerably.\nOverall, the work is solid in terms of completeness and terminology but needs polishing for readability and naturalness.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 14/20."
