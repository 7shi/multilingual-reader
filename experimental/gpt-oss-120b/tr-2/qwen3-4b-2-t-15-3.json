  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original structure, but several sentences are awkward or contain minor errors (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en”, “aplastar en la víspera”). These affect the flow for a native reader, though the core ideas remain clear.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are multiple unnatural expressions and inconsistencies in register (mix of “usted” and “tú”, odd word choices like “antiespuesta”, “aplastar en la víspera”). The translation sounds slightly stilted and occasionally literal, reducing its naturalness.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto” and the acronym ICL are correctly retained. The translation of “grounding” as “anclaje” is acceptable. Minor missed opportunities to add brief explanations (e.g., for “prompt”) do not significantly harm comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the podcast’s conversational tone and purpose, but some phrasing feels literal and not fully adapted to Spanish‑speaking audiences (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en”, “antiespuesta”). The mix of formal and informal address also creates slight inconsistency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present; no major ideas or sections are omitted. The only minor loss is the nuance of some idiomatic expressions, which does not affect factual content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and retains the technical depth, but it suffers from several fluency and readability issues that make it sound less natural in Spanish. Terminology is well‑handled, and no crucial information is lost, yet the occasional literal renderings and inconsistent register prevent it from being a polished, native‑like version.\nOverall, the translation is functional and informative but would benefit from a thorough linguistic edit to improve naturalness and flow.\nScore: 77/100 (average of the five criteria)."
