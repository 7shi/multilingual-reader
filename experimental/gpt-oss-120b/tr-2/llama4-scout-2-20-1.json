  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the structure of the original dialogue. However, the insertion of meta‑comments (e.g., “Esta traducción busca mantener la fidelidad…”, multiple slash‑separated alternatives) interrupts the flow and can confuse a reader. The core content is clear, but the extra editorial notes reduce smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences are natural, but numerous awkward constructions appear: the slash‑separated alternatives, literal translations such as “ventana de contexto” (acceptable but a bit technical), and occasional overly literal phrasing (“Se puede decir eso.”). The presence of translation notes inside the dialogue makes the text feel artificial for a native speaker.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"transferencia de aprendizaje\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje\", \"prompt\" are all appropriate. Consistency is good, and no major mistranslations are observed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and purpose of the original podcast are preserved, and the language is generally suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Nonetheless, the added editorial comments and alternative phrasings are unnecessary and disrupt the natural adaptation to the target culture.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is retained; no key points are omitted. The translation even adds explanatory notes, which, while redundant, do not remove content. Hence the completeness is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original technical discussion accurately and keeps the core message intact. However, the inclusion of numerous meta‑comments, slash‑separated alternatives, and occasional stiff phrasing detracts from readability and fluency. A cleaner version that removes editorial notes and smooths out the wording would be much more natural for Spanish listeners.\nOverall score: 72/100."
