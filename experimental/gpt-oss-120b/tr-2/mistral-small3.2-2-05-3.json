    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logical and the dialogue flow mirrors the original. Minor issues such as inconsistent naming of the podcast at the very end (\"Tecnología Rápida\" instead of \"Tech Éclair\") and a few missing accents (\"indicacion\") slightly distract the reader, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are a few literal renderings that feel a bit stiff for a native speaker: \"Cuando abres una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío\" (more idiomatic would be \"empiezas con un contexto vacío\"), \"El modelo en sí no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus discusiones\" (\"a partir de\" is less common than \"de\"), and the use of \"indicacion\" without the accent. Overall, the text is smooth but not completely idiomatic.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), y anclaje (grounding). The only slight drawback is the translation of \"prompt\" as \"indicación\", which is understandable but not the most common term in Spanish AI literature (\"prompt\" or \"entrada\" are preferred). Consistency and correctness are otherwise solid.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and maintains the informal podcast tone. Cultural references are preserved, and the analogy of a consultant is clear. The main inconsistency is the change of the podcast name at the closing line, which could confuse listeners. Apart from that, the adaptation is appropriate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and nuances from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No relevant information is omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality: it faithfully reproduces the content, uses correct technical terminology, and is largely readable and natural. Minor stylistic lapses (inconsistent podcast naming, a few literal phrasings, and a missing accent) prevent a perfect score, but the text would be easily understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts."
