  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is cluttered with parenthetical remarks, alternative phrasings and editorial notes (e.g., “alternativa más natural”, “en español de España/Latinoamérica”). These insertions break the flow of the dialogue, making it harder for a reader to follow the conversation. The core ideas are still present, but the added meta‑comments reduce clarity.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most sentences are grammatically correct, the style oscillates between a formal exposition and a conversational podcast script. Phrases such as “Este proceso es fundamental en el aprendizaje de los modelos de IA que utilizamos diariamente” feel overly didactic, and the frequent use of brackets and asterisks creates an unnatural reading experience for native speakers.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding) are generally well‑translated and consistent. Minor inconsistencies appear (e.g., “pre‑entrenamiento” vs. “preentrenamiento”), but the essential terminology is accurate and appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adds many cultural and editorial comments that are not present in the original script (e.g., suggestions about regional variants, notes on naturalness). These meta‑remarks shift the focus away from the original intent—a clear, engaging podcast dialogue—so the adaptation to the target audience is limited.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French dialogue are retained: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the discussion about memory features. No essential information is omitted, though the added commentary sometimes distracts from the core content.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full technical content of the original podcast, but its readability and naturalness are hampered by excessive editorial notes and inconsistent style. Technical terminology is mostly handled well, yet the frequent meta‑annotations make the text feel more like a translation guide than a polished podcast script. To improve the translation, the editor should remove the parenthetical explanations, keep a consistent conversational tone, and ensure terminology is used uniformly throughout.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 64/100."
