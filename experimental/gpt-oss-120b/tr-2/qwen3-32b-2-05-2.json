  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the explanations of abstract concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto) are clear. Minor issues such as occasional long sentences do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but a few literal renderings feel slightly stiff (e.g., \"una IA completamente nueva\", \"consultor a corto plazo\"). The use of guillemets « » is appropriate for Spanish podcasts, yet occasional phrasing could be smoother.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently and correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding (anclaje). No mistranslations or confusing jargon appear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and style of a podcast dialogue. Cultural references are neutral, and the Spanish wording fits the target audience, though a couple of expressions could be more idiomatic (e.g., \"una IA recién creada\" instead of \"completamente nueva\").",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present. No ideas are omitted, and the logical flow is retained. The only loss is a tiny amount of stylistic flourish, which does not affect content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality: it conveys the technical content accurately, remains readable, and largely sounds natural in Spanish. Minor stylistic tweaks would raise fluency, but the work is solid and suitable for a podcast audience.\nOverall rating: 18/20.\n\n**Strengths** – precise terminology, complete information transfer, clear explanations.\n**Weaknesses** – occasional literal phrasing that feels slightly stiff.\n**Recommendation** – a light edit for idiomatic flow would bring the fluency score to the level of the other criteria.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17.8 ≈ 18 out of 20."
