  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and the logical flow of the dialogue is preserved. However, several grammatical slips (e.g., “una IA total”, “las conocimientos”, “partes de un contexto vacío”) and occasional awkward phrasing force the reader to pause, slightly reducing smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound unnatural for a native speaker: “Hola y bienvenido en”, “Imaginaos”, “el aprendizaje en contexto, es del bacotaje”, “sube a la silla”. Verb conjugations and gender agreements are frequently incorrect, which makes the translation feel stilted.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical vocabulary is mostly handled correctly – “preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”. The choice of “afinado” for fine‑tuning is acceptable though less common than “ajuste fino”. Consistency is good, and the key concepts are preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator kept the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue, and cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor idiomatic mismatches (e.g., “sube a la silla” instead of “subes a la bicicleta”) do not alter the overall message.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present; no significant ideas are omitted or distorted. The translation is complete and faithful to the source content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full content and retains the educational intent of the original podcast. Strengths lie in completeness and correct handling of technical terms. Weaknesses are mainly grammatical and stylistic: frequent gender/agreement errors, unnatural verb forms, and some literal renderings that sound odd in Spanish. A careful proofreading and slight re‑phrasing would raise fluency and readability substantially.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
