  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the podcast‑style dialogue is preserved. Even the more abstract concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) are explained clearly, so a Spanish‑speaking listener can understand without extra effort.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for native speakers. Vocabulary and grammar are appropriate, and the conversational tone is kept. Minor hiccups such as \"cuando se comienza una nueva conversación\" (instead of the more idiomatic \"cuando se inicia…\") or the occasional long clause slightly reduce the fluidity.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\". The choice of \"anclaje\" for \"grounding\" is acceptable, though not the most common term, but it remains consistent throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., using \"chuleta\" for \"cheat‑sheet\"). The informal podcast register is retained, and the examples are clear for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Slightly formal phrasing in a couple of places could be more colloquial, but overall the adaptation is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas from the original French script are present. No sentences or nuances are omitted, and the added clarifications (e.g., explaining \"memoria\" features) are faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the original content accurately, keeps the lively podcast tone, and uses appropriate technical language. A few minor phrasing tweaks could make it sound a touch more natural, but the text is fully understandable and faithful to the source.\nOverall score (average): 18.2 → 18/20.\nOverall score is therefore 18 out of 20.\n\nScore: 18"
