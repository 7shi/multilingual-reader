    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and the flow of ideas mirrors the original French script. Listeners can follow the discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning without major confusion. Minor hiccups such as the incorrect abbreviation “AIL” for In‑Context Learning and occasional mixed dialect (“refinás” vs. “refinas”) slightly disrupt smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most of the dialogue, using idiomatic Spanish expressions (e.g., “es como contratar a un consultor brillante”). Nevertheless, a few phrases feel forced or overly literal: “aprenderá el francés a una rapidez impresionante”, “una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje automatizado en contexto”, and the inconsistent use of pronouns (vos/tú). These quirks prevent a fully native‑like fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “anclaje”. The translation preserves the French‑style quoted terms and explains them when needed. The main drawback is the wrong acronym “AIL” instead of the standard ICL (In‑Context Learning), which could mislead technically‑savvy readers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish well, keeping the conversational back‑and‑forth and the analogies (consultant, bike‑riding). Cultural references are neutral and appropriate. The occasional shift between “vos” and “tú” is a minor inconsistency but does not affect overall intent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is retained. No substantive content is omitted, and the examples (English → French learning, memory vs. context) remain intact. The translation adds no unnecessary redundancy and keeps the length comparable to the source.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the original message effectively. It is readable, mostly fluent, and technically accurate, with only a few minor issues (incorrect acronym, slight dialect mixing, occasional literal phrasing). The translator succeeded in preserving the educational tone and the nuanced distinctions between fine‑tuning and in‑context learning, making the podcast script accessible to Spanish‑speaking listeners.\nScore out of 100: 82/100."
