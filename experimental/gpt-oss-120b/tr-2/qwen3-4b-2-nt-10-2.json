    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and the ideas are conveyed in a logical order. Most sentences are easy to follow, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in plain language. A few constructions (e.g., “Usted ha comprendido todo”, “Imagínese que se envía a una IA…”) are slightly stilted, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward or literal renderings that a native speaker would avoid: “Imagínese que se envía a una IA…”, “competencia permanente”, “punto crucial que a menudo se entiende mal”, and spacing before punctuation marks. Vocabulary is appropriate, yet the flow could be smoother.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (Aprendizaje en contexto)”, and “fine‑tuning” are either correctly translated or kept in the original with a helpful parenthetical explanation. The term “prompt” is left untranslated, which is acceptable for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Formal “Usted” is used consistently, matching a neutral Spanish audience. Some idiomatic adjustments could improve cultural resonance, but overall the adaptation is faithful.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present. No major ideas are omitted, and the nuanced distinction between temporary context learning and permanent fine‑tuning is retained. Minor redundancies are avoided.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. Readability and terminology are strong points, while fluency suffers from a few literal phrases that feel unnatural in Spanish. Minor stylistic refinements would bring the text to a native‑speaker level of polish.\n\nScore breakdown: readability 16, fluency 15, terminology 18, contextual adaptation 16, information completeness 19. The average yields an overall score of 17/20.\n\nThe translation would benefit from smoothing out the few awkward constructions and adopting more idiomatic Spanish expressions, but it succeeds in delivering the podcast’s educational message clearly and correctly.\n\nOverall score (out of 20): 17"
