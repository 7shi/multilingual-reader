  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear order. Sentences are mostly short and easy to follow, making the technical discussion accessible to a broad audience. A few constructions are slightly word‑y (e.g., “Este proceso de aprendizaje inicia con un procedimiento…”) but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, using idiomatic Spanish. Some literal renderings (“ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”) feel a bit redundant, and a couple of phrases are slightly stilted, but overall a native speaker would find it comfortable.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently handled: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, anclaje, memoria. The choice of “anclaje” for “grounding” is appropriate, and no important term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural elements well, e.g., rendering the podcast title as “Tech Relámpago”. The style matches a conversational podcast script and respects Spanish‑speaking listeners’ expectations.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the content of the original script is retained. No key idea is omitted, and the explanation of “memoria” features is preserved. The translation is as complete as the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the original message effectively. It is readable and mostly fluent, with appropriate handling of technical terminology and good cultural adaptation. Minor literalness and occasional clunky phrasing keep the score just shy of perfect, but the quality is high and suitable for a Spanish‑language podcast audience.\n\nScore (out of 100): 91"
