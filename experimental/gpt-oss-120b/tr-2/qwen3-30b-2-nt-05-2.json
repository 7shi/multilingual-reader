  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the ideas are easy to follow. Sentences are not overly long, and the dialogue format is preserved. Minor typographic choices (e.g., “pre‑entrenamiento” vs. the more common “preentrenamiento”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Word order and verb choices are appropriate, and idiomatic expressions are used (e.g., “consultor brillante”). A few constructions feel slightly literal (“memoria de corto plazo”, “en secreto”) but they are still understandable.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning” (kept in English), “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”. The translation of “grounding” as “fundamentación” is not the most common Spanish term (\"anclaje\" would be closer), and keeping “fine‑tuning” in English could be confusing for non‑technical readers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator maintains the original intent and tone of a podcast conversation. Cultural references are neutral, and the examples (e.g., “consultor brillante”) are appropriate for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Some phrasing is a direct carry‑over from French (e.g., \"memoria de corto plazo\") but does not distort meaning.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “Memoria” features. No significant information is omitted.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical concepts clearly, reads smoothly, and preserves the conversational style of the podcast. Minor issues with terminology consistency and a few slightly literal phrasings prevent a perfect score, but the translation is fully functional for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI topics.\n\nStrengths: clear structure, faithful content, natural dialogue. Areas for improvement: unify technical vocabulary (e.g., use \"ajuste fino\" instead of keeping the English term) and choose the most common Spanish equivalents for specialized words like \"grounding\".\n\nScore: 87/100."
