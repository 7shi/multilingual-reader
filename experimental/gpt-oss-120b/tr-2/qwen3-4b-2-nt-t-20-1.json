  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall easy to follow and the ideas are clearly presented. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., “bienvenido **en**” instead of “bienvenido **a**”, mixed use of “Usted” and “tú”) slightly hinder smooth reading, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several sentences are literal translations that feel awkward to a native speaker: “Usted ha entendido todo”, “Esta aproximación se llama aprendizaje en contexto, o Aprendizaje en Contexto (ICL)”, and occasional punctuation errors. The register shifts between formal and informal, which reduces fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered (“preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL”). The decision to keep “grounding” untranslated is acceptable in a tech‑focused podcast, and the terminology is used consistently throughout.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral, so no major adaptation is needed. The main drawback is the inconsistent pronoun choice (formal vs. informal) which slightly affects the perceived audience alignment.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No relevant details are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original. Redundancies are minimal and do not affect clarity.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the content accurately and retains the educational tone of the original podcast. While the terminology and completeness are strong, readability and fluency suffer from a few literal renderings, punctuation issues, and inconsistent use of formal/informal pronouns. With minor editorial polishing, the text would read as a smooth, native‑speaker‑level podcast script.\nOverall score (average): 16/20."
