    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and the flow of the conversation is preserved. However, a few sentences are awkward (e.g., “El AI”, “Se le olvida todo”) and a key explanatory sentence about the conversation history is omitted, which can momentarily confuse the reader. The overall comprehension is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several non‑native constructions and typographical errors: *ancraje* instead of *anclaje*, *afinar al IA* (gender agreement), *afinado* for *afinamiento*, and occasional missing articles. These make the text sound a bit stilted for a native speaker.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are not consistently handled. The most serious error is the mistranslation of ICL (In‑Context Learning) as “aprendizaje de idiomas asistido por computadora”. Other terms such as “grounding”, “fine‑tuning” and “window of context” are rendered inconsistently (e.g., “afinar”, “afilado”). This reduces the precision of the technical language.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly conveys the original intent, but the omission of the sentence that explains why a new chat window loses the conversation context changes the nuance. The brand name is changed to “Tech Iluminación” in the intro, which is unnecessary, though later it is restored. Cultural references are fine.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Important information is lost: the sentence describing that the whole previous discussion constitutes the context is replaced by an unrelated line, and the ICL definition is incorrect. These omissions affect the completeness of the technical explanation.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation captures the spirit of the podcast and most of the content, but it suffers from several notable inaccuracies. The most critical problems are the wrong rendering of the ICL concept and the missing explanation about conversation context, plus a handful of lexical and grammatical slips. With careful proofreading and correction of the technical terms, the translation could reach a much higher quality level."
