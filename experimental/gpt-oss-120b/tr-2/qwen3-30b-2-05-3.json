    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the sentences flow logically. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained in simple language that a non‑expert can grasp. A few minor phrasing choices (e.g., “afinado” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”) do not hinder comprehension, but they slightly affect smoothness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural for a conversational podcast. Most idiomatic expressions are well rendered (e.g., “como contratar a un consultor brillante”). There are occasional awkward turns – “estudia de memoria” for “cramming”, “ventana de contexto” (acceptable but less common than “ventana de contexto”) and the use of “afinado” – but they do not break the flow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly translated: “preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “ventana de contexto”. The term “grounding” is rendered as “anclaje”, which is understandable but not the most usual translation in the AI community (\"anclaje\" is acceptable but \"fundamentación\" or keeping the English word is more common). Consistency is maintained throughout the script.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the informal, friendly tone of the original French podcast to Spanish, using familiar colloquialisms (“¡Lo has comprendido todo!”, “Se podría decir eso.”). Cultural references are neutral, so no mis‑alignment appears. The adaptation preserves the original intent and makes the dialogue feel natural for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is retained. No sentences are omitted or altered in meaning. The Spanish version includes the same examples, analogies, and explanations, keeping the content complete and accurate.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the original content faithfully, maintains the conversational style, and is largely readable and fluent. Minor issues are limited to a few lexical choices that could be refined (e.g., using \"ajuste fino\" instead of \"afinado\" and perhaps a different rendering of \"grounding\"). These do not significantly detract from the overall effectiveness of the translation. The work scores very well across all criteria, reflecting a solid and competent rendering of the French podcast into Spanish."
