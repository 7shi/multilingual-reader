  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the concepts are explained clearly. However, a few sentences (e.g., Camille’s meta‑question about the episode) are awkwardly constructed and can momentarily confuse the reader.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, using idiomatic Spanish. There are occasional clunky turns (e.g., “Permítanme aclarar; en este episodio estamos hablando…”) and a few minor grammatical slips, but overall the flow is good.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje de transferencia”, “ventana de contexto” and “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)” are correctly rendered. The word “ancraje” is a misspelling of the correct “anclaje”, and the English loanword “prompt” is left untranslated without explanation, which slightly harms consistency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish‑speaking listeners and keeps cultural neutrality. Minor issues like the misspelled term and the added, slightly off‑topic clarification by Camille reduce the perfect adaptation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the “memory” feature. A few superfluous clarifications were inserted, but no essential information is lost.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core content accurately and is largely readable and natural for Spanish speakers. Small lexical errors (e.g., “ancraje”) and occasional awkward phrasing prevent it from being flawless, but the technical discussion remains clear and complete. Overall, it is a solid translation with room for polishing of terminology and sentence flow.\nOverall Score: 15/20."
