  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand. The main ideas and technical explanations are conveyed clearly, and the sentence flow follows the original. Minor typographical errors (e.g., \"rep aprender\", \"conocencias\") do not block comprehension, but they slightly reduce smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several awkward constructions and grammatical slips: \"Hola y bienvenido en\" (should be \"a\"), \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es del aprendizaje a partir del contexto\", mismatched gender in \"Las nuevas conocimientos\", and the use of \"Usted\" mixed with informal registers. These make the text feel less natural to a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well‑handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" are kept correctly. However, some terminology errors appear, such as \"conocencias\" instead of \"conocimientos\" and the typo \"rep aprender\" for \"reaprender\". The translation of \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\" is acceptable.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and adapts the discourse for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The use of \"Usted\" adds a formal tone that matches the original French \"vous\". Minor cultural tweaks are not required, and the overall message is maintained.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the structure mirrors the source. The only issues are minor redundancies and the occasional typo, which do not affect completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation does a solid job of conveying the technical content and the conversational tone of the podcast. It is mostly complete and understandable, but a few typographical and grammatical errors, as well as some awkward phrasing, prevent it from reaching a fully native‑like fluency. A light editorial pass would raise the quality considerably.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 16/20.\n\nScore: 16"
