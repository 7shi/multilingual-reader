    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logical and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor issues such as the duplicated speaker label (\"Camille: Camille:\") and a small typo (“después del preentrenado” instead of “preentrenamiento”) slightly affect smooth reading, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and the style matches a podcast script. There are a few awkward phrasings (e.g., \"anclaje a la realidad\" is not the usual rendering of *grounding*, \"preentrenado\" as a noun, and some heavy use of bold/italic markers that feel editorial rather than spoken). These quirks lower fluency slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, etc. The translator adds short explanations where needed, which helps the target audience. The only lapse is the misuse of \"preentrenado\" as a noun, but overall terminology handling is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original tone to Spanish listeners, using a friendly opening (\"¡Hola y bienvenidos!\") and maintaining the podcast‑like conversational flow. Cultural references are neutral, and the content is presented in a way that Spanish‑speaking listeners will find familiar. Minor formatting repetitions do not affect the adaptation quality.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is preserved. No key ideas, examples, or analogies are omitted. The only noticeable artifact is the duplicated speaker label, which is a presentation error rather than a loss of content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, remains readable, and adapts well to a Spanish‑speaking audience. The main shortcomings are a few typographical and stylistic slips (duplicated labels, minor lexical choices) that prevent it from being flawless, but they do not detract from the overall understanding.\nScore (average of the five criteria): 17.4 ≈ 17/20."
