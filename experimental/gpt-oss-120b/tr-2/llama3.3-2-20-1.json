    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow; sentences are logical and the technical ideas are explained clearly. The only hiccup is the line \"¿Es decir? or ¿Qué quieres decir?\" which mixes languages and adds unnecessary confusion, slightly hurting smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places and uses appropriate colloquial Spanish. A few constructions feel a bit stiff or oddly literal (e.g., the mixed‑language \"or\", \"enraizamiento\" for grounding, and the parenthetical note about the podcast name). These do not break understanding but prevent the text from sounding completely native.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are correctly rendered and consistently used. The translation of \"grounding\" as \"anclaje (enraizamiento)\" is acceptable, though \"anclaje\" alone would be more common. Overall the terminology is well handled.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately. The only slight mismatch is the handling of the podcast title at the end – switching to \"Tecnología Iluminadora\" while also mentioning the original name creates a minor inconsistency. Otherwise the adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No key ideas are omitted. The extra \"or ¿Qué quieres decir?\" is an unnecessary addition rather than an omission, so completeness remains high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is of high quality: it conveys the technical content accurately and is mostly easy to read for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor issues—such as a mixed‑language phrase, a slightly odd word choice for \"grounding\", and inconsistent handling of the podcast name—prevent a perfect score but do not impede understanding. The translator did a commendable job preserving nuance while rendering the dialogue naturally."
