    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable. The flow of ideas mirrors the original, and the technical concepts are explained clearly. Minor issues such as occasional awkward phrasing and a few grammatical slips (e.g., gender agreement errors) slightly hinder smooth comprehension, but a native reader can follow the discussion without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural: \"Hola y bienvenido en\" should be \"Hola y bienvenido a\"; \"el afinado\" is a literal calque that is not idiomatic Spanish (\"ajuste fino\" is preferred). There are punctuation problems (unnecessary spaces before punctuation) and gender mismatches (\"las conocimientos\"). These affect the naturalness, though the overall text remains readable.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved and correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje, etc. The term \"afinado\" is a literal translation of \"fine‑tuning\"; while understandable, the more common Spanish term would be \"ajuste fino\". Overall, terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone of a podcast conversation. However, some phrases are not culturally adapted to Spanish (e.g., the opening greeting, mixed use of \"usted\" and \"tú\"). A few idiomatic improvements would make the text feel more native, but the core message is retained.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and no extraneous content is added. The translation is faithful to the source material.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and conveys the full content of the original podcast script. It is generally readable and technically correct, but suffers from several stylistic and grammatical issues that reduce its naturalness. Minor lexical adjustments (e.g., \"ajuste fino\" instead of \"el afinado\") and polishing of punctuation and gender agreement would bring the text to a higher quality level.\nOverall score reflects a solid but not flawless rendering of the source material.\nScore out of 20: 16\n"
