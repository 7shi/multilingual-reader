    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and conveys the main ideas. However, there are several awkward phrasings (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en”, “Entendido todo.”) and occasional mismatches in prepositions that slightly hinder smooth comprehension. The sentence structure is mostly logical, but a few constructions feel stilted, requiring a second read for full clarity.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many expressions that do not sound natural to native speakers. Loan‑words such as “antisèche” remain untranslated, the use of “bachotaje” is uncommon, and several sentences are overly literal (“el podcast donde nosotros deciframos”). These issues break the flow, making the text feel mechanical rather than conversational.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “anclaje”. The occasional retention of French tags (e.g., «pré‑entraînement», «fine‑tuning») is acceptable in a bilingual technical context, but a consistent Spanish rendering would be preferable. Overall, terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone, but it does not fully adapt culturally. The use of French terms and the untranslated “antisèche” shows a lack of localization for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Minor adjustments (e.g., “chuleta” instead of “antisèche”) would make the content feel more natural for the target culture.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No significant ideas are omitted, and the logical progression of the discussion is preserved. The translation is faithful to the source content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation faithfully transmits the original content and correctly uses most technical vocabulary. Nonetheless, readability and fluency suffer from literal renderings, occasional untranslated loan‑words, and non‑idiomatic phrasing. Improving these areas would raise the naturalness of the text for Spanish listeners while preserving the technical accuracy already achieved.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20.\n\nScore: 15"
