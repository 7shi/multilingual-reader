  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but it contains many editorial notes, parenthetical alternatives and leftover English fragments (e.g., “engager un consultant brillant”). These interruptions break the flow and make the reading experience less smooth, especially for a listener‑oriented script.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural or overly literal (“El preentrenamiento (o, alternativamente, *preentrenado*…)”, “¡Gracias por escucharnos y hasta el próximo episodio de **« **Tecno Destello** »**!”). The mixture of formatting symbols, asterisks and English words detracts from native‑speaker fluency.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly translated: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, memoria de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (AEC). The occasional retention of English abbreviations (fine‑tuning) is minor, and overall terminology is consistent and appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and purpose, and the podcast name is adapted to “Tecno Destello”. However, the presence of meta‑comments and untranslated placeholders reduces cultural and stylistic adaptation, making the text feel more like a draft than a polished script.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French script is present; no major ideas are omitted. The only drawback is the added noise (alternative suggestions, formatting marks) that does not add value and slightly clouds the content.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately, but it is cluttered with editorial notes, mixed‑language fragments, and occasional awkward phrasing. A thorough clean‑up—removing placeholders, fixing the few literal renderings, and smoothing the prose—would greatly improve readability and fluency, turning it into a polished podcast script for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\nOverall score (out of 100): 65/100."
