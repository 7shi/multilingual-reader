  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows logically and the concepts are explained clearly. Sentences are mostly well‑structured, making it easy for a Spanish‑speaking audience to follow the discussion about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning. Minor hiccups (e.g., occasional formal “Usted” vs. informal “tú”) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are a few typographical/grammatical slips: \"el ajuste fina\" (should be \"ajuste fino\"), inconsistent use of \"Usted\"/\"tú\", and a slightly odd choice of \"fundamentación\" for \"grounding\". These imperfections prevent a perfect native‑like fluency.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are all correctly rendered. The translation of \"grounding\" as \"fundamentación\" is acceptable, though \"anclaje\" might be more common; the meaning is preserved. Consistency is maintained across the dialogue.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts expressions appropriately for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Cultural references (e.g., comparing the model to a consultant) are kept intact. Minor issues such as the word \"trampa\" for \"cheat‑sheet\" could be misread, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the explanations remain as detailed as the original. Redundancies are not introduced, keeping the dialogue concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is very strong, conveying the technical discussion clearly and accurately. Minor typographical errors and a few lexical choices prevent a flawless rating, but they do not obscure meaning. With a quick proof‑read to fix \"ajuste fina\" and harmonize the pronoun register, the text would read like a native‑crafted podcast script.\n\nOverall score: 94/100."
