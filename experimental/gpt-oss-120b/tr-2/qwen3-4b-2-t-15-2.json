  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas are easy to follow. Most sentences convey the original meaning, and the structure is logical. Minor issues such as \"¡Hola y bienvenido en\" (should be \"a\") and a few overly long sentences slightly hinder fluid reading, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several awkward or non‑idiomatic expressions: \"bienvenido en\", \"antiespuesta\" for \"cheat sheet\", and occasional missing accents or article mismatches. Overall the translation sounds like a literal rendering rather than a native‑speaker narration, which makes it feel a bit stiff.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, transferencia de aprendizaje, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding, memoria) are mostly preserved or correctly translated, which is appropriate for a tech‑savvy audience. The only notable misstep is the translation of \"cheat sheet\" as \"antiespuesta\", which is not a recognized term in Spanish.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone of a podcast script. Cultural adaptation is mostly adequate, though the opening greeting should be \"bienvenido a\". The mis‑translation of \"cheat sheet\" and a few literal phrasings reduce the natural cultural fit slightly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present. No sections are omitted, and the logical flow of the discussion is maintained. The only minor loss is the nuance of \"cheat sheet\", but the overall content remains complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the technical content accurately and retains the structure of the original podcast script. It is readable and mostly fluent, but it suffers from a few non‑native constructions and a notable mis‑translation of the term \"cheat sheet\". With minor revisions to idiomatic phrasing and the problematic term, the translation would reach a high level of naturalness and precision.\nOverall rating (average of the five criteria): 16/20."
