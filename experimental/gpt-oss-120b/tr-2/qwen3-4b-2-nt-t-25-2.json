    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and conveys the original ideas. However, there are several grammatical slips (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenido en\", \"las conocencias\", mixed use of \"Usted\"/\"tú\") that can momentarily confuse the reader. Sentence structure is mostly logical, but occasional awkward constructions reduce smoothness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains a number of unnatural expressions and register inconsistencies. Phrases such as \"Usted ha entendido todo\", \"Es del aprendizaje a partir del contexto\" and the misuse of \"conocencias\" break the natural flow. While most vocabulary is appropriate, the overall text does not read as a native‑speaker podcast script.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly rendered (preentrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, memoria). The occasional wrong word (\"conocencias\") and the interchangeable use of \"ajuste fino\"/\"afinado\" cause minor inconsistency, but the specialist terminology is mostly accurate.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone of a conversational podcast, but the shift between formal \"Usted\" and informal \"tú\" feels off for the target audience. Some expressions could be better localized for a Spanish‑speaking listener (e.g., \"bienvenido a\" instead of \"bienvenido en\"). Overall the context is preserved, but cultural‑linguistic fine‑tuning is needed.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the content remains faithful to the original. Minor redundancy and phrasing issues do not affect completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the content and technical concepts well, but it suffers from several linguistic inaccuracies, inconsistent register, and occasional unnatural phrasing. A revision focusing on correct Spanish idiom, consistent pronoun use, and fixing lexical errors (e.g., \"conocencias\") would raise the fluency and readability significantly. The technical terminology is largely on point, and the information is complete, making the text a solid foundation that just needs polishing for native‑speaker quality."
