  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and the flow of ideas follows the original. Listeners can understand the discussion of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning without major confusion. A few sentences are long and could be broken up, but overall comprehension is good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural, but there are several awkward lexical choices: *pre‑capacitación* (the usual term is *pre‑entrenamiento*), *aprendizaje puntual* for “cramming”, and *una gran cantidad considerablemente menor* which is clumsy. These do not break understanding but make the text feel slightly stilted for a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally handled well – *in‑context learning (ICL)*, *ventana de contexto*, *grounding* are kept or explained. However, the translation of *pre‑training* as *pre‑capacitación* is non‑standard, and *fine‑tuning* is rendered as *ajuste fino o la optimización*, mixing two concepts. Consistency could be improved.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue, using appropriate Spanish discourse markers. Cultural adaptation is fine; the examples (e.g., consulting analogy) work equally in Spanish. Minor phrasing issues do not affect the overall message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present: the distinction between temporary knowledge from prompts and permanent knowledge from fine‑tuning, the role of memory features, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. No substantive information is omitted.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation conveys the content accurately and maintains the conversational style of the podcast. It is readable and complete, but a few lexical choices (especially for pre‑training and ‘cramming’) feel unnatural, and technical terminology could be more consistent. Minor edits would bring the text to a more native‑like level, but as it stands it is a solid translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nStrengths: completeness, clear explanation of complex ideas, good preservation of tone.\nWeaknesses: non‑standard terms (*pre‑capacitación*, *aprendizaje puntual*), occasional clumsy phrasing, inconsistency in translating fine‑tuning.\n\nWith a quick proofreading pass to replace the non‑standard terms and smooth out the longer sentences, the translation would be near‑perfect.\n\nScore (out of 100): 82"
