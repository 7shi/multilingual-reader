  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to understand. Sentences convey the original ideas clearly and the logical flow is maintained. A few sentences are long, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native speaker overall. Most expressions are idiomatic, but there are occasional awkward constructions (e.g., “ventana de contexto” para referirse a la memoria a corto‑plazo, mezcla de formal‑informal) and slight redundancy that prevent a perfect fluency rating.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered (preentrenamiento, afinamiento/ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding). The only inconsistency is the alternation between “afinamiento” and “ajuste fino”, which could confuse readers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone well to Spanish, using an informal “tú” that fits the medium. Cultural references are preserved and the intent of the original is fully conveyed. The shift from formal French to informal Spanish is acceptable for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original script is present. No significant details are omitted, and the translation does not add unrelated content. The meaning is preserved throughout.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall the translation is of high quality. It faithfully transmits the technical content and the conversational style of the podcast, while keeping the text readable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor issues with consistency of terminology and occasional slightly clunky phrasing keep it from being perfect, but the work is solid and suitable for publication.\n\nStrengths: accurate terminology, complete information, good adaptation to the podcast format.\nWeaknesses: occasional inconsistency in term choice (afinamiento vs ajuste fino) and a few sentences that could be smoother.\n\nThe translation would only need minimal polishing to reach an excellent level.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
