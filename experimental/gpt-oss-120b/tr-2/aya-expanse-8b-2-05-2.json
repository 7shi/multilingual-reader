  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the podcast’s explanatory style is preserved. Minor issues are long sentences that could be split for easier reading, but overall a Spanish‑speaking audience can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker. Punctuation with opening exclamation marks is correct, and the informal tone matches the original. A few phrasing choices are slightly stiff (e.g., “expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo” instead of “expansión de la ventana de contexto”), but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are rendered appropriately: pre‑training → preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning → ajuste fino, transfer learning → aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL → aprendizaje en contexto, grounding → anclaje, etc. The terms are used consistently and are the standard Spanish equivalents used in AI literature.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and podcast format, using Spanish‑style greetings and exclamations. Cultural references are neutral, so no awkwardness appears. The slight change from “consultant brilliant” to “consultor experto” is acceptable and even clearer for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All ideas, examples, and analogies from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is omitted, and no extra unrelated material is added. The content remains faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical concepts accurately, maintains the conversational podcast tone, and is easily understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve flow, but the translation succeeds in delivering a clear, natural, and complete rendering of the original French script."
