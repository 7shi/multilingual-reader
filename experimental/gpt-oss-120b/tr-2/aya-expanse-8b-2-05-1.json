    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the dialogue flow mirrors the original. A few sentences are a bit long or slightly literal (e.g., “El preentrenamiento.” as a standalone line), but they do not impede comprehension. Overall a native Spanish speaker would understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, using appropriate colloquial expressions (\"¡Saludos y bienvenidos!\", \"consultor brillante\"). Some passages feel slightly forced or overly literal (e.g., \"Inserta automáticamente estos extractos en la solicitud, detrás de escena\"), and the exclamation‑heavy punctuation is a bit uncommon in Spanish podcasts, but these issues are minor.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely well handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\". The main flaw is the acronym change from ICL (In‑Context Learning) to LCI, which could confuse readers familiar with the standard term. Otherwise, the terminology is consistent and appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts cultural references appropriately. The tone remains conversational and suitable for a podcast. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., using \"consultor\" instead of \"consultant\") fit Spanish usage. No cultural missteps are observed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas, examples, and analogies from the French script are retained. No significant information is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The only tiny loss is the subtle nuance of \"expansion massive\" which is correctly rendered as \"expansión masiva\".",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation from French to Spanish is solid and conveys the technical discussion clearly. Readability and contextual adaptation are strong, and the majority of terminology is accurate. The main drawback is the incorrect acronym change (ICL → LCI) and a few slightly literal phrasings that affect fluency. With a quick correction of the acronym and minor stylistic polishing, the text would be near‑perfect for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience."
