  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally easy to follow and conveys the main ideas. However, several sentences are overly long or contain redundant phrasing (e.g., “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL en inglés), o aprendizaje en contexto en español”). Minor punctuation issues (exclamation marks, capitalization) also slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds mostly natural, but there are occasional awkward constructions (“¡el aprendizaje en contexto en acción!”, “Entonces, ¿es una estrategia?”) and literal translations that feel stilted. Vocabulary is appropriate, yet the flow could be smoother.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved, but there are notable errors: “ancraje” is used instead of the correct “anclaje”, and the English word “prompt” is left untranslated. Other terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, and “ventana de contexto” are correctly rendered.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone, but it sometimes mirrors the French syntax rather than adapting to Spanish discourse conventions. Cultural references are minimal, which is acceptable for a technical podcast, yet the occasional literal rendering reduces natural adaptation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present. No major ideas are omitted, and the added clarifications do not distort the original meaning. Redundancies are few and do not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation conveys the technical content accurately and is understandable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Strengths include faithful transmission of the core concepts and a generally clear structure. Weaknesses lie in occasional unnatural phrasing, a couple of terminology errors, and minor readability hiccups. With a few edits—especially correcting \"ancraje\" to \"anclaje\" and smoothing out the longer sentences—the text would reach a higher level of polish.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
