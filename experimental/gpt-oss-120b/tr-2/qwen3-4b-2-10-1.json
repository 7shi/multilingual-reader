    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and the ideas are clearly presented. Most sentences keep the logical flow of the original, and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto) are understandable. However, there are a few awkward constructions such as \"en la internet\" and occasional long sentences that slightly hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several minor grammatical slips and inconsistencies in register (e.g., \"Usted ha entendido todo\" vs. the more informal \"Has entendido\" used elsewhere). The phrase \"en la internet\" is unidiomatic, and there are occasional misplaced commas and agreement errors (\"Las conocimientos\"). These issues prevent the text from feeling completely fluent to a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are correctly rendered and kept consistent throughout. The English word \"prompt\" is retained, which is acceptable in this technical context. Overall the terminology is accurate and appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and educational purpose of the podcast. Cultural references are neutral, and the examples (consultor brillante, aprender a montar en bicicleta) translate well. Minor issues like the unidiomatic \"en la internet\" slightly reduce the cultural adaptation, but the overall message remains intact.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No important points are omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue. Minor stylistic redundancies appear (e.g., repeated explanations of \"memoria a corto plazo\"), but they do not affect completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content clearly. It succeeds in keeping the educational tone of the podcast and uses appropriate terminology. The main drawbacks are a handful of unidiomatic phrases and minor grammatical errors that affect fluency and readability. With a quick proofread to fix these issues, the text would be near‑native quality.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 85/100."
