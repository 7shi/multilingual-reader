  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly logical and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor punctuation errors (e.g., misplaced question mark) and a few awkward constructions slightly reduce smoothness, but a native reader can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several unnatural phrases and typographical errors: \"el afinamiento... es ahí donde entra en juego el «aprendizaje por transferencia» ?\" (question‑mark placement), the misspelling \"crammar\" which is not Spanish, and occasional literal renderings such as keeping \"prompt\" unchanged. These issues make the text feel a bit stilted for a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"grounding\" rendered as \"anclaje\". However, \"fine‑tuning\" is left in English instead of the more common Spanish \"ajuste fino\", and other English borrowings (e.g., \"prompt\", \"ICL\") are kept without explanation, which may confuse less‑technical readers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The informal podcast tone is preserved and cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The translation keeps the conversational style and uses suitable interjections (¡Exactamente!). The only drawback is the unexplained \"crammar\" typo, which could be puzzling. Overall, the adaptation conveys the original intent well.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the ideas, examples, and nuances from the French original are present in the Spanish version. No major information is omitted, and the structure mirrors the source. Minor punctuation and typographical glitches do not affect the completeness of the conveyed information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original podcast script accurately and maintains the informal, explanatory tone. Readability and completeness are strong points. Fluency and terminology could be improved by correcting typographical errors, adjusting punctuation, and translating a few remaining English technical terms into their standard Spanish equivalents. With those refinements, the text would feel fully natural to native Spanish speakers.\n\nOverall score (out of 100): 80"
