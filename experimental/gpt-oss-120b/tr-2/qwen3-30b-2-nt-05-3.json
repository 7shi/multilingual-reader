  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version flows logically and the ideas are presented in a clear order. Complex concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning and aprendizaje en contexto are explained in simple sentences that a non‑expert listener can follow. Minor punctuation quirks (e.g., occasional missing commas) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the text sounds natural to a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. A few phrases feel slightly literal (“Ustedes han comprendido todo”, “una antisèche”), which a native speaker might phrase differently, but they do not break fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”. The English terms are kept in parentheses when useful, preserving the original jargon while giving a clear Spanish equivalent.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the podcast tone to Spanish, using familiar expressions (e.g., “consultor brillante”). Some literal renderings (“una antisèche”) could be replaced by more common Spanish words like “una hoja de referencia”, but the intent and cultural relevance are maintained.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original script is present: the distinction between pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, and the explanation of “memoria” features. No significant details are omitted or added unnecessarily.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is very good. It conveys the technical content accurately and remains easy to understand for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve naturalness, but they do not affect the overall quality. The translator has handled terminology consistently and kept the original message intact.\n\nOverall rating: 18/20."
