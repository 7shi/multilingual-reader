  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the sentences are logically ordered. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained clearly. A few minor hiccups (e.g., mixing French \"Bonjour\" with Spanish) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural, but there are several gender mismatches (\"Exacta\" instead of \"Exacto\"), inconsistent pronoun use (\"tus\" vs. \"vuestras\"), and occasional literal constructions (\"Pensemos que enviamos\" instead of \"Imaginemos\"). These issues make the prose feel slightly awkward for a native speaker.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\". The translation of \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\" is acceptable and consistent throughout. No important term is mistranslated.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original podcast tone and keeps the brand name \"Tech Éclair\" unchanged, which is appropriate. Cultural references are adapted smoothly for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only minor drawback is the retained French greeting, which could feel out‑of‑place, but it does not distort the intended message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No ideas are omitted, and the flow of the conversation is preserved. The translation even adds clarifying commas in a few places, which helps readability without altering meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately. Readability and terminology are strong, and the information is complete. Fluency suffers from a handful of gender and pronoun inconsistencies, and the occasional literal phrasing reduces naturalness. Minor stylistic tweaks would bring the text to a near‑perfect level.\nOverall Score: 91/100"
