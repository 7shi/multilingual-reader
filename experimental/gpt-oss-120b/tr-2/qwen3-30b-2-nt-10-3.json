    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the dialogue flow mirrors the original French. Minor issues such as occasional long sentences do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part, but there are a few awkward expressions (e.g., “pre‑entrenamiento” with a hyphen, “una hoja de resumen justo antes de que comience a hablar con usted”). Vocabulary is appropriate, yet a couple of constructions could be smoother for native speakers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL). The translation keeps the English acronym ICL, which is acceptable. The choice of “anclaje (fundamentación)” for “grounding” is understandable, though “anclaje” alone would suffice. Consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts the podcast tone effectively, using informal salutations and conversational language that fit Spanish‑speaking audiences. Cultural references are neutral, and the intent of the original dialogue is fully preserved.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary redundancy. The technical explanations remain intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the original message accurately, maintains the educational tone of the podcast, and handles technical terminology well. Minor fluency hiccups prevent it from being perfect, but they do not affect the listener’s understanding. The work demonstrates strong competence in both linguistic and domain‑specific translation.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 18/20."
