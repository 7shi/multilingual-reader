  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured, and complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) are explained in a way that a non‑specialist listener can understand. Minor hiccups (e.g., the parenthetical “enraizamiento” after “anclaje”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural for a native‑speaker podcast script. Vocabulary is appropriate and idiomatic overall, though a couple of phrases feel slightly forced (“memoria a corto plazo de la IA, o la ventana de contexto”, “hoja de trucos”). These do not break fluency but prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “Aprendizaje en Contexto (ICL)”. The only slight inconsistency is the translation of “grounding” as “anclaje (enraizamiento)”; “anclaje” alone would be sufficient, but the meaning is still clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original podcast tone, uses culturally appropriate equivalents (e.g., “consultor brillante”, “hoja de trucos”), and adapts examples to Spanish‑speaking listeners without losing intent. The style remains engaging and informative.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present: the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No substantive information is omitted.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, maintains the conversational podcast feel, and is largely natural for Spanish listeners. Minor lexical choices prevent a perfect score, but they do not affect understanding.\n\n**Total score:** 91/100 (sum of the five criteria)."
