    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable. The sentences convey the main ideas and the logical flow of the podcast dialogue is preserved. However, there are several very long sentences and occasional repetitions (e.g., \"comienza antes de que la IA comience\") that make the text a bit harder to follow for a casual reader.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many expressions that sound awkward to native speakers. Examples include \"un/una graduado/a\", \"afinado o ajustado con precisión\", \"el término 'ancrage' podría traducirse...\" (a meta‑comment that does not belong in the dialogue), and the repetitive use of \"comienza\". Vocabulary is adequate but the phrasing is often literal and not idiomatic, which reduces the naturalness of the text.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly (pre‑entrenamiento, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL). Nevertheless, the translation is inconsistent with \"fine‑tuning\": it appears as \"afinado\", \"ajustado con precisión\" and later as \"afinamiento\", whereas the standard term in Spanish is \"ajuste fino\". The word \"ancrage\" is left untranslated and explained in a clumsy way, which can confuse readers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator has kept the original intent and tone of a podcast conversation. Cultural references are neutral, so no major mis‑adaptations occur. Some added explanatory clauses (e.g., \"El término 'ancrage' podría traducirse...\") are unnecessary and break the flow, but overall the purpose of explaining the difference between ICL and fine‑tuning is maintained.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the main points of the French script are present: pre‑training, transfer learning, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, the concept of temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the emerging \"memory\" feature. Minor nuances such as the exact wording of \"mémoire à usage unique\" are slightly altered, but no essential information is omitted.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the overall structure and informational content of the original podcast, but it suffers from several fluency and terminology issues that make it sound stilted. In particular, inconsistent rendering of \"fine‑tuning\" and the presence of meta‑comments disrupt the natural dialogue. Improving idiomatic phrasing and standardizing technical vocabulary would raise the quality significantly.\n\nOverall, the translation is functional and conveys the key concepts, yet it requires polishing to reach a native‑speaker level of readability and naturalness.\n\nScore out of 20 points (average of the five criteria): 15/20."
