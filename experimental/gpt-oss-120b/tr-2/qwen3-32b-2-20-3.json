  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the flow of the dialogue mirrors the original. Concepts such as pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino y aprendizaje en contexto are explained in a way that a non‑specialist Spanish‑speaking audience can grasp. Only a couple of very long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but overall comprehension is excellent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Vocabulary is appropriate and the register matches a podcast style. There are a few slightly awkward constructions (e.g., “es una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”, “El registro completo de su conversación en esta sesión es el contexto”), but they do not hinder understanding and could be smoothed with minor edits.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje (grounding). The translator kept the English acronyms where useful and provided Spanish equivalents, which helps readers who may not be familiar with the English jargon. No major mistranslations of technical concepts were found.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and tone of the original conversation are preserved. Cultural references are neutral, and the analogy of a “consultor brillante” works well in Spanish. Minor idiomatic refinements could make the speech feel a bit more colloquial, but the adaptation is overall successful.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue turns from the French source are present, and no substantive information was omitted or altered. The translation adds no unnecessary redundancy and keeps the content concise while retaining every key point about pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto y funciones de memoria.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, reads smoothly for a Spanish‑speaking audience, and maintains the original podcast’s explanatory tone. Only a few phrasing choices feel slightly stilted; polishing those would bring the text to a near‑perfect level.\nOverall, the work demonstrates strong competence in both linguistic and domain‑specific translation.\nScore: 18/20.\n\nOverall Score (average of criteria): 17.8 ≈ 18."
