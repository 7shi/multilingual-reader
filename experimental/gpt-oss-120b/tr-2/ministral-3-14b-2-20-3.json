  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the main ideas and the flow of the conversation is generally clear. However, the presence of parenthetical notes, editorial comments (e.g., “(or alternatively: …)”), and some leftover French/English fragments disrupt the smooth reading experience. A few sentences are overly long or contain redundant wording, which slightly reduces comprehension for a typical listener.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly understandable but contains several unnatural constructions: “engager un consultant brillant” is left in French, the formatting with asterisks and double‑asterisks is odd, and some literal translations sound stiff (e.g., “el preentrenamiento (o, alternativamente, preentrenado…)”). These issues make the text feel less like native Spanish prose.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (AEC), memoria de contexto, grounding → “anclaje a la realidad”. The terminology is consistent throughout, and the explanations are appropriate for a non‑specialist audience. Minor inconsistencies (ICL vs AEC) do not majorly affect understanding.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts cultural elements (e.g., renaming the podcast to “Tecno Destello” at the end) and keeps the tone conversational. Nonetheless, residual meta‑comments and placeholders indicate a lack of full adaptation to the target audience, and some phrasing remains too literal.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. The only losses are the untranslated French phrase and occasional editorial notes, which are minor omissions.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully transmits the technical content and overall structure of the podcast script. It is accurate and fairly complete, but the inclusion of editorial notes, leftover French/English fragments, and occasional awkward phrasing prevent it from feeling fully polished or native‑like. A cleanup of the meta‑comments and a few stylistic adjustments would raise the fluency and readability substantially.\n\nOverall score (sum of criteria): 73/100."
