  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow; sentences are logically ordered and the technical ideas are explained clearly. A few minor awkward constructions (e.g., “Cuando se comienza una nueva conversación”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part and uses appropriate vocabulary. There are occasional stilted phrases (“memorización intensiva”, “el sistema busca rápidamente en sus intercambios anteriores”) that feel slightly forced, but they do not break the flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje, ajuste fino, etc. The usage is consistent throughout the text and the occasional English loan (fine‑tuning) is kept in parentheses for clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts the examples to a Spanish‑speaking audience without cultural mismatches. Metaphors such as “consultor brillante” work well, and the explanation of the new “Memoria” feature is clearly conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No key points are omitted, and the dialogue structure is preserved. The only slight loss is the hyphenation of “pré‑entraînement”, which does not affect meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately and remains understandable for a non‑specialist audience. Minor phrasing issues prevent it from being perfectly fluent, but they are not serious enough to affect the listener’s comprehension. The handling of terminology and preservation of nuance are especially strong points.\n\nSuggested improvements: smooth out a few stiff expressions (e.g., replace “Cuando se comienza una nueva conversación” with “Cuando se inicia una nueva conversación”) and consider using more idiomatic alternatives for “memorización intensiva”.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 17.6 → rounded to 18/20."
