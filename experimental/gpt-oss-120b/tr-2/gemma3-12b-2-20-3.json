  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally easy to follow and conveys the ideas of the original French dialogue. Sentences are logically ordered and the technical concepts are explained in a clear manner. Minor issues such as \"una enorme cantidad de datos en la Internet\" (awkward preposition) and occasional overly literal phrasing slightly hinder smooth comprehension, but they do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural for a native Spanish speaker, especially in a conversational podcast format. A few expressions feel slightly clunky (e.g., \"una enorme cantidad de datos en la Internet\", retention of the English word \"prompt\" without adaptation). Nevertheless, the overall flow is smooth and the register matches the informal‑educational tone of the original.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding, etc., are correctly rendered and used consistently. The decision to keep \"prompt\" in English is acceptable for the target audience familiar with AI jargon. No major mistranslations of key terms are observed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original context appropriately. Conversational markers (\"Imaginad\", \"Es como contratar a un consultor brillante\") and cultural references (\"bachotear\") fit Spanish‑speaking listeners. The intent, humor and explanatory style of the podcast are preserved, showing good cultural sensitivity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is retained. No sentences or ideas are omitted, and the technical explanations remain intact. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy, keeping the content concise while preserving full meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high‑quality. It conveys the technical content clearly, maintains the podcast’s lively tone, and uses appropriate Spanish phrasing. Minor stylistic tweaks (preposition usage, occasional Anglicisms) could improve fluency, but they do not detract significantly from comprehension. The work demonstrates solid competence in both linguistic and domain‑specific translation.\n\n**Total score (out of 100): 89**\n\n**Strengths:** accurate terminology, faithful retention of content, good adaptation to the target audience.\n**Areas for improvement:** smooth out a few literal constructions and consider fully localizing remaining English loanwords for maximum naturalness."
