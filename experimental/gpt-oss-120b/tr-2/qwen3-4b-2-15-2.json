    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the ideas are conveyed in a logical order. Most sentences are understandable, and the technical concepts are explained similarly to the original. Minor issues such as the wrong preposition in \"Hola y bienvenido **en**\" and occasional punctuation quirks slightly hinder smooth reading, but they do not cause major confusion.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several unnatural constructions and inconsistencies: \"Hola y bienvenido en\" (should be \"a\"), mixed use of \"usted\" and \"tú\", a typo \"empieze\", and phrases like \"Usted ha entendido todo\" that sound stilted. Vocabulary is mostly appropriate, but the flow feels a bit mechanical in places, preventing the text from feeling completely native.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\" and the translation of \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\" are accurate and consistent. The occasional retention of English words such as \"prompt\" is acceptable in a tech‑focused podcast context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts the content for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Some literal renderings (e.g., \"aprendizaje de último momento\") are slightly odd, and the shift between formal and informal address can be confusing, but overall the cultural tone and purpose are preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of “memory” features. No significant information is omitted, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in conveying the technical content and overall narrative of the podcast. Readability and completeness are strong, and terminology is accurate. However, fluency suffers from several grammatical slips, inconsistent register, and occasional awkward phrasing, which prevents the text from feeling fully natural to native Spanish listeners. Minor edits would bring the translation to a high‑quality level.\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 16/20.\n\nOverall rating: 16/20.\n\nScore: 16"
