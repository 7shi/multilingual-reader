  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the flow of ideas follows the original. Most sentences are easy to understand, and complex concepts are explained in a straightforward way. A few minor hiccups (e.g., “Usted ha entendido todo” instead of a more natural “Has entendido todo”) do not significantly impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are occasional literal renderings that feel slightly stiff for a native speaker. Phrases such as “Usted ha entendido todo” and “una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado” are understandable yet not the most idiomatic. Overall the language is smooth enough for a podcast script.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL”, “grounding” (rendered as “anclaje”), and “memoria a corto plazo” are all appropriate and consistently used. The translator kept the English acronyms and provided Spanish equivalents where needed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of the podcast. Cultural references are minimal, and the Spanish version adapts the dialogue naturally for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor phrasing choices (e.g., “es una artimaña?”) could be smoother, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is retained. No substantive details are omitted, and the explanations remain complete. The translation does not add unnecessary redundancy, keeping the content concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the technical content clearly. It is readable and mostly fluent, with only occasional literal phrasing that slightly reduces naturalness. Terminology is well managed, and the original message is fully preserved. Minor stylistic tweaks could bring the fluency closer to native‑speaker level, but the work is solid for its intended audience.\n\nScore (sum of criteria): 87/100."
