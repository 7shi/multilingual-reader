  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and the ideas are easy to follow. Most sentences convey the original meaning, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that a non‑expert can grasp. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., \"en la internet\", \"Hola y bienvenido en\") slightly detract from smooth comprehension but do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several unnatural or literal constructions that a native speaker would not use: \"es del aplastar\", \"Tale es la realidad\", \"es ahí donde se interviene\". The punctuation (missing opening ¡, commas) and occasional word order feel foreign‑translated. Despite these issues, the flow is acceptable, but the text does not read as a polished native‑language script.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje, prompt, etc. The translator kept the original English/French terms in quotes where appropriate, which helps consistency. A few minor inconsistencies (e.g., occasional use of \"prompt\" without translation) are harmless.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original podcast style and maintains the informal conversational tone. Cultural references are unchanged (the podcast name \"Tech Éclair\" remains appropriate). The intent and humor are preserved, and the adaptation does not introduce any culturally inappropriate elements.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French source is present. No sentences or ideas were omitted, and the logical sequence is intact. Minor stylistic differences do not affect the factual content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the full content of the original French podcast script and uses correct technical vocabulary. Readability is good, but fluency suffers from several literal translations and awkward phrasing that a native Spanish speaker would likely rewrite. Terminology and completeness are strong points. With a light edit to improve naturalness, the text would be excellent for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\nOverall score (sum of the five criteria): 88/100 (average 17.6/20)."
