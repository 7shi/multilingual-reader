  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original logical flow. Most sentences are clear, but a few awkward constructions (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en”, missing articles, and occasional missing punctuation) slightly impede smooth reading.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several non‑native expressions and grammatical slips: “bienvenido en”, “el afinamiento”, “es una trampa” (instead of a better rendering of *bachotage*), and the invented word “antiespuma” for *antisèche*. These make the translation feel stilted for a native speaker.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *ventana de contexto* and *anclaje* are correctly rendered and used consistently. However, the mistranslation of *antisèche* as “antiespuma” and the occasional retention of English words like “prompt” without explanation reduce precision.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and the pedagogical tone, but cultural‑linguistic mismatches (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido en”, misuse of “trampa”, and the nonsensical “antiespuma”) detract from a fully adapted text.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All main ideas from the French script are present; no major sections are omitted. The only loss is a subtle nuance in the phrase “L'apprentissage en contexte, c'est du bachotage”, which is rendered as “es una trampa”, altering the meaning slightly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the overall structure and most of the content of the original podcast script, but it suffers from several linguistic inaccuracies and unnatural phrasing that affect fluency and cultural appropriateness. Technical terminology is mostly handled well, though a few mistranslations (notably “antiespuma”) and missing explanations for specialized terms lower the quality. Readability is acceptable, but a native Spanish speaker would notice the awkward constructions. Overall, the translation is functional but needs revision for naturalness and precise terminology.\n\nOverall score (average of the five criteria): 13/20."
