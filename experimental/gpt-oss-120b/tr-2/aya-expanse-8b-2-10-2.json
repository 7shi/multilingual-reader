  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the logical flow of the podcast dialogue is preserved. Minor hiccups (e.g., occasional long sentences) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for the most part, but a few expressions feel slightly stilted or literal (e.g., “hacer un resumen rápido” for “bachotage”, “ventana de contexto” instead of a more common “ventana de contexto”). These do not break fluency but prevent a completely native feel.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered and consistently used: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje, etc. Parentheses are used when the original French term is kept, which helps readers familiar with the literature.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., “Tech Éclair” → “Tech Relámpago”). The tone of a podcast conversation is kept, and the explanation of “memoria” features is clear for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the original script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the “memory” tricks used by some platforms. No significant content is omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and maintains a clear, educational tone suitable for a podcast audience. Technical vocabulary is well‑handled and cultural adaptation is thoughtful. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve naturalness, but overall the work is high quality.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 18/20."
