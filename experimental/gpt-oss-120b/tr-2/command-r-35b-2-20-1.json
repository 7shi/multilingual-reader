    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. Sentences are generally clear, the flow of the dialogue mirrors the original, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained with simple analogies. Minor punctuation choices (e.g., “pre‑entrenamiento”) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and the informal podcast tone is maintained. A few constructions feel slightly forced – e.g., “El registro completo de tu conversación en esta sesión es el contexto” (a more idiomatic phrasing would be “Todo el historial…”) and “El aprendizaje en acción” – but overall the language is smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly: “fine‑tuning” → “afinamiento”, “In‑Context Learning” → “aprendizaje en contexto”, “ventana de contexto”. The choice of “enraizamiento” for the concept of grounding is less common; “anclaje” or “contextualización” would be more usual. Consistency is kept, but the occasional non‑standard term lowers the score slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts well to the Spanish‑speaking audience. The podcast title is rendered as “Tech Relámpago”, maintaining the original wordplay. Cultural references and the conversational style are preserved, and the explanations are tailored for Spanish listeners without losing the original intent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French script is present in the Spanish version. No major ideas are omitted, and the analogies (consultant vs. permanent expert, cramming for an exam) are kept. Redundancies are minimal and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the technical content accurately, retains the lively podcast tone, and is largely easy to read for Spanish speakers. Minor issues with a few less‑common lexical choices and occasional phrasing quirks keep it from being perfect, but these do not impede understanding.\n\nStrengths: clear exposition of AI concepts, faithful preservation of dialogue dynamics, good cultural adaptation.\nWeaknesses: occasional non‑standard terminology (e.g., “enraizamiento”), a couple of slightly awkward sentences, and minor punctuation inconsistencies.\n\nThe translation would be well‑received by a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in technology podcasts.\n\nScore (sum of criteria): 88/100."
