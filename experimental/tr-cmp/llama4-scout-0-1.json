    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand. Sentence structures are clear and follow logical patterns. Complex concepts like pre-training, fine-tuning, and in-context learning are explained in an accessible manner. However, minor awkward phrasing, such as 'ella lee' instead of just 'lee' or the translation of 'bachoter', slightly impacts the overall smoothness for a native speaker, though not critically hindering comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The most significant issue affecting fluency is the inconsistent use of formal ('usted') and informal ('tú') address throughout the dialogue. Luc switches between 'Mire' and 'Puede tomar' (usted form) and 'Tienes todo claro', 'Ajustas', 'No necesitas' (tú form). Camille also uses 'hablar con usted' at one point, conflicting with the overall implied informal tone. This inconsistency makes parts of the conversation sound unnatural. There's also a grammatical error ('forma astuce' instead of 'forma astuta') and some slightly less natural phrasing in analogies (e.g., 'hacer un examen de manera superficial' for 'bachoter').",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as 'pré-entraînement' (pre-entrenamiento), 'affinage' (ajuste / fine-tuning), 'apprentissage par transfert' (aprendizaje por transferencia), 'fenêtre de contexte' (ventana de contexto), 'apprentissage en contexte / ICL' (aprendizaje en contexto / ICL), and 'ancrage' (anclaje / grounding) are translated accurately and consistently throughout the text. The term 'solicitud' for 'prompt' is acceptable, though 'prompt' itself or 'instrucción' is also very common in the AI context. The parenthetical clarification for ICL is helpful.",

    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely conveys the original text's intent as a conversational podcast. However, the inconsistent use of 'tú'/'usted' forms detracts from the natural, informal conversational context of a podcast between two hosts. More importantly, the translation of 'antisèche' as 'resumen' (summary) is a significant loss of an analogy's nuance; 'antisèche' means 'cheat sheet' and implies a covert or temporary aid, which is central to the explanation of how AI memory features work. 'Resumen' does not carry this implication, weakening the analogy's impact.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French text is conveyed in the Spanish translation without significant omissions. The core concepts of AI learning, temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and memory mechanisms are all present. Some nuance is lost in the analogies ('bachoter' and 'antisèche'), but this doesn't equate to a loss of factual information or key concepts.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation effectively conveys the technical content of the podcast, demonstrating a good understanding of the subject matter. Most technical terms are handled well. However, the overall quality is diminished by a lack of consistency in the use of informal versus formal address ('tú' vs. 'usted'), which makes parts of the dialogue sound unnatural for a conversational podcast. Furthermore, some idiomatic expressions and analogies ('bachoter' and especially 'antisèche') were not translated with their full intended nuance, impacting the clarity and effectiveness of the explanations. Addressing these issues would significantly improve the fluency and contextual appropriateness for a native Spanish-speaking audience."
