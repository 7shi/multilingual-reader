    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally easy to read and understand. Complex concepts are clearly explained, and the sentence structures are logical. While some phrasing is a bit formal for a podcast, it does not significantly hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The fluency is hampered by an inconsistent use of formal (usted) and informal (tú) address, especially prominent when Luc switches from 'usted' to 'tú' in the sentence 'No necesitas que te recuerden los principios del equilibrio...' The choice of certain terms like 'Por lo tanto' or 'Eso es exactamente correcto' also makes the dialogue sound slightly stiff and less natural for a casual podcast conversation. The untranslated 'cheat sheet' breaks the flow.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "There is an inconsistency in the translation of the technical term 'affinage' (fine-tuning). It is initially translated as 'afinamiento' but later correctly as 'ajuste fino,' which is the standard term in the AI/ML field. Additionally, the French term 'antisèche' (crib sheet) is replaced with the English 'cheat sheet' instead of a Spanish equivalent ('chuleta' or 'hoja de trucos'), which is a terminology lapse.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text's intent and purpose are mostly conveyed. However, the conversational and somewhat informal tone of a podcast is not always perfectly captured due to the formal word choices and the inconsistency in addressing the listener (usted vs. tú). The translation could have adapted better to a more natural, engaging podcast style in Spanish.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original text has been conveyed without any omissions. The explanations are clear and sufficient, and there is no unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely accurate in conveying information, but it suffers from notable issues in fluency and terminology. The inconsistent use of formal and informal address ('usted'/'tú') significantly detracts from its naturalness and consistency in a podcast context. The fluctuating translation of key technical terms and the untranslated 'cheat sheet' also indicate areas for improvement. While readable, it could benefit from a more natural and consistent Spanish voice for the target audience."
