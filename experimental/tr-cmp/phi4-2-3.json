    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely easy to understand and follows a logical flow for the target audience. Complex concepts like pre-training, fine-tuning, and in-context learning are explained clearly. However, minor grammatical awkwardness (e.g., \"Eso es por qué\") and the imprecise translation of \"fenêtre de contexte\" to simply \"contexto\" slightly reduce the overall clarity and precision, especially for a technical topic. The choice of \"sistemas opacos\" instead of \"cajas negras\" for \"boîtes noires\" is understandable but less idiomatic.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While many parts read naturally, there are notable grammatical errors (\"Él transfiera\" instead of \"Él transfiere\", \"Las nuevas conocimientos\" instead of \"Los nuevos conocimientos\") and unnatural phrasings (\"Eso es por qué\" appearing multiple times, \"una mucho menor cantidad\" for \"una cantidad mucho menor\", \"La IA no se está siempre ajustando\"). These issues prevent the text from achieving a fully natural and smooth rhythm. The translation of \"en coulisses\" as \"en la conversación en segundo plano\" is less idiomatic than \"tras bambalinas\" or \"en el prompt en segundo plano\" given the context.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Terms like \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino (fine-tuning)\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are correctly translated and explained. However, the translation of \"fenêtre de contexte\" as simply \"contexto\" is a critical error, as \"ventana de contexto\" is the precise and standard term, leading to a loss of specificity. Additionally, changing \"ICL (In-Context Learning)\" to \"AIC (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\" is less than ideal, as ICL is the widely recognized international acronym, and introducing a new one could cause confusion.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational and explanatory tone of the original podcast is well-preserved. The analogies used (university graduate, physics student, cramming for an exam, riding a bike, engaging a consultant) are effectively transferred and remain clear in Spanish. The overall intent to demystify AI learning processes for a general audience is successfully conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation accurately covers all the information presented in the original French text. No key concepts, examples, or explanations seem to be missing. The differentiation between temporary knowledge (ICL) and permanent skill (fine-tuning) is clearly maintained.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is a good effort that successfully conveys the core concepts of AI learning processes in a conversational style. However, it is significantly hampered by several grammatical and fluency issues, as well as crucial inaccuracies in the translation of key technical terms like \"fenêtre de contexte\" and the modification of the \"ICL\" acronym. While understandable, these issues detract from the precision and naturalness expected in a professional translation, particularly for a semi-technical topic."
