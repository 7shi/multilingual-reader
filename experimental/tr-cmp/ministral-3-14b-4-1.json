    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The provided text is largely incomprehensible as a coherent translation. It consists mostly of placeholders, instructions, and meta-commentary rather than actual translated content. This fragmented structure and the presence of non-translated elements make it impossible for any reader to follow the original narrative or understand the concepts being discussed. Only very isolated phrases are translated, preventing any meaningful readability.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text lacks any semblance of fluency because it is not a complete translation. While the few segments that do offer a Spanish rendition are generally fluent and use appropriate vocabulary, they are surrounded by extensive meta-comments and untranslated placeholders. This makes the overall text completely unnatural and far from a smooth, native-sounding Spanish dialogue.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "For the very limited portions that *are* translated, technical terms like 'preentrenamiento,' 'aprendizaje por transferencia,' 'ventana de contexto,' and 'aprendizaje contextual' are generally handled correctly and appropriately. However, the vast majority of technical terms from the original French text are not translated at all, or are embedded within instructions. Therefore, the overall adherence to appropriate and consistent terminology across the entire text is extremely poor due to missing content.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text is a dialogue from a podcast, aiming for an informative yet conversational tone. The provided 'translation' entirely loses this context and purpose. It is presented as a series of instructional notes for a translator, not as a finished or even partially finished translation of a podcast transcript. The tone, intent, and cultural adaptation are completely absent due to the fundamental nature of the submitted text.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This criterion scores extremely low as the vast majority of the original French text's information has not been conveyed in Spanish. Most sentences are replaced by placeholders like 'Revised version (addressing all issues while preserving the original tone and intent):' or instructional notes. Therefore, nearly all the information from the source text is omitted.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "The provided text is not a translation but a collection of instructions, placeholders, and meta-commentary about how a translation *should* be done, with only sporadic actual translated phrases. As such, it cannot be evaluated as a functional translation. It completely fails to convey the original content, context, or intent. The scores reflect the near-complete absence of actual translated content."
