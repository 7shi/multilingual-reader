    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally easy to read and understand. Concepts are explained clearly, and the sentence structure mostly flows well. However, some phrases could be more idiomatic or naturally structured in Spanish, such as 'Eso es exactamente' instead of 'Exactamente' or 'Así es,' and 'Los conocimientos que proporciona en la solicitud son temporales' which could be improved for subject clarity. 'Tú tienes todo comprendido' would be more natural as 'Lo has comprendido todo.'",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly fluent, but there are several instances where expressions feel slightly unnatural or less idiomatic for a native Spanish speaker. Examples include 'el afinamiento' (while understood, 'ajuste fino' is more common in AI contexts), 'Miren' as a general call to attention, 'la solicitud' for 'prompt' (which is usually 'el prompt' or 'la instrucción'), and leaving 'cheat sheet' untranslated. The use of 'ancrage' instead of 'anclaje' is also a significant fluency issue.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While many technical terms like 'pre-entrenamiento,' 'aprendizaje por transferencia,' 'ventana de contexto,' and 'aprendizaje en contexto' are correctly translated, there are notable inconsistencies and errors. 'El afinamiento' for 'fine-tuning' is less standard than 'ajuste fino.' 'Solicitud' for 'prompt' is not the most appropriate term; 'prompt' or 'instrucción' are preferred. Crucially, 'ancrage' (French for grounding) is used directly in Spanish ('ancrage') instead of its correct Spanish equivalent, 'anclaje.' The English term 'cheat sheet' is also left untranslated.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation successfully conveys the original text's intent and maintains the conversational, podcast-like tone. Analogies (e.g., school, consultant, riding a bike) are adapted well. The explanation of 'bachotage' as 'repasar intensamente para un examen' is a good cultural adaptation. However, the choice of 'trampa' for 'astuce' could be softer (e.g., 'truco' or 'artificio'), and the failure to translate 'cheat sheet' detracts from full contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original French text has been accurately conveyed in the Spanish translation. No significant details or explanations appear to be omitted, and the logical flow of the discussion is preserved. The translation provides a complete representation of the source content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation effectively conveys the core message and maintains the conversational tone of the podcast. However, its quality is significantly hampered by inconsistent and sometimes incorrect technical terminology, notably the direct use of French 'ancrage' and English 'cheat sheet,' as well as less common choices for 'fine-tuning' and 'prompt.' While readability is generally good, some phrases could be more natural and idiomatic in Spanish. Addressing these terminology and fluency issues would greatly improve the overall quality."
