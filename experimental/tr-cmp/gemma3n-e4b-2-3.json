    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally comprehensible, and the sentence structure is logical. However, the inconsistent use of formal and informal address forms (tú, usted/ustedes, vosotros) can be jarring and slightly impede smooth reading for a native Spanish speaker. The omission of inverted question marks also affects standard Spanish punctuation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The major issue affecting fluency is the inconsistent use of second-person pronouns (tú, usted/ustedes, vosotros). This creates an unnatural flow and sounds unpolished. Additionally, there are a few lexical choices that could be more natural in Spanish (e.g., 'Bonjour' instead of 'Hola/Buenos días', 'analizar' instead of 'levantar el velo'). A clear grammatical error ('Por qué' instead of 'Es por eso que') also impacts fluency.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms like 'pre-entrenamiento,' 'fine-tuning' (with 'ajuste fino' in parentheses), 'aprendizaje por transferencia,' 'ventana de contexto,' 'aprendizaje en contexto,' and 'anclaje' (with 'grounding') are handled excellently. The translator correctly preserves specialized terms like 'Transformers' and 'prompt' as they are commonly used in the field. This demonstrates a strong grasp of the subject matter's specific vocabulary.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "While the overall tone appropriate for a technical podcast is maintained, the inconsistent use of second-person address forms (tú, usted/ustedes, vosotros) significantly detracts from the contextual adaptation. A podcast should establish a consistent way to address its audience. Some nuanced phrases, like 'en coulisses' (behind the scenes) and 'antisèche' (cheat sheet), were translated in a way that loses some of their original implied meaning or informality, impacting the natural flow of the conversation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information and concepts from the original French text are present in the Spanish translation. There are no notable omissions or additions that alter the meaning or completeness of the content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully conveys the core technical information and handles specialized terminology very well. However, its quality is significantly hampered by the inconsistent use of second-person pronouns (shifting between 'tú', 'ustedes', and 'vosotros'), which makes the text unnatural and unpolished for a Spanish-speaking audience. Addressing this consistency issue and refining a few lexical choices would greatly enhance the overall translation quality. The grammatical error ('Por qué' instead of 'Es por eso que') should also be corrected."
