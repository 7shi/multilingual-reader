    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely comprehensible, and the explanations of complex AI concepts are clear. The sentence structure generally flows well, making it easy to follow the discussion. However, the untranslated French phrase 'C'est tout à fait ça.' is a glaring error that momentarily disrupts readability, and a few minor instances of less natural phrasing slightly detract from the overall smooth reading experience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation suffers from several significant fluency issues. The most critical is the complete failure to translate 'C'est tout à fait ça.', leaving a French phrase embedded in the Spanish text. There's also a clear grammatical error/typo ('conociencia' instead of 'conocimiento') and an unnatural phrasing in the sentence 'Que siempre estuviera siendo afinada por tus conversaciones sería increíblemente ineficaz,' which also subtly changes the original meaning. Minor issues like 'subes en la bici' instead of 'a la bici' also detract from naturalness.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The translation consistently uses appropriate and standard terminology for AI and machine learning concepts in Spanish. Terms such as 'pre-entrenamiento,' 'afinamiento' (for fine-tuning), 'aprendizaje por transferencia,' 'ventana de contexto,' and 'anclaje' are all correctly and consistently applied. No instances of incorrect or inconsistent technical terms were found.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational and informative tone of the podcast is generally well-maintained throughout the translation, and the analogies used (e.g., fresh graduate, brilliant consultant, studying for an exam) are effectively transferred and make sense in the target culture. However, the subtle misinterpretation of Luc's statement about AI not being constantly fine-tuned ('L'IA n'est pas constamment affinée par vos conversations. Ce serait incroyablement inefficace.') slightly alters the original intent from a statement of fact to a hypothetical condition, which impacts contextual fidelity.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation suffers from a significant information completeness issue: the phrase 'C'est tout à fait ça.' is completely untranslated from French and appears verbatim in the Spanish text, representing a direct omission of its meaning. Additionally, the rephrasing of 'L'IA n'est pas constamment affinée par vos conversations. Ce serait incroyablement inefficace.' into a conditional statement ('Que siempre estuviera siendo afinada...') subtly distorts the original factual assertion, leading to a minor loss of precise information.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a good grasp of technical terminology and generally maintains the conversational tone of the original podcast. However, it contains several critical errors that significantly impact its quality. The most notable issues are the complete omission of a translated phrase, a major grammatical error/typo, and a rephrasing that distorts the original meaning of a sentence. These flaws severely affect fluency and information completeness, indicating a need for thorough proofreading and correction of specific segments to reach a professional standard."
