    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally very clear and easy to follow. Sentence structures are logical, and complex concepts are explained in a comprehensible manner, similar to the original podcast's intent. There are no significant barriers to understanding the content for a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While largely natural, some phrases feel a bit literal or slightly awkward, preventing a higher score. Examples include 'ajustas finamente' instead of 'afinas' or 'pones a punto', and 'espacio temporal de trabajo' which could be more naturally 'espacio de trabajo temporal'. The translation of 'prompt' as 'encadenamiento (la entrada de usuario a la IA)' is particularly clunky and unnatural. There's also a minor repetition ('Ella olvida todo' after 'Olvida todo').",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Several technical terms are accurately translated, such as 'entrenamiento previo', 'puesta a punto', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', and 'ventana de contexto'. However, there are two significant errors: 1. 'ICL (In-Context Learning)' is translated as 'AIC (Aprendizaje Interactivo Contextual)', which invents a different acronym and misrepresents the original term. 2. 'Prompt' is translated as 'encadenamiento (la entrada de usuario a la IA)', which is not the standard or natural term in Spanish tech contexts; 'prompt' itself is often used, or 'indicación' / 'petición'. These errors are crucial in a technical discussion.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation effectively captures the conversational and explanatory tone of the original podcast. Analogies are well-preserved, and the overall purpose of simplifying complex AI concepts for a general audience is met. The addition of 'Dicho esto, ha llegado el momento de concluir' at the end fits the podcast context well.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the information from the original text is conveyed. However, the misrepresentation of 'ICL' as 'AIC' and the translation of 'prompt' as 'encadenamiento' constitute a loss of precise technical information. While the general idea is still present, the specific and correct terminology, crucial for understanding AI concepts, is altered, impacting the completeness of specific details.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is generally easy to read and maintains the conversational tone of the original podcast. However, it suffers from significant issues in technical terminology, specifically with the mistranslation of 'ICL' and 'prompt', which are core concepts in the discussed topic. While the general meaning is conveyed, these inaccuracies reduce the overall quality and reliability for a technically informed audience. Some minor fluency issues also detract from an otherwise decent translation."
