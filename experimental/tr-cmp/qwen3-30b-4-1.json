    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The readability is severely hampered by a significant chunk of repeated text (from 'Soy Luc...' through to '...general.') appearing mid-conversation, making that section unintelligible and impossible to follow. Even ignoring this major error, the inconsistent use of formal 'usted' and informal 'tú' throughout the podcast, when the original 'vous' was general, creates a jarring experience for the reader and detracts from the flow. Some sentences, like 'Hola y bienvenida' for a general greeting, are also awkward.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While many individual sentences are grammatically correct, the overall fluency is compromised by several factors. The inconsistent address (tú/usted) feels unnatural and unprofessional for a podcast. Phrases like 'Hola y bienvenida' (should be 'bienvenidos'), 'Es decir, porque...' (unnecessary repetition of 'es decir'), and 'hasta la próxima para el próximo episodio' (redundant) contribute to a less natural sound. The use of 'procesa' instead of 'lee' for a human-like analogy also slightly shifts the nuance.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally handles technical terminology well, with appropriate choices for 'preentrenamiento', 'afinamiento' (or 'ajuste fino'), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', and 'anclaje'. However, the repeated explanation of 'ICL (aprendizaje en contexto)' where the original only gave 'ICL (In-Context Learning)' is redundant. Additionally, 'resumen' for 'antisèche' (cheat sheet) is a less precise translation; 'chuleta' or 'apuntes' would have been more accurate in the informal context of a 'cheat sheet'.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text's intent and purpose, which is to explain complex AI concepts in an accessible, conversational podcast format, are partially conveyed. However, the inconsistent formal/informal address (tú/usted) fails to adapt correctly to the context of a general audience in Spanish, creating an awkward and inconsistent tone. This significantly impacts the sense of connection with the listener that a podcast aims for. While the analogies are preserved, the direct addressing of the audience is flawed.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The most severe issue affecting information completeness is the large block of repeated text. Instead of translating the segment where Camille talks about the AI after pre-training being like a university graduate, the translator pasted previous dialogue, making the original content of that segment completely lost or obscured by redundancy. This is a critical error. Aside from this, minor omissions like 'exacts' in 'documents d'information exacts' are negligible, but the major repetition makes this score very low.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation demonstrates a strong understanding of technical terminology but suffers from critical flaws in execution, particularly regarding readability and information completeness. The major repetition of earlier dialogue in a later segment is a severe error that renders a portion of the text incomprehensible. Furthermore, the inconsistent use of formal and informal address ('tú' vs. 'usted') for the audience creates an unnatural and unprofessional tone for a podcast. While many individual phrases are translated correctly, these pervasive issues significantly detract from the overall quality, making the text difficult to read and understand in a natural Spanish context."
