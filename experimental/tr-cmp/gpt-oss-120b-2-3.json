    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is almost entirely empty. There is no content to read or understand, making it impossible to assess readability or clarity of complex concepts. The text consists of speaker names followed by ellipses or single, incomplete words.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "With no complete sentences or phrases translated, there is no natural flow or smooth expression. The 'translation' is effectively blank, thus demonstrating no fluency.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "No technical terms from the original text are translated or handled in any way, as the content is missing. Therefore, appropriateness, explanations, or consistency cannot be evaluated.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Since virtually no content has been translated, the original text's intent and purpose are not conveyed. There is no consideration for cultural background or optimization of expressions.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Nearly all information from the original text has been omitted. The 'translation' provides no content, leading to a complete lack of information completeness.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "The provided 'translation' is essentially empty. It consists only of speaker names followed by ellipses or truncated words, with no actual translated content from the original French text. As such, it fails to meet any quality criteria for translation, scoring zero across all categories."
