    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally understandable, and complex concepts are mostly explained clearly, sometimes with helpful additions. However, some phrases are a bit literal or awkward, and the inconsistent use of formal (usted) and informal (tú) address can be jarring and slightly impede a smooth reading experience. The verbose explanation for 'fine-tuning' also breaks the flow of a conversational podcast.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation suffers from significant fluency issues, primarily due to inconsistent formality. The dialogue switches between 'tú' and 'usted' forms without a clear pattern, which sounds unnatural to a native speaker. There are also several grammatical errors, such as 'las conocimientos' (should be 'los'), 'al IA' (should be 'a la IA'), and 'se recuerda de' (should be 'recuerda'). Some phrasing is too literal from French, making it less idiomatic in Spanish.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "This is a weak point of the translation. The technical term 'affinage' (fine-tuning) is not translated with a standard Spanish equivalent like 'ajuste fino' or 'refinamiento' but is instead given a lengthy and less precise explanation. 'Ancrage' (grounding) is incorrectly translated as 'encastrement.' Most notably, 'ICL' is expanded to 'Aprendizaje por Inserción y Calibración (ICL),' which is a non-standard and inaccurate backronym for 'In-Context Learning' (which should be 'aprendizaje en contexto'). These errors significantly impact the technical accuracy.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The core intent and purpose of the podcast are largely conveyed. Some expressions are well-adapted, such as 'chuleta' for 'antisèche.' However, the inaccurate technical terminology hinders the effective conveyance of the specific AI concepts being discussed. The inclusion of the translator's personal comment within the translated text is also an error in contextual adaptation and output format.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the important information from the original text is present. However, there are minor omissions, such as the missing phrase 'para quiconque utiliza estos herramientas' in Camille's final question. There are also some unnecessary additions, like the translator's self-comment, the redundant 'o 'vacía'' when describing an empty context, and the expanded outro. Grammatical errors and a typo ('Aprendrá' instead of 'Aprenderá') also slightly detract from the precision of the information.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation provides a generally understandable rendering of the source text, but it is significantly hampered by inconsistent formality, grammatical errors, and, most critically, inaccurate and non-standard technical terminology. While some parts are well-adapted, the issues with key terms like 'fine-tuning,' 'grounding,' and 'ICL' undermine its quality as a technical explanation. The inclusion of translator comments within the final output is also an formatting error."
