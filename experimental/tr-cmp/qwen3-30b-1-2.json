    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The core concepts are generally clear and understandable. However, the inconsistent use of formal/informal and singular/plural pronouns (e.g., 'imaginen' vs. 'no enseñarías' vs. 'has comprendido' vs. 'usted proporciona' vs. 'necesito') introduces friction and makes some parts less smooth to read. While the individual sentences are mostly grammatical, the overall flow is impacted by this lack of consistency in addressing the audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The most significant issue affecting fluency is the inconsistent pronoun usage. A podcast typically addresses its audience consistently, often using 'ustedes' (or 'vosotros' in Spain). The constant switching between 'tú', 'usted', 'ustedes', and even 'yo' (in the final question) creates an unnatural and awkward reading experience for a native speaker. Additionally, some phrases like 'está hecho posible' (for 'est rendue possible') or 'Eso es exactamente lo que quiero decir' (for 'C'est tout à fait ça') could be more naturally phrased. A minor typo 'increiblemente' (missing accent) also detracts slightly.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The translation handles technical terminology very well. Terms like 'pre-entrenamiento', 'afinamiento' (and 'ajuste fino'), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto' (ICL), and 'anclaje' (grounding) are all correctly and consistently translated. The explanation of 'bachoter' as 'estudiar de última hora' is an excellent and natural adaptation for the Spanish context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally conveys the original intent and the informative, conversational tone of a podcast. The analogies are well-maintained. However, the inconsistent addressing of the audience (as detailed in fluency and readability) detracts from the natural contextual adaptation. A consistent 'ustedes' would have better suited the podcast format and made the dialogue feel more natural for the target audience. The shift to 'Necesito' at the end is particularly jarring.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French text has been accurately conveyed in the Spanish translation. There are no omissions or misinterpretations of the content. The explanations of complex AI concepts are clear and retain their original meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is strong in its accurate transfer of information and the appropriate use of technical terminology. All the nuances of AI learning concepts are well-explained and preserved. However, the overall quality is significantly impacted by a persistent inconsistency in pronoun usage, which detracts from the fluency, readability, and naturalness of the dialogue for a podcast format. Addressing this would greatly improve the user experience. There are also a few instances of slightly awkward phrasing and a minor typo that could be corrected."
