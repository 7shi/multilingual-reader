  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is highly fragmented, interspersed with untranslated French and English phrases, internal notes, and instructions. Entire sentences and dialogue turns are missing. This makes the text utterly incoherent and impossible to read as a continuous conversation or understand its meaning.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The overall fluency is severely compromised by the extensive omissions, untranslated segments, and meta-commentary. While a few isolated Spanish phrases are grammatically correct, the vast majority of the text does not flow naturally or smoothly due to the broken structure. There are also several grammatical errors in the Spanish segments, such as 'los palabras' instead of 'las palabras' and unnatural phrasing like 'debo necesitar'.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The few technical terms that are translated into Spanish (e.g., 'preentrenamiento', 'afinado', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto', 'anclaje') are generally correct, and the inclusion of original English terms in parentheses is a good practice. However, due to the massive information incompleteness, the consistent and comprehensive handling of all terminology throughout the entire text cannot be properly assessed.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation completely fails to adapt to the original context, which is a conversational podcast. The fragmented nature, missing dialogue, and inclusion of internal notes destroy any sense of a natural conversation between Camille and Luc. The engaging and explanatory tone of the original is entirely lost, making it impossible to convey the intent or purpose of the source text.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This criterion is where the translation fails most significantly. A vast amount of critical information from the original French text is either entirely omitted, left untranslated (in French or English), or replaced by internal process notes. Key explanations, analogies, and parts of the dialogue essential for understanding the AI concepts are missing, rendering the translation incomplete and uninformative.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "This submission cannot be considered a functional translation. It is an incomplete collection of fragments, untranslated segments, and internal notes, rather than a coherent Spanish rendering of the source text. Consequently, it is unreadable, lacks fluency, and fails to convey almost any of the original information or context. The translation process appears to be severely flawed or unfinished."
