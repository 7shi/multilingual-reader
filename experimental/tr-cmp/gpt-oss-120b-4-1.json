    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is incomplete and consists mostly of ellipses, speaker names, and placeholders. There is no coherent text to assess for readability or comprehensibility in the target language. Therefore, it is impossible for target language readers to understand the content.",

    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "With virtually no actual translated text provided beyond speaker names and ellipses, it's impossible to evaluate the fluency or naturalness of the language. There are no sentences or phrases to assess for awkward grammar, unnatural expressions, or vocabulary choices.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "No technical terms from the original French text have been translated into Spanish. The output contains only speaker tags and non-textual elements, making it impossible to evaluate the appropriateness or consistency of terminology.",

    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text's intent and purpose, which is a podcast discussion about AI, are not conveyed at all in the provided output. There is no content to evaluate for cultural background consideration or optimization, as the translation is entirely missing.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is almost entirely missing. None of the important information from the original French text has been conveyed. The output does not contain any substantive content, making it 100% incomplete.",

    },
    "overall_comment": "The provided translation is critically incomplete, consisting only of speaker tags, ellipses, and placeholders. No actual content from the original French text has been translated into Spanish. As such, it is impossible to evaluate any aspect of translation quality meaningfully, and all criteria receive a score of zero."
