    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "Only a very small fraction of the original text has been translated. While the few translated lines are individually comprehensible, the overwhelming omission of content makes the \"translation\" as a whole completely unreadable and incomprehensible, as the dialogue is entirely broken and most information is missing.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The extremely sparse translation renders the entire text devoid of natural flow or coherence. While the isolated translated sentences might be grammatically correct, their lack of connection to the surrounding (missing) dialogue makes any assessment of overall fluency impossible, and functionally, the text is not fluent.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Only a handful of technical terms were translated (e.g., \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"IA\"), and these were correctly rendered. However, the vast majority of the original text's technical terminology, which forms the core of the discussion, has been omitted, making the assessment of appropriate handling for the full text impossible and leading to a failure in this criterion.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The pervasive omissions mean that the original text's intent and purpose (to explain AI learning processes) are not conveyed at all. The translation is a fragmented collection of sentences, losing all contextual meaning and cultural adaptation considerations.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is severely incomplete, omitting nearly the entire dialogue. Only a minuscule fraction of the original text's information is present, making it impossible for the reader to understand the topic discussed, the flow of the conversation, or any of the key concepts presented in the source. This is a critical failure in conveying information.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "The provided translation is almost entirely empty, comprising only a few scattered sentences from the original transcript. It completely fails to convey the vast majority of the information, context, and intent of the source text. It cannot be considered a functional translation."
