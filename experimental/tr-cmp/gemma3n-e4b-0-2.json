    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The core concepts are explained clearly, and the sentence structures are generally logical and easy to follow. However, the frequent and inconsistent shifts between 'tú', 'usted', and 'vosotros/ustedes' forms for addressing the audience introduce an element of awkwardness and can momentarily distract the reader, slightly impacting flow and full comprehensibility in terms of consistent address.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The most significant issue is the highly inconsistent use of formal/informal and singular/plural address forms (tú, usted, vosotros, ustedes). This makes the dialogue sound unnatural and disjointed for a native speaker. Additionally, leaving 'Bonjour' and 'Je suis Camille' untranslated at the beginning is a clear error. Minor grammatical issues like 'las informaciones' instead of 'la información' and 'forma astucia' instead of 'forma astuta' further reduce naturalness.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The technical terminology is handled very well. Appropriate Spanish equivalents are used consistently ('pre-entrenamiento', 'ajuste fino', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto', 'anclaje'). The inclusion of the original English terms in parentheses ('fine-tuning', 'grounding') is also helpful for clarification without being intrusive.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text's conversational and explanatory intent is generally conveyed, and the podcast format is maintained effectively. However, the inconsistent formal/informal and singular/plural address forms (tú/usted/vosotros/ustedes) prevent a natural and consistent interaction tone with the audience, slightly undermining the direct and engaging nature of a podcast.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original text has been accurately translated and conveyed. There are no omissions or redundancies. The explanations of complex concepts like pre-training, fine-tuning, and in-context learning are complete and clear within the translated text.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation accurately conveys the technical content and retains all of the original information. However, its overall quality is significantly hampered by pervasive grammatical and fluency issues, primarily the highly inconsistent usage of Spanish address forms (tú, usted, vosotros, ustedes). This makes the dialogue feel unnatural and unprofessional for a podcast transcript. Minor untranslated words and grammatical slips also detract from the overall quality. While the terminology is well-handled, the severe fluency issues prevent it from being a high-quality translation."
