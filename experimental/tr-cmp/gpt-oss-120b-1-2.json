    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally very clear and easy to follow. Sentence structures are logical and well-formed. However, there is one instance where 'Por qué' (why) was used instead of 'Porque' (because) at the beginning of a sentence ('¿Por qué ya comprende...?' should be 'Porque ya comprende...'). This minor grammatical error slightly disrupts the flow and the intended explanatory nature of the sentence.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds very natural and smooth to a native Spanish speaker. The choice of vocabulary, including excellent idiomatic expressions like 'levantar el velo', 'estudiar a última hora' (for bachoter), and 'una chuleta' (for antisèche), significantly enhances naturalness. The only detractor from a perfect score is the 'Por qué' vs 'Porque' error, which slightly impacts the natural flow of that specific sentence.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled with great accuracy and consistency. 'Pre-entraînement' is correctly translated as 'preentrenamiento', 'affinage' as 'afinamiento' (and later 'ajuste fino', both acceptable terms for 'fine-tuning' and clarified with the English parenthetical), 'apprentissage par transfert' as 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'fenêtre de contexte' as 'ventana de contexto', 'apprentissage en contexte' as 'aprendizaje en contexto', and 'ancrage' as 'anclaje'. The inclusion of the original English terms in parentheses where provided in the source text is also well-maintained, ensuring clarity for a technical audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation effectively conveys the original text's intent and purpose as a podcast dialogue. The conversational tone between Camille and Luc is perfectly preserved, and the analogies used (school, physicist, cycling, consultant) are all well-adapted and resonate with the target audience. The shift from 'vous' to a consistent 'ustedes' (implied in verb conjugations and direct address) is appropriate for the target culture and context.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original text has been conveyed without any omissions. The translation is precise, concise, and avoids any redundancy while maintaining the clarity and depth of the discussion. No additional information was introduced, and all nuances were retained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "This is a high-quality translation that excels in capturing the natural flow and tone of the original podcast. The technical terminology is accurately and consistently rendered, and the contextual adaptation, including excellent idiomatic choices, is superb. The only minor flaw is a single grammatical error ('Por qué' instead of 'Porque'), which slightly affects readability and fluency but does not detract significantly from the overall excellent quality of the translation."
