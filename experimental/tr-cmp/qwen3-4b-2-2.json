  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The constant switching between formal and informal address ('tú' and 'usted'), alongside numerous grammatical errors (verb conjugation, gender/number agreement, missing articles, incorrect prepositions), significantly hinders the readability. Many sentences feel clunky or directly translated, requiring the reader to re-read or infer meaning. The lack of proper punctuation (missing question/exclamation marks) also adds to the difficulty.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text lacks natural flow and often sounds like a literal translation from French. The most prominent issue is the inconsistent use of 'tú' and 'usted' forms within the same dialogue and even within the same sentence, which is highly jarring for a native Spanish speaker. Poor word choices (e.g., \"bachotaje\", \"astucia\", \"pauta\" for \"antisèche\") and grammatical errors further contribute to an unnatural feel.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most core technical terms like \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", and \"ventana de contexto\" are correctly identified. However, there are minor inconsistencies (\"ajuste fino\" and \"afinamiento\") and less appropriate choices (\"bachotaje\" for 'cramming'). The redundancy in explanations like \"ancrage (anclaje)\" and \"ICL (Aprendizaje en contexto)\" is also a drawback. A significant error is the use of \"pauta\" instead of a more accurate equivalent for \"antisèche\" (crib sheet), which changes the nuance of the information.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "While the overall intent and information are generally conveyed, the translation fails to adapt the conversational style naturally to Spanish. The formality inconsistencies create an awkward dynamic between the speakers, which is not present in the original. Some phrases that would be casual and engaging in French come across as stiff or incorrect in Spanish, reducing the effectiveness of the podcast format.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation successfully conveys all the important information from the original text without significant omissions. However, there are a few instances where the meaning is slightly distorted due to lexical errors (e.g., \"estos extraños\" instead of \"estos extractos\") or less-than-ideal word choices that affect clarity, though not outright completeness of facts. Redundancy (e.g., repeating the Spanish translation for ICL) makes it less concise.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation suffers from numerous grammatical errors, poor lexical choices, and a pervasive inconsistency in formality (mixing 'tú' and 'usted' forms). While the core information is generally present, these issues significantly impair readability and naturalness, making the text sound stiff and unpolished, much like a raw machine translation. Post-editing is critically needed to correct syntax, improve fluency, and establish a consistent tone."
