    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally easy to understand, and complex concepts are explained clearly through analogies, maintaining the clarity of the original. The sentence structures are logical and contribute to good comprehensibility.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While largely comprehensible, the translation exhibits several instances of awkward phrasing and inconsistency that detract from its naturalness. Examples include the direct translation of 'Bonjour y bienvenido', the repetitive use of 'analizar', the somewhat clunky 'debido al inglés', and the grammatical error 'Por qué puede convertirse' instead of 'Por eso puede convertirse'. The most significant issue is the inconsistent use of 'tú' and 'ustedes/vosotras' forms when addressing the listener/Camille, which breaks the natural flow of a podcast dialogue. Also, 'extraídos' should be 'extractos' and 'de forma automática' is repeated unnecessarily.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled very well. The translation consistently uses appropriate Spanish equivalents (e.g., 'pre-entrenamiento', 'ajuste fino', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'anclaje'), often retaining the original English term in parentheses for clarity, which is a good practice for this type of content. This demonstrates a solid understanding of the domain-specific language.",

    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation effectively conveys the original text's intent and purpose, which is to explain complex AI concepts in an accessible, conversational podcast format. The analogies used in the original are successfully transferred and maintain their explanatory power in Spanish. The tone is consistent with a friendly, informative discussion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original text has been accurately conveyed without any noticeable omissions. The explanations are complete, and no superfluous information has been added, maintaining conciseness and clarity.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely accurate and effectively conveys the technical content from French to Spanish, making it understandable to the target audience. The strengths lie in its accurate terminology and successful transfer of the original's informative and conversational intent. However, its major weakness is in its fluency and naturalness, particularly due to inconsistent pronoun usage and several minor grammatical and lexical awkwardnesses. Addressing these linguistic nuances would significantly elevate the overall quality to sound more idiomatic to native Spanish speakers."
