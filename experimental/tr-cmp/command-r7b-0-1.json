    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The core content is understandable, but the readability is severely impacted by the pervasive and often incorrect use of exclamation marks, which distorts the natural conversational flow and tone. Additionally, inconsistencies in formal/informal address forms and minor grammatical errors (e.g., 'el afinar' instead of 'el afinamiento') make the text less smooth and occasionally jarring to read.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation lacks naturalness due to several factors. The most prominent is the overuse and misuse of exclamation marks, which makes much of the dialogue sound overly enthusiastic or aggressive, rather than conversational. Inconsistencies in the pronoun choice for 'you' (shifting between 'tú', 'usted', and 'nosotros' where 'vous' was consistently used in French) create an uneven and awkward tone. Grammatical errors like 'el afinar' (should be 'el afinamiento'), 'una truco' (should be 'un truco'), and 'en só mismo' (should be 'en sí mismo') further detract from the overall fluency.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most key technical terms such as 'pré-entraînement' (preentrenamiento), 'apprentissage par transfert' (aprendizaje por transferencia), 'fenêtre de contexte' (ventana de contexto), and 'ancrage' (ancoraje) are translated correctly and consistently. However, there are a couple of notable issues: 'affinage' is sometimes translated as the grammatically incorrect verb phrase 'el afinar' instead of the noun 'el afinamiento', and the acronym ICL (In-Context Learning) is expanded as 'Aprendizaje en Contexto Interno', which is an incorrect addition of 'Interno' and not a standard Spanish equivalent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "While the core informational intent of the podcast is conveyed, the translation struggles with contextual adaptation. The original French podcast had a balanced, informative, and engaging tone. The Spanish translation's heavy reliance on exclamation marks creates an exaggerated and often inappropriate tone for an educational podcast. The inconsistent shifts in formality (tú/usted) also disrupt the expected conversational dynamic between the hosts and with the audience, making it less professional and natural in a podcast setting.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation successfully conveys all important information from the original text. No significant details or concepts appear to be omitted. The issues identified are primarily related to style, grammar, and tone rather than the absence of information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation accurately captures the technical information of the original French podcast, ensuring information completeness. However, its overall quality is significantly undermined by recurring stylistic and grammatical issues. The most pervasive problem is the excessive and often incorrect use of exclamation marks, which drastically alters the intended conversational tone, making the Spanish text sound unnaturally enthusiastic and, at times, jarring. Furthermore, inconsistencies in addressing the listener (shifting between 'tú' and 'usted' forms), along with several grammatical errors ('el afinar', 'una truco', incorrect ICL expansion, 'en só mismo'), detract from the text's naturalness and professionalism. While the technical terminology is mostly well-handled, these frequent distractions severely impact readability and fluency, preventing the translation from achieving a high standard."
