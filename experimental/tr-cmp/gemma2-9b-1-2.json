  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The readability is severely impacted by the presence of large sections of untranslated French text. Even in the translated parts, there are several grammatical errors (e.g., gender agreement like 'los palabras', 'esas conocimientos', 'las informaciones') and awkward phrasing that disrupt the flow and make the text harder to follow. Missing punctuation also contributes to reduced readability.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Fluency is critically compromised by the verbatim inclusion of French sentences and phrases within the Spanish translation. This breaks the natural flow entirely. Additionally, there are instances of unnatural phrasing and vocabulary choices, such as 'Ustedes han comprendido todo' when addressing a single person, or 'la acción del aprendizaje en contexto' which sounds less natural than alternatives.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While key terms like 'pre-entrenamiento', 'ajuste fino' (though inconsistent with 'afinamiento' later), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', and 'ventana de contexto' are correctly identified and translated, there are significant issues. The term 'ancrage' is left in French, which is not a standard Spanish technical term in this context. More critically, 'automatisé' was mistranslated as 'automático' instead of 'automatizado' in 'aprendizaje automático contextualizado'. The untranslated segments also mean that technical explanations are lost.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text's intent and purpose, which is to explain complex AI concepts clearly using analogies, are not fully conveyed due to significant information omissions and untranslated sections. The analogy of 'antisèche' (cheat sheet) was lost by translating it as 'una pista' (a hint), diminishing the specific nuance. The direct inclusion of French text fails completely in adapting to the target Spanish-speaking audience.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This is the most significant weakness of the translation. Multiple sentences and entire phrases from the original French text are either completely omitted or copied verbatim in French, failing to convey the information in Spanish. This leads to a highly incomplete and fragmented translation that misses crucial explanations and examples from the source text.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is critically flawed due to numerous and pervasive issues. The most severe problem is the extensive presence of untranslated French segments, which makes the text incomprehensible in parts and entirely unusable for a Spanish-speaking audience. Beyond this, there are significant omissions of information, rendering the content incomplete. Grammatical errors, inconsistencies in terminology, and some unnatural phrasing further detract from the quality. While some individual phrases are translated correctly, the overall quality is extremely poor and fails to meet basic translation standards."
