    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely absent, with most of the original content replaced by ellipses or truncated words. As such, it completely lacks any semblance of natural flow or fluency in Spanish.",

      "reasoning": "Due to the extreme incompleteness of the translation, no technical terms have been properly rendered into Spanish. Therefore, their appropriateness or consistency cannot be assessed.",

      "reasoning": "The translated text is so sparse that it fails to convey any intent or purpose from the original French. No contextual or cultural adaptation is evident or possible given the missing content.",

      "reasoning": "The translation is critically incomplete, with nearly all information from the original text missing. It consists predominantly of ellipses, indicating a complete failure to convey the source content.",

    "overall_comment": "This translation is severely incomplete, rendering it entirely unusable and impossible to evaluate on any qualitative metric. It appears to be a placeholder or a failed translation attempt rather than a complete rendition of the original text."
