    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally easy to follow, and the explanations of complex AI concepts are clear. Sentence structures are logical and do not impede understanding. However, the inconsistent use of 'tú' and 'usted' forms, while not making the text incomprehensible, can be jarring and requires the reader to mentally adjust, slightly impacting the flow and ease of reading. For example, 'Los conocimientos que proporcionas' (tú) followed by 'siempre se le ha proporcionado' (usted).",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The most significant issue affecting fluency is the inconsistent pronominal address. The original French 'vous' is translated variably as 'tú' and 'usted,' leading to an unnatural and awkward reading experience for a native Spanish speaker. Specific examples include the switch from 'proporcionas' (tú) to 'Usted ha entendido' (usted) within the same dialogue. Additionally, certain lexical choices, such as 'Buenos días' instead of 'Hola' for a podcast introduction, 'en silencio' for 'en coulisses' (behind the scenes), and 'un resumen' for 'une antisèche' (a cheat sheet), feel less natural or are inaccurate, further impacting the overall flow and naturalness.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The translation demonstrates strong command of technical terminology. Key terms like 'preentrenamiento', 'afinado' (fine-tuning), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto' (ICL), and 'anclaje' (grounding) are consistently and accurately translated. The explanation of ICL's full form in Spanish is a good detail. The handling of 'información' as a singular mass noun in Spanish, where the French uses a plural, is also correct.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally maintains the informal, conversational tone appropriate for a podcast, and the analogies used to explain complex concepts (e.g., university graduate, consultant, cramming vs. mastering) are well-preserved. However, the inconsistency in direct address ('tú' vs. 'usted') disrupts the intended direct and consistent interaction with the listener. The nuanced meaning of phrases like 'en coulisses' (behind the scenes) being rendered as 'en silencio' (silently) slightly misses the mark contextually.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French text is present in the Spanish translation. No key concepts, details, or steps in the AI learning process are omitted. The explanations remain as thorough as in the source, and no unnecessary information is added. The dialogue flow and topic progression are fully maintained, ensuring the reader receives all intended content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation effectively conveys the core technical information and maintains the conversational tone of the original podcast. Key technical terms are translated accurately and consistently. However, the inconsistent use of formal ('usted') and informal ('tú') address forms throughout the text significantly detracts from its naturalness and fluency in Spanish. Minor lexical choices (e.g., 'buenos días' for a general greeting, 'en silencio' for 'behind the scenes', 'resumen' for 'cheat sheet') also slightly reduce the overall quality. Addressing the pronominal consistency would greatly improve the text's flow for a native Spanish speaker."
