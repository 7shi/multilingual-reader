    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally understandable, but several instances of awkward phrasing, overly literal translations, and slightly unnatural word order (e.g., \"documentos precisos de información\" instead of \"documentos de información precisos\") hinder a completely smooth reading experience. Some sentences are a bit clunky or verbose, requiring the reader to re-read to fully grasp the intended meaning easily. Examples include \"Ella lee una cantidad muy grande de datos\" instead of \"ingente cantidad\" and \"la totalidad del historial de su conversación... es el contexto\" which could be more concise.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation suffers from several grammatical inconsistencies and unnatural expressions. The chosen podcast title \"Linterna Tecnológico\" does not sound natural or capture the essence of \"Tech Éclair\" (lightning/flash tech). The mixed use of \"tú\" and \"usted\" forms of address creates an inconsistent tone. Phrases like \"expansión en masa\" for \"massive expansion\" and \"en la indicación\" for \"in the prompt\" are direct literal translations that sound awkward in Spanish. Pronoun agreement issues (e.g., \"debo dárselos nuevamente\" when referring to feminine \"información\") and slightly stiff constructions detract from the overall naturalness for a native Spanish speaker. The ending \"Gracias por haber escuchado\" should be \"Gracias por habernos escuchado\" to agree with the 'us' implied in the podcast.",

    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most key technical terms like \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\" (fine-tuning), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" (context window), and \"anclaje\" (grounding) are translated correctly and consistently. However, the introduction of \"AEC\" as an acronym for \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\" is non-standard and potentially confusing, as \"ICL\" is already widely accepted and often used directly in Spanish tech contexts. The translation of \"prompt\" as \"indicación\" is acceptable but \"prompt\" is also commonly used and understood in the tech community, or \"instrucción\" could be a clearer alternative. The term \"antisèche\" (cheat sheet) being translated as \"resumen\" (summary) misses the specific nuance of the analogy.",

    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall informative yet conversational tone of a podcast is generally maintained. However, the cultural adaptation of the podcast title \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Linterna Tecnológico\" loses the original's sense of \"flash\" or \"lightning\" (implying quick, insightful tech news). The inconsistent use of formal \"usted\" and informal \"tú\" when addressing the listener or the AI creates a mixed tone that doesn't fully adapt to Spanish conversational norms, where a consistent choice is usually preferred in such contexts. The analogy involving \"antisèche\" losing its precise meaning as \"resumen\" also slightly weakens the intended comparison.",

    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French text has been accurately conveyed in the Spanish translation. There are no notable omissions of content or concepts, and no unnecessary redundancies. The core message and technical explanations, including the analogies used to clarify complex ideas, are fully present. The information flow is logical and follows the original progression.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is functional and largely conveys the core message accurately, making the content generally understandable. However, it frequently suffers from overly literal renditions from French to Spanish, leading to stiffness, unnatural phrasing, and occasional grammatical awkwardness. Improvements in idiomatic expressions, consistent use of address (tú/usted), and more precise vocabulary choices (especially for analogies and non-standard acronyms) would significantly enhance its fluency and readability for a native Spanish speaker. The technical terminology is mostly handled well, but the podcast title and some specific analogies could be adapted more effectively."
