    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The readability is severely hampered by a significant block of text that remains untranslated in the Spanish output, instead containing the original French and an English translation. This abruptly breaks the flow and makes the text incomprehensible at that point for a Spanish reader. Additionally, the meta-commentary provided for 'C'est-à-dire ?' further disrupts the reading experience. Some minor phrases, like 'Es pues', are slightly formal for a conversational podcast, but the main issue is the untranslated section.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The untranslated paragraph completely undermines the fluency, as it's an abrupt stop in the Spanish text. Apart from this major issue, some phrases like '¿Es decir?' are overly literal and don't sound natural in a conversational context where clarification is requested. 'Es pues una memoria de un solo uso' is also a bit stiff. The use of 'solicitud' for 'prompt' or 'requête' is not the most natural or precise choice in a technical context. The singular 'conocimiento' for plural 'connaissances' also indicates some grammatical oversight.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While terms like 'pre-entrenamiento', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', and ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto) are correctly handled, there are inconsistencies and inaccuracies. 'Affinage' is translated variously as 'ajuste fino', 'mejora (afinación)', and 'afinamiento', which lacks consistency. The term 'solicitud' for 'prompt' or 'requête' is not the most accurate technical term; 'prompt' or 'instrucción' would be better. Most notably, the analogy 'antisèche' (cheat sheet) is translated as 'guía', losing the nuanced meaning of a quick, informal aid.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The core intent and purpose of explaining complex AI concepts through analogies are significantly undermined by the untranslated paragraph, which contains a crucial analogy about hiring a consultant. This completely fails to convey the original meaning and conversational dynamic. The nuance of 'antisèche' being a 'cheat sheet' rather than a 'guide' is lost, weakening an analogy. The inclusion of meta-comments in the translation output also shows poor contextual adaptation for a final text.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A substantial paragraph, containing a key explanation and analogy about In-Context Learning (ICL) and the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, is entirely missing from the Spanish translation. Instead, the original French text and an English translation are present. This represents a critical omission of information, leading to a significant loss of content from the original message.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation is critically flawed due to the presence of a large untranslated segment, which includes the original French text and an English translation instead of the target Spanish. This single error severely impacts every aspect of the evaluation, from readability and fluency to information completeness and contextual adaptation. Beyond this major issue, there are inconsistencies in terminology, some less natural phrasing, and a loss of nuance in certain analogies. While some individual sentences are translated accurately, the overall quality is significantly compromised by these substantial errors."
