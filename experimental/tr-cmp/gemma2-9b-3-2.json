    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally understandable, but the constant switching between 'tú' and 'usted' forms for addressing Camille (or the audience) creates a jarring and confusing reading experience, making it difficult to follow the dialogue's flow consistently. The mistranslation of 'antisèche' also significantly impedes understanding of a key analogy.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "This is the weakest point of the translation. The arbitrary alternation between formal and informal address forms (tú/usted/ustedes) is highly unnatural for a Spanish dialogue and makes the text sound awkward and unpolished. There are also a few instances of less natural phrasing or vocabulary choices, such as 'informaciones' (should be 'información') and the slightly less common 'afianzamiento' for fine-tuning, which is less precise than 'ajuste fino'.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms ('preentrenamiento', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'anclaje') are correctly translated and consistent. However, the use of both 'ajuste fino' and 'afianzamiento' for 'affinage' introduces a minor inconsistency, as 'ajuste fino' is the more standard term in this context.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The primary failure in contextual adaptation is the inconsistent register of formality (tú/usted). In a conversational podcast, maintaining a consistent tone is crucial for listener comfort and naturalness. The mistranslation of 'antisèche' also demonstrates a lack of full contextual understanding of the analogy's impact. The inconsistency in translating the podcast title at the beginning ('Tecnología Flash') and then reverting to the original French at the end ('Tech Éclair') also detracts from adaptation.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "While most information is conveyed, there are minor omissions (e.g., 'spécifique' for professional experience) and, more significantly, a major mistranslation of 'antisèche' as 'una señal', which distorts a key analogy about providing a 'cheat sheet'. The slight change in subject in 'Cuando abres una nueva ventana, la IA reinicia...' also subtly alters the original meaning.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully conveys the core technical concepts, and many technical terms are handled correctly. However, its overall quality is severely compromised by a pervasive and inconsistent use of formal and informal address forms ('tú' vs. 'usted/ustedes') throughout the dialogue, making it sound highly unnatural and confusing to a native Spanish speaker. Additionally, a critical analogy is lost due to a mistranslation ('antisèche' as 'una señal'), and there's an inconsistency in the podcast title's translation. While the general message is clear, these issues significantly impact the fluency, readability, and overall professionalism of the Spanish text."
