    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is understandable, and the core concepts are conveyed. However, frequent grammatical errors (like incorrect gender and verb agreement, missing prepositions, and awkward sentence structures) disrupt the flow and make it less smooth to read for a native Spanish speaker. The reader has to work a bit harder to process some sentences.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "This is the weakest aspect of the translation. Many sentences sound unnatural and are direct, literal translations from French structures, rather than adapted to natural Spanish idiom. Examples include 'bienvenido en', 'la manera en que', 'al transfiriendo', 'es por ello una memoria de uso único', 'qué se dice de las nuevas funcionalidades', and 'es una astucia'. These issues create a stiff and unidiomatic text that does not flow well.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are translated correctly and consistently, such as 'preentrenamiento', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', and 'anclaje'. 'Afinamiento' for 'fine-tuning' is acceptable, though 'ajuste fino' or 'sintonización fina' are also common. The main oversight is leaving 'antisèche' untranslated, which is a common French term for 'cheat sheet' or 'crib sheet' and should have been rendered as 'chuleta', 'apunte' or 'machete'. Also, 'astucia' for 'astuce' is a bit strong; 'truco' or 'estrategia' might have been better.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to maintain the conversational podcast style, but its effectiveness is severely undermined by the numerous grammatical and fluency issues. While the intent to inform and explain is clear, the awkward phrasing detracts from the engaging and informal tone expected in a podcast. The overall listening experience (if read aloud) would be less natural and compelling for a Spanish audience.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French text has been conveyed in the Spanish translation. There are no omissions of important details or concepts. The explanation of complex ideas, such as in-context learning vs. fine-tuning, is fully present.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is successful in conveying all the information from the source text, demonstrating good information completeness. However, its overall quality is significantly impacted by frequent grammatical errors, including issues with gender agreement, verb agreement, and preposition usage. This, coupled with a general lack of natural fluency and several instances of overly literal translation from French, makes the text sound stiff and unnatural in Spanish. While technical terms are mostly handled correctly, some common French terms were either mistranslated or left untranslated, further affecting the naturalness and accuracy. To improve, the translation needs extensive review for grammatical correctness and idiomatic expression in Spanish."
