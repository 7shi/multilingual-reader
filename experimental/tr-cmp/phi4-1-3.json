    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally easy to follow, and the sentence structures are logical. However, there are a few grammatical errors and typos that slightly hinder readability, such as 'mecánica cuantica' instead of 'mecánica cuántica', 'conociencia' instead of 'conocimiento', and 'Las nuevas conocimientos' which should be 'Los nuevos conocimientos' or 'Las nuevas informaciones'. These minor issues prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While much of the text flows well, there is a significant and repeated error where the French phrase 'C'est tout à fait ça' is directly copied into the Spanish translation without being translated to a natural Spanish equivalent (e.g., 'Exactamente', 'Así es', 'Correcto'). This is a major detractor for naturalness. Additionally, phrases like 'la manera en que la IA 'se acuerda' de estas informaciones' could be more fluid ('recuerda' instead of 'se acuerda' for an AI, and 'información' as a collective singular). The sentence 'Que siempre estuviera siendo afinada por tus conversaciones sería increíblemente ineficaz' also sounds a bit clunky. These points reduce the overall fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The translation demonstrates excellent handling of technical terms. Concepts like 'pre-entrenamiento', 'afinamiento' (fine-tuning), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto' (ICL), and 'anclaje' (grounding) are consistently and accurately translated, including the parenthetical English explanations when present in the source. This is a strong point of the translation.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation effectively conveys the original text's intent and purpose, maintaining the conversational tone suitable for a podcast. The analogies used (e.g., university graduate, physicist, consultant, studying for an exam) are well-preserved and culturally relevant for a Spanish audience. No significant expressions needed improvement or optimization that were missed, and the overall context is well-adapted.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original text is accurately conveyed without any omissions. The translation does not introduce any unnecessary redundancy, and the content remains concise and clear. The dialogue structure is also perfectly maintained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely accurate and preserves the meaning and tone of the original French podcast. It excels particularly in the faithful translation of technical terminology and the completeness of information. However, its overall quality is significantly impacted by notable fluency issues, primarily the repeated direct copying of the French phrase 'C'est tout à fait ça' without translation, and some other less natural phrasing. There are also a few grammatical errors that affect readability. While strong in conveying technical concepts and information, the execution of natural conversational Spanish could be improved to reach a higher standard."
