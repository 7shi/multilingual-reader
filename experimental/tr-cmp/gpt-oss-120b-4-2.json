    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The target text is almost entirely absent, containing only ellipses, 'N/A', or single non-contextual words. As such, there is no content for a reader to understand, making it completely unreadable and incomprehensible.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "With virtually no translated content, the text cannot be assessed for naturalness or smoothness. The few isolated fragments present do not form coherent or fluent Spanish.",

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "No technical terms from the original text, such as 'pré-entraînement' (pre-training), 'affinage' (fine-tuning), or 'apprentissage en contexte' (in-context learning), have been translated or explained in the target text. Therefore, the appropriateness of terminology cannot be evaluated, as it is entirely missing.",

    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text's intent and purpose, which is to explain AI learning processes, are not conveyed at all because the translation lacks nearly all content. There is nothing to adapt contextually or culturally.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is critically incomplete, as it omits virtually all information from the original text. Essential details, explanations, and concepts are entirely missing, rendering the translation useless for conveying information.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "This submission is not a translation but rather an almost entirely empty response, filled with placeholders like '...' or 'N/A'. It fails to translate any meaningful part of the original French text into Spanish. Consequently, it delivers no information, possesses no readability, and demonstrates no fluency or appropriate terminology. It is completely unusable."
