    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is almost entirely missing, consisting of placeholder ellipses and 'N/A'. There are no complete sentences or coherent thoughts to follow, rendering it completely unreadable and incomprehensible.",

    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "With virtually no content provided beyond '...' and 'N/A', it is impossible to assess the naturalness, grammatical correctness, or smooth flow of the Spanish text. There are no vocabulary choices or sentence structures to evaluate.",

    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "None of the technical terms such as 'pré-entraînement', 'affinage', 'apprentissage par transfert', 'fenêtre de contexte', 'apprentissage en contexte', or 'ancrage' are translated or explained. The translation's incompleteness means there is no handling of terminology whatsoever.",

      "reasoning": "The translation fails to convey the original text's intent or purpose, as it is almost entirely empty. There is no content to adapt contextually or culturally to a Spanish-speaking audience.",

      "reasoning": "The translation is almost entirely missing, omitting nearly all information from the original French text. It is profoundly incomplete and fails to convey any of the source content.",

    },
    "overall_comment": "This is not a translation. It is an empty response filled with placeholders and 'N/A', failing to provide any meaningful rendition of the original French text. It does not convey any information, fluency, or readability, and therefore has zero utility."
