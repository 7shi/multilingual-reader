    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally comprehensible, but several stylistic and grammatical issues hinder smooth reading for a native Spanish speaker. The consistent omission of the opening question mark (¿) in interrogative sentences is a fundamental orthographic error. Some sentences maintain a French structure, leading to less natural flow in Spanish. Furthermore, critical technical errors force the reader to re-read sections or guess the intended meaning, significantly impacting ease of understanding.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation lacks naturalness due to multiple issues. Grammatical errors like '¡Bonjour' instead of '¡Hola', 'presentárle' instead of 'presentarle', and 'forma astucia' instead of 'forma astuta' are present. There's inconsistent pronoun usage, switching between 'tú', 'usted', and 'vosotros' forms within the dialogue, which is highly unnatural in Spanish. Awkward phrasing like 'Ella lee' for 'elle lit' or 'Es porque' for 'C'est pourquoi', and the unedited 'concluir/terminar/finalizar' at the end, further detract from the overall fluency.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "This is the weakest aspect of the translation. A critical error occurs when 'l'apprentissage par transfert' (transfer learning) is mistranslated as 'ajuste fino' (fine-tuning) at a pivotal point, completely distorting the technical explanation. The term 'affinage' is inconsistently translated as 'afinamiento', 'ajuste', and 'ajuste fino' throughout the text. Additionally, technical phrases like 'dans le prompt, en coulisses' and 'extraits' are inaccurately rendered, further compromising technical precision. The analogy 'antisèche' (cheat sheet) is also lost by being translated simply as 'resumen'.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to fully adapt the content to the target context. The misinterpretation of key technical terms and analogies (like 'antisèche') means the original intent and explanatory power are not effectively conveyed. The inconsistent and fluctuating use of formal and informal address ('tú' vs 'usted' vs 'vosotros') creates an unprofessional and confusing tone for a podcast dialogue. Minor omissions, such as 'C'est un sujet fascinant' and the nuance of 'n'est-ce pas?', also diminish the overall contextual fidelity.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "While most words are transferred, the *meaning* of critical information is compromised. There are several minor omissions (e.g., 'C'est un sujet fascinant', 'spécifique' for task, 'étonnamment', 'n'est-ce pas?'). More significantly, the misinterpretation of core AI concepts, particularly 'transfer learning' and the details of 'in-context learning' (prompt, behind-the-scenes), leads to a distortion of the information provided, rather than a complete and accurate conveyance of the original content.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation provides a basic understanding of the podcast's topic but suffers from significant quality issues. The most severe flaw is the fundamental misunderstanding and inconsistent handling of key AI technical terms, which undermines the core educational purpose of the content. Coupled with pervasive grammatical errors (especially missing initial question marks), inconsistent pronoun usage, and unnatural phrasing, the translation lacks the fluency and precision expected for professional content. It reads more like a direct, unedited machine translation rather than a polished, contextually adapted text."
