      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as 'preentrenamiento', 'afinamiento (fine-tuning)', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto (In-Context Learning)', and 'anclaje (grounding)' are handled impeccably. The inclusion of the English terms in parentheses for clarity (e.g., fine-tuning, grounding) is a thoughtful touch that enhances understanding for a tech-savvy audience.
