    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally easy to understand, and the concepts are explained clearly. However, some grammatical errors, such as 'Las conocimientos' instead of 'Los conocimientos', and 'una nueva y más flexible enfoque' instead of 'un nuevo y más flexible enfoque', slightly hinder perfect readability. The inconsistent use of formal ('ustedes') and informal ('tú') address also creates minor distractions for the reader.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While much of the translation flows naturally, there are several instances that disrupt the rhythm and naturalness. The repeated grammatical errors, the awkward phrasing like 'Eso es por lo que' (instead of 'Por eso'), and the direct translation of 'Ella' for the AI (e.g., 'Ella olvida todo') feel less idiomatic in Spanish. The inconsistent use of 'tú' and 'ustedes' throughout the podcast, particularly when addressing the audience, significantly impacts the naturalness and professionalism of the dialogue. The mistranslation of 'antisèche' is a major fluency drawback.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are handled well, such as 'pre-entrenamiento' (though 'preentrenamiento' is preferred as one word, and was inconsistently applied), 'afinamiento' for fine-tuning, 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto', and 'anclaje'. However, the term 'antisèche' (French for cheat sheet) is used directly in the Spanish translation, which is not a Spanish word and should have been translated to 'chuleta', 'acordeón', or a similar term depending on regional preference, or 'ayuda de memoria'. This is a notable error in technical terminology.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation successfully maintains the conversational and explanatory tone appropriate for a podcast. The analogies used in the original French are preserved effectively. The primary issue affecting contextual adaptation is the inconsistent use of formal versus informal address, which can confuse the intended relationship between the speakers and the audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original text has been conveyed without any noticeable omissions. The translation accurately reflects the source content, and no extraneous information was added.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is generally capable of conveying the technical concepts of the podcast, and much of the conversational tone is retained. However, it is marred by several significant issues. Grammatical errors, particularly with gender agreement (e.g., 'Las conocimientos', 'una enfoque'), and less natural phrasing occur frequently enough to detract from the quality. The inconsistent use of formal and informal address ('tú' vs. 'ustedes') creates an unprofessional impression for a public-facing podcast. The most glaring terminology error is the direct use of 'antisèche' without translation. Addressing these points would significantly improve the overall quality, elevating it from a mostly understandable text to a polished and professional one."
