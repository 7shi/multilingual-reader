    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation suffers from significant inconsistencies in the use of informal singular (tú) and formal plural (ustedes) address forms throughout the dialogue. This frequent switching makes the text sound unnatural and disjointed. Additionally, there are a few awkward phrases like \"Mira, mejor:\" and misuses of idioms, such as \"fichar para un examen\" for 'cramming' ('bachoter'), which should be 'empollar' or 'estudiar de memoria'. The term \"bachotaje\" is a direct calque from French and is not natural in Spanish for 'cramming'.",

    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms like \"pre-entrenamiento,\" \"aprendizaje por transferencia,\" \"ventana de contexto,\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL) are correctly translated and consistently used. However, there is an initial inconsistency with \"afinamiento\" for 'fine-tuning', which later correctly switches to the more common \"ajuste fino.\" While \"afinamiento\" is not incorrect, the lack of consistency and preference for a less common term initially impacts the score.",

    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and purpose of the original text are conveyed, but the inconsistent addressing of the listener (tú vs. ustedes) creates an uneven tone that detracts from the podcast's natural flow and audience engagement. The incorrect idiom for 'cramming' also slightly hinders full contextual adaptation.",

      "reasoning": "All important information from the original text has been conveyed without any omissions. No redundant information has been added, and the content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate in terms of conveying information but struggles significantly with fluency and naturalness in Spanish. The most notable issue is the inconsistent use of 'tú' and 'ustedes' when addressing the listener, which creates a disjointed reading experience. There are also a few instances of unnatural phrasing and incorrect idiomatic expressions. While technical terms are mostly handled well, an initial inconsistency with 'fine-tuning' and the unnatural translation of 'bachotage' impact the quality. The text is readable and complete in terms of information, but the fluency issues detract from its overall quality."
