    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally understandable, but frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent terminology (including untranslated French terms) significantly hinder smooth readability. A Spanish reader would likely stumble over several sentences and might misunderstand key concepts due to mistranslations.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation suffers from numerous literal translations from French, leading to unnatural expressions in Spanish (e.g., \"bienvenido en\", \"se ataque a\", \"ella olvida todo\", \"ninguna idea\"). The consistent use of the formal \"usted\" form, while grammatically correct, often feels stiff for a conversational podcast setting. The retention of French terms like \"antisèche\" further detracts from natural flow.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "This is the weakest area. Key technical terms like \"pré-entraînement\" and \"l'affinage\" are repeatedly left in French, which is unacceptable for a professional translation. While \"Preentrenamiento\" and \"afinamiento\" appear correctly later for Camille's lines, the inconsistency is a major flaw. The most critical error is the mistranslation of \"bachotage\" (cramming) as \"bacheo\" (pothole repair), which completely distorts a central concept. \"Antisèche\" is also left untranslated. The pluralization of \"información\" as \"informaciones\" is consistently awkward.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational and explanatory intent of the original podcast is partially lost due to the overly formal tone and stiff phrasing. The numerous literal translations and terminology issues detract from the ease with which complex concepts should be explained in a podcast format. The translation does not fully adapt to the natural conversational style of a Spanish podcast.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original text appears to be present, with no significant omissions or additions. However, the clarity and effective conveyance of some information are compromised due to critical terminology errors (like \"bacheo\") and awkward grammatical constructions.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation provides a basic rendition of the source text, retaining most of the information. However, its quality is significantly hampered by pervasive issues in naturalness, grammatical accuracy, and most notably, technical terminology. Key terms are inconsistently translated or left in French, and a major conceptual term is completely mistranslated. The formal tone is often unsuitable for a podcast, leading to a stiff and unnatural reading experience for a native Spanish speaker. While the content is largely complete, the overall quality falls short due to these recurrent errors."
