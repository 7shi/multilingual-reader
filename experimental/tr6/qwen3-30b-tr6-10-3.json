    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is severely hampered by extensive hallucinations. Large portions of the dialogue, especially Luc's lines, are replaced with irrelevant phrases, system prompts, or generic responses (e.g., '¡Hola, mundo!', 'El resultado final es una traducción en español.'). This makes it impossible for a reader to follow the conversation or understand the technical concepts being discussed. The coherence is completely broken.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Due to the numerous and pervasive hallucinations, the translated text lacks any natural flow or coherence. It reads as a collection of disjointed, often nonsensical, phrases rather than a natural dialogue between two speakers. The rhythm and conversational tone of the original are entirely lost.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While some technical terms like 'preentrenamiento' and 'anclaje' are correctly translated when they do appear, the vast majority of the technical discussion (e.g., fine-tuning, transfer learning, in-context learning, context window) is omitted or obscured by hallucinations. Therefore, the overall handling of terminology is a catastrophic failure despite a few accurate instances.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text's intent to explain complex AI concepts in an accessible podcast format is completely lost. The translation fails to convey the purpose of the dialogue, as critical explanations and analogies are replaced with irrelevant text. There is no adaptation to the conversational context; instead, the context is entirely destroyed.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation suffers from massive information loss. Almost all of Luc's lines and several of Camille's lines are replaced by text that bears no relation to the original content. Key concepts, explanations, and analogies that form the core of the podcast episode are omitted, rendering the translation functionally empty of the original information.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation is critically flawed due to widespread hallucinations. A significant portion of the original text has been replaced by irrelevant phrases, generic responses, or what appear to be internal system prompts from the translation model itself. This completely destroys the coherence, meaning, and informational value of the original dialogue. The translated text is unreadable, not fluent, and fails to convey almost any of the original information or context. It is an unusable translation."
