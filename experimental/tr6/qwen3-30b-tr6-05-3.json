    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is severely fragmented with numerous lines replaced by instructions, meta-comments, or unrelated phrases (e.g., 'El texto traducido al español es el siguiente.', 'Hola', 'El texto proporcionado no contiene una traducción al español que extraer.'). While individual translated sentences are mostly understandable, the complete absence of a coherent dialogue makes the entire text unreadable and incomprehensible as a translation of the original podcast script. It's impossible to follow the conversation's flow or the explanation of AI concepts.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The fluency is completely compromised by the numerous interruptions and missing segments. The translated parts, when isolated, might sound somewhat natural, but the overall text does not flow at all due to the severe fragmentation. It reads like a disjointed series of unrelated statements and instructions, not a natural conversation.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Some of the core technical terms that *were* actually translated, such as 'pre-entraînement' to 'preentrenamiento', 'affinage' to 'ajuste fino', 'apprentissage par transfert' to 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'fenêtre de contexte' to 'ventana de contexto', and 'apprentissage en contexte' to 'aprendizaje contextual', are correctly rendered. However, the vast majority of the explanations and contextual usage of these terms are missing, making a full assessment of terminology application impossible. The correct translation of a few isolated terms does not compensate for the pervasive data loss.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation entirely fails to convey the original intent, purpose, or context of the podcast dialogue. Key explanations, analogies, and conversational exchanges are replaced by irrelevant text or instructions, making it impossible to understand the discussion about AI learning processes. The dialogue's natural progression and the interplay between Camille and Luc are completely lost.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This is the most critical failure point. A significant portion of the original text's information is entirely missing. Numerous lines of the French dialogue are replaced with meta-instructions ('El texto traducido al español es el siguiente.') or simple greetings ('Hola') instead of their actual Spanish translation. This results in the loss of almost all the detailed explanations about AI pre-training, fine-tuning, transfer learning, in-context learning, and memory mechanisms, rendering the translation extremely incomplete and practically useless.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation is fundamentally flawed due to extreme information incompleteness. The majority of the original French dialogue is missing, replaced by instructions or unrelated phrases in Spanish. While a few isolated technical terms are correctly translated, the overall text is fragmented, incoherent, and fails completely to convey the content, intent, or flow of the original podcast. It cannot be considered a functional translation."
