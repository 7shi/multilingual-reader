    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally understandable, but some phrasing feels slightly unnatural or overly literal, occasionally requiring the reader to pause. Inconsistencies in terminology (e.g., \"aprendizaje previo\" vs \"entrenamiento previo\") and the use of different address forms (tú, ustedes, vosotros) can be distracting. The significant error of \"AIC\" for ICL is a major detractor for technical readability, as it could confuse an informed reader.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation struggles with naturalness in several places. There are grammatical errors (\"las nuevas conocimientos\"), awkward phrasing (\"evolucionar para volverse tan avanzados\", \"con conocimiento de las mismas informaciones\"), and an inconsistent use of address forms (tú, ustedes, vosotros) throughout the dialogue, which is highly unnatural for a podcast transcript. The addition of \"o mejor dicho, consume\" and the slightly overly formal \"con el fin de aprender\" also affect the flow. The use of \"chuleta\" is too informal and contextually inappropriate for a general audience.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "This is a major weakness. Key technical terms like \"pré-entraînement\" and \"affinage\" are translated inconsistently (\"aprendizaje previo\" / \"entrenamiento previo\", \"ajuste fino\" / \"afinamiento\"). Most critically, \"ICL (In-Context Learning)\" is incorrectly translated as \"AIC\", which is a serious factual error as it misrepresents the acronym and could confuse a technically informed reader. While \"ventana de contexto\" and \"anclaje\" are correct, the significant errors and inconsistencies in other core terms severely impact the score.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational tone of the podcast is mostly maintained, and the analogies are generally well-translated. The initial greeting is well-adapted. However, the inconsistent use of address forms (tú, ustedes, vosotros) detracts from a cohesive and natural listener experience, failing to adapt consistently to a target Spanish-speaking audience. The informal \"chuleta\" is also a misstep in tone for this context.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the information is conveyed, but there are minor omissions, such as \"Précisément.\" before \"Le modèle lui-même n'apprend pas...\" and \"Donc,\" before \"la grande question...\". There is also an unnecessary addition: \"o mejor dicho, consume\". The grammatical error \"las nuevas conocimientos\" impacts the accuracy of information transmission, and the mistranslation of ICL to AIC is a significant factual inaccuracy.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation provides a general understanding of the original content but suffers from notable inconsistencies in terminology and grammatical errors, particularly concerning gender agreement and pronoun usage. The most significant issue is the incorrect translation of \"ICL\" to \"AIC,\" which severely impacts technical accuracy. While some parts flow well, the overall fluency is hampered by awkward phrasing and a lack of consistent addressing of the audience, which would be distracting in a podcast format. Several opportunities for more natural and precise Spanish were missed."
