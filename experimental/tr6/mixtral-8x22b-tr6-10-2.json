    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally understandable, but several minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasings detract from perfect readability. The inconsistent use of formal and informal 'you' (tú/usted/ustedes) within the dialogue creates a slightly disjointed flow. Errors like 'Por qué' instead of 'Porque' and 'las informaciones' instead of 'la información' or 'los datos' are noticeable. Missing question marks and quotation marks also slightly impede a smooth reading experience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation often sounds natural, but it is hampered by inconsistencies in the level of formality (tú/usted/ustedes) throughout the dialogue, which makes it less smooth and natural for a native speaker. Some word choices, such as 'registra' for 'se souvient' or 'en la invitación' for 'prompt', are either incorrect or less idiomatic, leading to awkwardness. The omission of some phrases also affects the overall flow.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Many core technical terms like 'preentrenamiento', 'ajuste fino' (mostly), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto', and 'anclaje' are correctly identified and used. However, there are critical errors: 'registra' for 'se souvient' (remembers) is a mistranslation that fundamentally changes the meaning of how AI interacts with information. 'En la invitación' for 'dans le prompt' is a literal translation that is incorrect in the technical context of AI prompts. 'Habilidades' is used instead of 'conocimientos' for 'connaissances', which alters the meaning from 'knowledge' to 'skills'. These errors, though few, are significant.",

    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text's intent of explaining AI learning processes in an accessible podcast format is mostly conveyed. However, the inconsistent formal/informal address creates an uneven tone, failing to consistently adapt the speaker-listener relationship to standard Spanish podcast conventions where a consistent 'ustedes' or 'usted' is usually maintained for an audience, and a consistent 'tú' or 'usted' for dialogue between hosts. The mistranslation of 'se souvient' also means the nuance of AI's temporary 'memory' isn't fully captured, affecting the core message.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "There are significant omissions in the translation. Two complete sentences are missing: 'Il apprendra le français à une vitesse incroyable.' and 'Il ne part pas de zéro ; il s'appuie sur des fondations extrêmement solides.' Additionally, an exclamation ('Exactement !') is omitted once. These omissions remove key pieces of information and arguments from the original text, impacting the completeness of the message conveyed to the reader.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation provides a generally understandable rendition of the source text, effectively conveying the main concepts of AI learning. However, it is significantly undermined by several critical issues. Notable problems include the omission of important sentences, leading to a loss of information, and key mistranslations of technical terms ('registra' for 'remembers', 'invitación' for 'prompt') that alter the original meaning. Grammatical errors (e.g., 'Por qué' for 'Porque', 'informaciones' for 'información') and inconsistent use of formal/informal address further detract from the overall fluency and naturalness. Punctuation errors (missing question marks and quotes) also contribute to a less polished final product. While many technical terms are translated correctly, the presence of these errors impacts the accuracy, completeness, and professional quality of the translation."
