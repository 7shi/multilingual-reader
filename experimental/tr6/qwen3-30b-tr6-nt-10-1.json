    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentence structures are logical, and complex concepts are explained well. However, there are minor points that prevent a perfect score: the use of 'Ella' (she) to refer to the AI (Luc:6, Camille:25, Luc:26) can be slightly unnatural in Spanish, where 'la IA' or 'el modelo' would be more common for an inanimate object. There is also a missing period at the end of Luc's sentence in segment 4, and an unnecessary comma in Camille's question in segment 29.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely fluent and sounds natural. Many idiomatic expressions are well-rendered, such as 'estudiar a última hora' for 'bachoter' (Camille:24) and 'no tiene ni idea' for 'n'a aucune idée' (Camille:33), and 'tras bambalinas' for 'en coulisses' (Luc:38). However, the repeated use of 'ella' for AI slightly breaks the natural flow. Additionally, 'estas informaciones' (Luc:23) is less natural than 'esta información' as 'información' is typically uncountable and singular in Spanish. The comma before 'para siempre' (Camille:29) is also stylistically awkward.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled excellently. 'Pré-entraînement' is consistently translated as 'preentrenamiento', 'affinage' as 'ajuste fino', 'apprentissage par transfert' as 'aprendizaje por transferencia', and 'fenêtre de contexte' as 'ventana de contexto'. The English equivalents provided in parentheses in the original text (e.g., 'fine-tuning', 'grounding', 'In-Context Learning') are also consistently retained or adapted appropriately ('Aprendizaje en Contexto'). 'Consultant temporaire' as 'consultor temporario' is a good specific choice. The use of 'chatbots' is appropriate as it's a common loanword in Spanish.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation effectively conveys the original podcast's conversational and informative tone. Cultural nuances are well-managed, such as translating 'structure de phrase' to 'estructura de oración' (Camille:13) for linguistic precision, and 'fenêtre de discussion' to 'ventana de chat' (Camille:33) for contextual relevance in technology. The adaptation of 'antisèche' to 'ficha de resumen' (Camille:39) is a strong example of adapting informal French to appropriate Spanish terminology. The consistent use of 'usted' verb forms for formal 'vous' is suitable for the podcast format. However, the use of 'estas informaciones' instead of 'esta información' (Luc:23) is a minor oversight in adapting an uncountable noun.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original French text is conveyed in the Spanish translation without omission. The length and detail of the Spanish text accurately reflect the source content. No redundant information is present, and the translation remains concise and clear. Appropriate supplements, such as keeping English terms in parentheses where the original did, are correctly maintained to aid understanding.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "This is a high-quality translation that demonstrates strong proficiency in both French and Spanish, particularly within the domain of AI and technology. The translator successfully captures the conversational yet informative tone of the podcast. Technical terminology is handled exceptionally well, maintaining accuracy and consistency throughout. While generally fluent and natural, there are a few minor instances where grammatical choices (like the personification of AI as 'ella' or the pluralization of 'información') slightly detract from perfect naturalness. Overall, it's an excellent piece of work that effectively communicates the original content."
