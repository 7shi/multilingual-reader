    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The sentence structure is generally logical and easy to follow, allowing for clear understanding of the concepts. However, the inconsistent speaker labels (e.g., \"Luc: Luc:\", \"Camille: Camille:\") are distracting and the fluctuating use of formal and informal address can be jarring, slightly impeding a completely smooth reading experience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The most significant issue affecting fluency is the inconsistent use of formal (\"usted\") and informal (\"tú,\" \"vos,\" \"ustedes\" plural) address throughout the text. The translation establishes a formal tone early on, but then frequently switches, sometimes within the same speaker's dialogue (e.g., using \"afinás\" and \"modificás\" instead of \"afina\" and \"modifica\"; \"tus conversaciones\" instead of \"sus conversaciones\"). This creates an unnatural and inconsistent flow for native speakers. Some minor phrasing like \"Es pues\" could also be more commonly rendered as \"Es entonces\" or \"Es por tanto\" for a more natural sound.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are appropriately handled and translated correctly for the target audience (e.g., \"pre-entrenamiento,\" \"aprendizaje por transferencia,\" \"ventana de contexto,\" \"aprendizaje en contexto,\" \"anclaje\"). The term \"prompt\" is correctly maintained as it's common in tech. There is a minor inconsistency in using both \"ajuste fino\" and \"afinamiento\" for 'fine-tuning,' although both are understandable. The translation of \"antisèche\" as \"una especie de apoyo\" is acceptable but loses some of the specific 'cheat sheet' nuance.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text's informative and slightly conversational podcast style is generally conveyed. The analogies used are clear and remain effective in Spanish. However, the significant inconsistency in addressing the listener (switching between formal and informal 'usted/tú/vos/ustedes') directly impacts the intended tone and audience relationship, which is a crucial aspect of contextual adaptation in Spanish. The omission of \"n'est-ce pas ?\" also slightly reduces the conversational feel of one of Camille's lines.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "There is one notable omission: a significant part of Luc's sentence explaining fine-tuning, \"C'est comme envoyer ce diplômé suivre une spécialisation\" (This is like sending that graduate for a specialization), is missing from the translation. This removes an important explanatory analogy. Additionally, a minor conversational element, \"n'est-ce pas ?\", is omitted from one of Camille's questions, though this doesn't impact core information.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully conveys the core technical information and main concepts of the podcast episode. The choice of technical terms is largely accurate and appropriate. However, the overall quality is significantly hampered by pervasive inconsistencies in the use of formal versus informal address (usted/tú/vos/ustedes) throughout the dialogue, which makes the text sound unnatural and less professional for a Spanish-speaking audience. Furthermore, a crucial explanatory sentence is entirely omitted, and there are minor formatting issues with speaker labels. Addressing these fluency and completeness issues would substantially improve the translation's quality and naturalness."
