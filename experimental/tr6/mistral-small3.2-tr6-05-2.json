    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally understandable, and complex concepts are explained clearly with good analogies. However, the inconsistent use of 'tú', 'usted', and 'ustedes' forms of address creates a jarring experience for the reader and detracts from the overall flow and ease of reading. Some sentences are also a bit more formal than necessary for a podcast, like the frequent use of 'Por lo tanto'.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation suffers from several fluency issues. The most prominent is the inconsistent use of 'tú' (e.g., 'Puedes tomar', 'comienzas', 'tus') and 'usted' (e.g., 'usted proporciona', 'hablarle') and 'ustedes' (e.g., 'Imaginen', 'abren') when addressing the listener. This is highly unnatural in Spanish. There are also two clear omissions of introductory words ('Exactement.' and 'Précisément.') which affect the conversational rhythm. A grammatical error ('no se afinada' instead of 'no se afina' or 'no es afinada') further impacts naturalness. Some phrases like 'Miren:' for 'Voyez plutôt' or 'hasta pronto para el próximo episodio' could be more natural.",

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The technical terminology is handled very well. Terms like 'preentrenamiento', 'afinamiento (ajuste fino)', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto', and 'anclaje (grounding)' are correctly translated and often include the English term in parentheses for clarity, which is appropriate for a technical podcast. Idiomatic translations like 'empollar' for 'bachoter' and 'chuleta' for 'antisèche' are excellent.",

    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text's intent and purpose, which is to explain AI concepts in an accessible podcast format, are largely conveyed. The use of analogies is maintained. However, the inconsistent address to the listener (tú/usted/ustedes) undermines the conversational and engaging tone expected in a podcast, making it feel less adapted to the target audience and context. The slightly formal phrasing in some parts also clashes with the casual podcast setting.",

    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "While most of the information is present, there are two noticeable omissions of single words ('Exactement.' and 'Précisément.') from Luc's dialogue. Additionally, 'les informations' in French, when referring to general information, is usually translated as 'la información' (singular) in Spanish, not 'las informaciones' (plural), which appears several times in the text. This is a minor inaccuracy but affects completeness in terms of correct noun usage.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully conveys the technical content and the overall structure of the podcast. Its main strengths are the accurate and contextually appropriate translation of technical terms and the effective use of idiomatic expressions. However, the translation is significantly hampered by a lack of consistency in the form of address (shifting between 'tú', 'usted', and 'ustedes'), which makes the dialogue feel unnatural and detracts from the conversational tone. There are also a couple of minor omissions of interjections and a grammatical error that affect fluency. Addressing these issues, particularly the pronoun consistency, would greatly improve the naturalness and polish of the text."
