    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally understandable, but inconsistencies in speaker attribution (e.g., 'Camille: \"Camille: Hola...\"', 'Luc: Luc dice: **Exactamente.**') disrupt the flow. Some sentences, while grammatically correct, feel a bit heavy or less natural than they could be, requiring the reader to re-read to fully grasp the intended meaning, especially regarding the 'bachotaje' analogy, which is confusing.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation struggles with naturalness in several places. The use of 'bienvenida/o' in a podcast intro is clunky; 'Soy Camille' is more natural than 'Yo soy Camille'. The most significant issue is the misinterpretation and awkward rendering of 'bachoter' as 'hacer bachotaje', which does not convey the meaning of 'cramming for an exam' in Spanish and sounds very unnatural, almost like 'doing high school'. Other phrases like 'no necesita rehacer el aprendizaje' instead of 'no necesita reaprender' or 'la solicitud' instead of 'el prompt' also detract from the natural flow.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "There are notable inconsistencies and suboptimal choices. 'Affinage' is translated as 'especialización' at one point and then correctly as 'afinamiento' later, which creates confusion. 'Ancrage' (grounding) is translated as 'referenciación', which, while understandable, is not the most common or precise term in the AI/ML context; 'anclaje' or 'grounding' would be more standard. The misunderstanding of 'bachoter' (cramming for an exam), translating it as 'hacer bachotaje' (doing high school/bachelor's), is a significant terminological misstep that undermines a key analogy. 'La solicitud' for 'prompt' is also imprecise.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall tone of an informative podcast is somewhat maintained. However, the issues with fluency and terminology, particularly the misinterpretation of 'bachoter', mean that the crucial explanation of AI learning (temporary vs. permanent knowledge) is not as effectively conveyed as it could be. The clarity that the original French podcast aims for is diminished by these issues in the Spanish translation. The analogy of 'consultant temporaire ou d'un expert permanent' is well preserved, but the core explanation preceding it is weakened.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original text appears to be present in the translation. There are no significant omissions or additions that alter the core message. The explanations, despite some terminological and fluency issues, largely cover the same ground as the original, ensuring the informational content is complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation provides a largely complete transfer of information, but its quality is significantly hampered by issues in fluency and terminology. Several instances of unnatural phrasing and incorrect or inconsistent technical terms, most notably the misinterpretation of 'bachoter' (cramming for an exam) and the inconsistent translation of 'affinage' (fine-tuning), detract from the overall clarity and professional polish expected for a tech podcast. The presentation is also affected by inconsistent speaker attribution. While the core message is conveyed, these issues make the translation less engaging and sometimes confusing for a native Spanish speaker interested in technology."
