    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The presence of large, duplicated blocks of text, explicitly marked with '**Traducción final:**', severely disrupts the flow and makes the translation very difficult to follow. Beyond this major structural issue, there are also grammatical errors (e.g., 'modelar nuestro mundo' instead of 'modela'), awkward phrasing ('estas informaciones', 'toda la fuerza de este enfoque'), and some gender agreement mistakes ('la equilibrio') that further hinder clear understanding for a native Spanish speaker, despite individual sentences often being comprehensible.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation frequently sounds unnatural due to direct literal translations, grammatical errors (e.g., incorrect verb conjugations, missing articles), and odd phrasing. The repeated sections are a major detractor from fluency, as they create jarring and illogical interruptions. Vocabulary choices like 'guía' for 'antisèche' miss the idiomatic nuance, and the redundancy of '¡Hasta pronto!' after 'hasta el próximo episodio' is awkward. The typo 'conoscencias' for 'conocimientos' also impacts naturalness.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most key technical terms such as 'preentrenamiento', 'ajuste fino' (fine-tuning), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto' (ICL), and 'anclaje' (grounding) are translated correctly and align with common usage in Spanish tech discourse. However, the translation of 'prompt' as 'solicitud' is acceptable but 'prompt' is often retained in tech contexts. 'Antisèche' (cheat sheet) translated as 'guía' is less precise than 'chuleta' or 'resumen' might have been in an informal context. The repeated use of 'informaciones' instead of the more common singular 'información' when referring to data is also a minor flaw.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails significantly in contextual adaptation due to the inclusion of duplicated translated segments explicitly marked with '**Traducción final:**' and, in one instance, including the original French speaker's name ('Luc: **Traducción final:** Luc:'). These are not errors of linguistic adaptation but rather severe errors in the generation or presentation of the translation, making the output unusable as a coherent podcast transcript. While the general tone of a tech podcast is somewhat maintained in the non-duplicated segments, this fundamental structural flaw prevents the translation from effectively conveying the original text's intent or being suitable for the target audience.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "While all information from the original text is present, the translation suffers from critical redundancy. Several paragraphs are duplicated, sometimes with minor variations or concatenated, leading to a text that is much longer and more confusing than the original. This severe redundancy undermines clarity, conciseness, and the ability of the reader to follow the information presented logically. The failure to eliminate repeated information significantly detracts from the overall quality of information completeness.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is severely compromised by major structural issues, particularly the repeated, marked blocks of text that make it difficult to read and understand. Beyond these critical flaws, the linguistic quality is inconsistent, with frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and suboptimal vocabulary choices affecting both readability and fluency. While some technical terms are handled correctly, the overall presentation and execution fall short of a professional standard, rendering the translation impractical for its intended purpose."
