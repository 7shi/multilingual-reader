    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is severely impaired by the inclusion of extensive meta-commentary, English phrases, and fragmented Spanish segments. This makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to read as a continuous, comprehensible translation. The reader has to actively filter out noise to find the actual translated content, which violates the core principle of readability.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While some individual translated sentences are grammatically correct and flow reasonably well, the overall fluency is destroyed by the constant interruptions of meta-comments, repetitions of speaker names, and extraneous text. Even within the intended Spanish translation, there are several typos (\"verbe,\" \"donta,\" \"para recuerda\"), an untranslated French term (\"antisèche\"), and slightly awkward phrasing (e.g., \"Exhibe exactamente esa actitud,\" \"conocimiento de las mismas informaciones\"), which detract from naturalness.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms like \"aprendizaje por transferencia,\" \"afinación,\" \"ventana de contexto,\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are generally handled correctly and appropriately for the technical context. However, there's inconsistency in translating \"pré-entraînement\" (\"etapa inicial de aprendizaje\" vs. \"preentrenamiento\"). The term \"ancrage\" is kept, with \"grounding\" in parentheses, which is acceptable for clarity but could have a more common Spanish equivalent in this context. A significant issue is leaving \"antisèche\" untranslated in one instance, which is a technical oversight within a technical discussion.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation completely fails to adapt to the context of a podcast dialogue. Instead of a seamless conversation, it presents a fragmented mix of translation attempts, internal notes, and English phrases. The tone of a lively discussion is entirely lost. A critical contextual failure is the hallucination of an unrelated sentence for Luc's line (\"¡Te espero a las siete, Lucy!\"), which entirely misrepresents the original intent. The omission of key dialogue elements, especially the concluding remarks, further damages the contextual integrity.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The information is incomplete due to several significant omissions (e.g., parts of Camille's ninth line, Luc's penultimate line, Camille's final line). More critically, there is a complete hallucination for one of Luc's lines, introducing entirely new and irrelevant information while omitting the original content. The inclusion of meta-commentary and English also obscures the actual translated information.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "overall_comment": "This submission is not a usable translation. It is a compilation of fragmented translation attempts, meta-comments, instructions, and even hallucinations, rather than a coherent translated text. Key sections are missing, and fundamental errors in content and presentation make it impossible to assess as a finished product. It fails on almost all evaluation criteria due to its structural and content inconsistencies."
