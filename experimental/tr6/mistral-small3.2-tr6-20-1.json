    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally easy to understand at a semantic level. However, the frequent shifts between formal and informal address forms (ustedes/tú) and occasional awkward phrasing like \"un recientemente graduado\" or \"conocimientos generales inmensos\" disrupt the flow. Several missing punctuation marks (periods, question marks) also create minor hesitations for the reader.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The most significant issue is the inconsistent use of \"tú\" and \"usted/ustedes\" forms throughout the dialogue, which sounds highly unnatural and jarring to a native Spanish speaker in a podcast context. This is a critical fluency breakdown. Additionally, the recurring use of \"informaciones\" instead of the singular \"información\" is an unidiomatic error. While vocabulary choices are mostly appropriate, these grammatical and usage inconsistencies severely detract from the naturalness.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are translated accurately and consistently, such as \"preentrenamiento,\" \"ajuste fino,\" \"aprendizaje por transferencia,\" \"ventana de contexto,\" \"anclaje,\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL).\" The translation correctly identifies standard Spanish equivalents for these concepts, demonstrating good understanding of the domain-specific language.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and explanatory nature of the podcast are maintained. The analogies used in the original French are effectively transferred, preserving the educational and engaging tone. However, the inconsistent addressing of the audience (switching between formal \"ustedes\" and informal \"tú\") represents a significant failure in contextual adaptation, as it creates an inappropriate and confusing register for a public broadcast. The slight misinterpretation of Camille's rhetorical question in segment 23 also indicates a minor lapse.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The vast majority of the original content is present in the translation. There are a couple of minor omissions, specifically the word \"Exactement\" at the beginning of two of Luc's turns, and the nuance of \"oublié\" being in quotes in segment 34. While these are minor, they do represent a slight loss of fidelity to the source text. No major information is missing or misrepresented.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation accurately conveys most of the technical information and main concepts, demonstrating a good understanding of the source content. Key technical terms are well-translated and consistent. However, the quality is significantly hampered by inconsistent address forms (\"tú\" vs. \"usted/ustedes\"), which is a major fluency and contextual adaptation issue for a Spanish audience in this type of setting. There are also several minor grammatical errors (e.g., \"informaciones\" instead of \"información\") and missing punctuation that affect readability and overall professionalism. With a consistent addressing style and correction of minor grammatical flaws, this translation could be of high quality."
