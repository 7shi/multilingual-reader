    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally understandable, and the sentence structures are mostly logical. However, there are a few grammatical errors, such as 'Las nuevas conocimientos' (should be 'Los nuevos conocimientos') and 'La IA no se afinada' (should be 'no se afina' or 'no es afinada'). Additionally, the inconsistent use of formal ('usted') and informal ('tú') forms of address, especially from Luc's dialogue, can be jarring and slightly hinder a smooth reading experience, as the original French 'vous' is consistently formal.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While many parts of the translation flow naturally, some phrases feel like direct literal translations from French, leading to slightly awkward expressions in Spanish. The inconsistent formality ('usted' vs. 'tú') is the most significant detractor, making the dialogue sound less natural and professional for a podcast. For instance, 'Ella procesa una cantidad masiva de datos' for 'Elle lit' could be 'Ella lee' for better accuracy and flow. The use of 'anclada' for 'ancrée' in the bike analogy is acceptable but 'arraigada' or 'interiorizada' might sound more idiomatic in that specific context.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The translation excels in handling technical terminology. Terms like 'pré-entraînement' (preentrenamiento), 'affinage' (afinamiento), 'apprentissage par transfert' (aprendizaje por transferencia), 'fenêtre de contexte' (ventana de contexto), 'apprentissage en contexte' (aprendizaje en contexto, ICL), and 'ancrage' (anclaje) are accurately and consistently translated. The inclusion of the English terms in parentheses, mirroring the original, further enhances clarity and precision for the target audience.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text's intent as an informative podcast is largely conveyed. The analogies and explanations are well-preserved and remain clear. However, the inconsistent formal/informal register ('usted' vs. 'tú') significantly detracts from the professional and consistent tone expected in a podcast, where the original 'vous' maintains a formal distance. The original uses speaker names only when the speaker changes; the translation sometimes adds names unnecessarily (e.g., 'Luc: Y me llamo Luc' instead of just 'Y me llamo Luc' as in the source's implied change of speaker from Camille).",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French text has been successfully conveyed in the Spanish translation. There are no notable omissions or misinterpretations of the core concepts or details discussed in the podcast. The explanations are as comprehensive as in the source, ensuring the reader receives all intended information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation accurately conveys the technical information and main concepts, demonstrating a strong understanding of the specialized vocabulary. However, its overall quality is hampered by inconsistent fluency, a few grammatical errors, and, most significantly, a lack of consistent formality in the address ('usted' vs. 'tú'). This inconsistency detracts from the professional tone of a podcast and affects both readability and naturalness. While the core message is clear, the execution could be smoother and more polished to match the original's natural flow and register."
