    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The readability is significantly hampered by numerous grammatical errors, awkward sentence structures, and a distracting over-reliance on bolding and incorrect quotation marks. Phrases like \"Lo que percibimos con frecuencia son estas IA como cajas negras\" and \"no ha tenido olvido\" are difficult to parse naturally. The inconsistent use of 'vosotros' and 'ustedes' for addressing the audience is also jarring and diminishes the reading experience.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation lacks naturalness in many places. There are several grammatical errors (e.g., \"Ya lo he oído hablar,\" \"amplias conocimientos,\" \"Las nuevas conocimientos,\" \"se recuerda de esas informaciones,\" \"le dar,\" \"montas en tu silla,\" \"no ha tenido olvido,\" \"No es eso una astucia\") that make the Spanish sound unnatural to a native speaker. Conversational elements and transitions from the original French (e.g., 'Exactement', 'L'affinage...', 'C'est-à-dire ?', 'Oui, et', 'On peut dire ça') are frequently omitted, leading to a stiff and abrupt dialogue.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Terminology handling is inconsistent and often inaccurate. The term 'pre-entrenamiento' is used inconsistently with and without a hyphen. The Spanish equivalent for 'apprentissage par transfert' (aprendizaje por transferencia) is omitted in favor of the English 'transfer learning.' Crucially, 'fenêtre de contexte' (context window) is completely left out of the translation, which is a significant loss of information. 'Ancrage' (grounding) is also handled by just using the English 'grounding' without its Spanish equivalent, 'ancraje' or 'fundamentación.' The translation of 'fundations' as 'fundaciones' instead of 'cimientos' or 'bases' in the context of AI architecture is incorrect, and 'antisèche' (cheat sheet) is poorly translated as 'resumen ejecutivo,' losing the informal nuance.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to fully adapt to the podcast context. The conversational flow is frequently broken by omissions of natural transitions and fillers. The excessive bolding of entire sentences or parts of sentences, along with the incorrect use of quotation marks around complete paragraphs, is highly disruptive and inappropriate for a transcript. The nuance of analogies, such as 'antisèche' being rendered as 'resumen ejecutivo,' is lost. The inconsistency in addressing the audience ('vosotros' vs. 'ustedes') also indicates a lack of clear contextual adaptation for a specific Spanish-speaking demographic.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several pieces of information and conversational cues are omitted, impacting completeness. Key definitions like 'fenêtre de contexte' (context window) are entirely missing. Explanations such as 'en coulisses' (behind the scenes) and conversational signals like 'Exactement' or 'On peut dire ça' are dropped. Adding 'Cuál es la diferencia' into a confirming question also alters the original intent. The translation of 'constitue le contexte' as 'forma parte del contexto' slightly changes the original meaning, implying a partial inclusion rather than full constitution.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation presents numerous issues across all criteria. There are significant grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and a lack of natural fluency that make the text difficult to read and less engaging than the original. Crucially, terminology is handled inconsistently, and important explanatory details and definitions are omitted. The inappropriate formatting with excessive bolding and incorrect quotation marks further detracts from the overall quality. While the general subject matter is conveyed, the translation requires substantial revision to improve accuracy, naturalness, and fidelity to the original text's tone and information."
