    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The readability is significantly hampered by multiple factors. There are untranslated French phrases (e.g., 'C'est donc', 'Merci'), which break the flow and make it difficult for a Spanish speaker to understand. A critical mistranslation like 'extraños' instead of 'extractos' creates nonsensical sentences. Furthermore, the omission of key sentence parts and entire concepts (e.g., the explanation of ICL, the full descriptions of chatbot memory scenarios) leads to a disjointed narrative where the reader has to guess at the implied meaning. The inconsistent use of 'tú' and 'usted' also creates an unnatural conversational rhythm.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation lacks naturalness and smoothness in several places. The inconsistent use of informal 'tú' and formal 'usted' within the same dialogue, and sometimes within the same speaker's lines, is jarring and unnatural for Spanish speakers. Grammatical awkwardness like 'en trasladando' (instead of 'trasladando' or 'al trasladar') and the redundancy of 'Eso es exactamente eso' detract from the natural flow. Crucially, leaving French words ('C'est donc', 'Merci') untranslated is a severe breach of fluency.",

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While some technical terms are handled correctly ('pre-entrenamiento', 'afinamiento', 'aprendizaje por transferencia'), there's an inconsistency in their application (e.g., 'entrenamiento previo' instead of 'pre-entrenamiento'). The term 'aproximación' for 'approche' is less common than 'enfoque' in this context. The translation of 'connaissance temporaire' as 'memoria a corto plazo' is an interpretation rather than a direct term. The term 'clave' for 'antisèche' (crib sheet) is inaccurate, failing to convey the original meaning. 'Aprendizaje contextual' is used inconsistently with the earlier 'aprendizaje en contexto'.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The primary issue in contextual adaptation is the inconsistent use of formal and informal address ('tú' vs 'usted'). The original French 'vous' maintains a consistent, slightly formal yet conversational tone appropriate for a podcast. The frequent switching in the Spanish translation creates an awkward and unnatural dynamic between the speakers, failing to adapt the original's communicative intent effectively. The choice of 'Rayo' for 'Éclair' in the podcast title is a good adaptation.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This is the weakest aspect of the translation. Numerous significant omissions of information occur throughout the text. Entire sentences or crucial phrases are missing, which fundamentally alters or removes key explanations and rhetorical devices. Examples include the omission of 'Exactement.', 'C'est toute la puissance de cette approche.', the complete explanation of 'apprentissage en contexte (ICL)', the latter half of Camille's sentences about chatbots and 'Memoria' features, 'Ce serait incroyablement inefficace.', and 'Précisément.'. These omissions severely impact the coherence and comprehensiveness of the translated content.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a basic understanding of the source text but suffers from significant issues in fluency, readability, and critically, information completeness. The inconsistent use of formal/informal address, grammatical awkwardness, untranslated words, and outright omissions of crucial sentences make the translated dialogue difficult to follow and understand, undermining the podcast's informative purpose. Several technical terms are handled inconsistently or inaccurately. While some parts are acceptable, the cumulative effect of the errors detracts significantly from the overall quality."
