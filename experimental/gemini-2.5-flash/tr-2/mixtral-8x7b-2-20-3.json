    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The readability is significantly hampered by several issues. The most severe is the mistranslation of \"extraits\" as \"extraños\" in Segment 11, which makes the sentence nonsensical. Additionally, the fabrication of Camille's line in Segment 3 disrupts the conversational flow and makes it hard to follow the original intent. Other minor grammatical awkwardness, such as \"integral parte\" instead of \"parte integral\" and the unnecessary \"lo\" in \"Solo lo utiliza un sistema...\", also contribute to a less smooth reading experience.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation lacks consistent naturalness. There are instances of awkward phrasing, for example, \"Aprendería de la misma manera\" at the beginning of Luc's speech in Segment 3, and \"Porque lo ha adquirido debido a su conocimiento previo...\" in Segment 4. The inconsistent use of formal and informal address (tú/usted) throughout the dialogue (e.g., \"tus conversaciones\" vs. \"usted\") is a significant detractor. The use of the English word \"approach\" instead of \"enfoque\" or \"planteamiento\" also impacts fluency.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While some technical terms like \"pre-entrenamiento,\" \"ajuste fino,\" \"aprendizaje de transferencia,\" and \"ventana de contexto\" are translated correctly, there are notable errors. \"Ancrage (grounding)\" is translated as \"ancraje,\" which is not the standard or most common term in Spanish for AI 'grounding' (where 'anclaje' or 'fundamentación' are more common), and the helpful parenthetical 'grounding' from the source is omitted. The use of \"approach\" instead of a Spanish equivalent is also a terminology miss. Most critically, the mistranslation of \"extraits\" (extracts) as \"extraños\" (strangers/strange things) in Segment 11 is a severe terminology error that fundamentally alters the meaning.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The most significant failure in contextual adaptation is the complete replacement of Camille's simple question \"C'est-à-dire ?\" (What do you mean?) with a lengthy, irrelevant, and self-referential paragraph in Segment 3. This fundamentally alters the conversational context and Camille's role. The inconsistent use of formal/informal address also demonstrates a lack of consistent adaptation to the implied audience or speaker relationship. The intent of the original dialogue is distorted by these changes.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This is the weakest criterion. The translation makes a major omission and addition error by replacing Camille's \"C'est-à-dire ?\" with an entirely different and lengthy statement in Segment 3. The mistranslation of \"extraits\" as \"extraños\" in Segment 11 is a critical distortion of information. Furthermore, the translation of \"vos anciens échanges\" (your past exchanges) as \"mis intercambios previos\" (my past exchanges) in Segment 11 directly misrepresents information. Minor redundancies and unfaithful additions (e.g., \"o durante largos periodos de tiempo,\" \"y transparente para el usuario\") also affect completeness and conciseness.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation contains several significant errors that detract from its overall quality. Key issues include the complete fabrication of one of Camille's lines, the mistranslation of a crucial technical term ('extracts' as 'strangers'), and an inconsistent use of formal/informal address. These problems severely impact information completeness, contextual adaptation, and overall readability and fluency. While some technical terms are handled correctly, the critical errors overshadow the positive aspects, resulting in a translation that often fails to accurately convey the original meaning and conversational flow."
