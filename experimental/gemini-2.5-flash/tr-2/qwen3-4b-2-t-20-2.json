    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally understandable, but several instances of awkward phrasing, stiff sentence structures, and consistent grammatical errors (especially gender agreement for 'conocimientos' and 'información') hinder the natural flow and clarity for a native Spanish speaker. The formality in places also makes it less engaging and easy to follow than a podcast script should be.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation frequently sounds unnatural. Examples include 'revelar el secreto sobre la forma' (for 'lever le voile sur la façon'), 'Mira más bien' (for 'Voyez plutôt'), and 'es como enviar a seguir una especialización' (missing a subject). The inconsistent and often overly formal use of 'usted' when addressing Camille, combined with repetitive formal connectors like 'Por lo tanto', detracts from the conversational tone of a podcast. Frequent grammatical errors, especially gender mismatches (e.g., 'las percibimos' for 'los modelos', 'las conocimientos' for 'los conocimientos', 'estos herramientas' for 'estas herramientas'), significantly impact the naturalness for a native speaker.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are translated correctly, such as 'preentrenamiento', 'afinamiento' (with 'fine-tuning' in parentheses), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto' (with ICL), and 'anclaje' (with 'grounding'). The practice of including the English term in parentheses is appropriate and helpful. However, 'bachoter' is poorly translated as 'estudiar a la vuela' (incorrect idiom) and then simplified to 'el estudio rápido' (losing the nuance of cramming). Similarly, 'antisèche' as 'breve resumen' misses the specific meaning of a 'crib sheet' or 'cheat sheet', which is crucial for the analogy.",

    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text's conversational and informative intent is partially conveyed, but the translation often misses the engaging, informal, and dynamic style typical of a podcast. The formality in word choice and address (e.g., 'Usted ha entendido todo', consistent 'Por lo tanto') creates a more didactic and less natural dialogue. The cultural context of idioms like 'bachoter' and 'antisèche' is not adequately adapted, weakening the analogies used to explain complex concepts to the audience.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French text has been transferred to the Spanish translation without significant omissions. The additions are minimal and do not distort the overall message. However, the recurring issues with readability and fluency can make it harder for the reader to fully absorb and retain all the information as clearly as intended, even if technically present.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation provides a generally complete transfer of information from French to Spanish. However, its overall quality is significantly hampered by numerous grammatical errors, particularly regarding gender agreement, and a lack of natural fluency. The tone often feels overly formal for a podcast, and some idiomatic expressions are translated literally or incorrectly, which detracts from the conversational and illustrative nature of the original. While technical terminology is mostly handled well, the cumulative effect of the grammatical and stylistic issues results in a stiff and unpolished text that would not resonate naturally with a native Spanish-speaking audience."
