    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally comprehensible, and the complex technical concepts are explained clearly, following the structure of the original French. Most sentences are logical and easy to follow. However, minor grammatical inconsistencies, such as subject-verb agreement issues (e.g., 'se percibe estas IA' instead of 'se perciben') and occasional awkward phrasing, slightly hinder the overall ease of reading, preventing a higher score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text mostly flows, but several instances sound unnatural or slightly awkward to a native Spanish speaker. There are repeated uses of 'Exactamente' where other variations could be used for better rhythm, and some literal translations from French result in less idiomatic Spanish. Specific issues include missing articles ('pre-entrenamiento' as Camille's interjection, 'aprendizaje por transferencia'), incorrect pronoun usage ('le recuerden' instead of 'te recuerden'), and verb form inconsistencies ('monta en sillín' instead of 'montas en sillín'). These issues, while not making the text incomprehensible, detract from its naturalness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The technical terminology is handled exceptionally well. Terms like 'pre-entrenamiento', 'ajuste fino' (fine-tuning), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto' (In-Context Learning), and 'anclaje' (grounding) are all translated accurately and consistently. The translator correctly mirrored the original's style of including the English equivalent in parentheses for clarity, which is excellent for a technical podcast audience. The idiomatic translation of 'bachotage' to 'estudiar de última hora' and 'antisèche' to 'hoja de resumen' is also very effective.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation successfully conveys the original text's intent and purpose as an explanatory podcast. The conversational tone, the use of analogies (university graduate, physicist, bike riding, consultant, cheat sheet), and the dynamic between Camille and Luc are all well-preserved. There are no significant cultural mismatches, and the explanations are adapted appropriately for the target audience without losing the original pedagogical intent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original French text has been accurately and completely conveyed in the Spanish translation. There are no omissions, additions, or misinterpretations of the core content. The explanations are as detailed and comprehensive as in the source, ensuring that the reader receives the full message.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation effectively conveys the technical information and the pedagogical intent of the original podcast. A strong point is the accurate and consistent handling of technical terminology, which is crucial for this type of content. However, the translation's overall quality is hampered by several grammatical inaccuracies and instances of unnatural phrasing that impact its fluency and native feel. While the meaning is generally clear, addressing these linguistic nuances related to verb agreement, pronoun usage, and idiomatic expressions would significantly enhance the polish and naturalness of the Spanish text for a podcast audience."
