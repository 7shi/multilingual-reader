    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is exceptionally clear and easy to understand. Sentence structures are logical and flow smoothly, making complex AI concepts accessible to a general audience, perfectly matching the podcast format. The language used is natural and doesn't require rereading for comprehension.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text reads like an original Spanish script. There are no instances of awkward phrasing, literal translations, or unnatural expressions. Vocabulary choices are consistently appropriate and contemporary, reflecting natural conversational Spanish, especially with excellent idiomatic adaptations like 'aprender de memoria a toda prisa' for 'bachoter' and 'unos apuntes' for 'une antisèche'.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled with great precision and consistency. 'Entrenamiento previo', 'ajuste preciso', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', and 'aprendizaje en contexto' (with the suitable acronym AIC) are all accurately and appropriately translated. The term 'fundamentación' for 'ancrage' (grounding) is a sensible choice, further clarified by the English term in parentheses. The only very minor point is that 'en coulisses' was translated to 'de forma automática' losing a slight nuance of 'behind the scenes', and '« Mémoire »' as a specific feature name could have been emphasized more strongly, but these do not significantly detract from the overall excellent terminology.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation masterfully conveys the original text's intent and purpose as an engaging and informative podcast. The conversational tone between Camille and Luc is perfectly preserved. Cultural adaptations, such as 'Miren esto' for 'Voyez plutôt' and adjusting analogies like 'montes en selle' to 'subes a la bicicleta', enhance the naturalness for the target audience. The translation feels entirely appropriate and optimized for a Spanish-speaking listener.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original French text is conveyed without any omissions. The explanations of core AI concepts, their distinctions, and analogies are fully present and clear. No unnecessary redundancies are introduced, maintaining the concise and clear nature of the original content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "This is an outstanding translation that excels in all aspects. The text reads incredibly naturally in Spanish, preserving the informative yet conversational tone of the original podcast. All technical terms are handled with precision, and idiomatic expressions are perfectly adapted. The clarity and fluency make it a highly effective and engaging piece for a Spanish-speaking audience. It's a prime example of high-quality technical translation."
