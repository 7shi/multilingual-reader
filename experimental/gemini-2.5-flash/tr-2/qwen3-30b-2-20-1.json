    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is highly readable. The sentence structures are logical and easy to follow, making complex AI concepts accessible to the target audience. The conversational flow from the original French podcast is well-preserved, ensuring a smooth reading experience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text sounds natural and fluent. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary for a technical podcast. There are no significant grammatical errors or awkward expressions that detract from the naturalness. The dialogue flows smoothly, reflecting a native-like cadence.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as 'pre-entrenamiento' (pré-entraînement), 'ajuste fino' (affinage/fine-tuning), 'aprendizaje por transferencia' (apprentissage par transfert), 'ventana de contexto' (fenêtre de contexte), and 'aprendizaje en contexto' (apprentissage en contexte) are accurately and consistently translated. The term 'prompt' is correctly kept in English as it's common usage in Spanish AI contexts. The translation of 'ancrage' as 'anclaje' is also appropriate. The only very minor inconsistency is the inclusion of '(fine-tuning)' but not '(grounding)' which was present in the original.",
