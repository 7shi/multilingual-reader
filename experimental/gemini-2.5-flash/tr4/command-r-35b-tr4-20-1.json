    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is highly readable and comprehensible. Sentence structures are logical and easy to follow, allowing for a smooth flow of information. Complex concepts are explained clearly through well-chosen vocabulary and effective analogies, making the content accessible to target language readers.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text sounds very natural and smooth to native Spanish speakers. There are no awkward grammatical constructions or unnatural expressions. Vocabulary choices are appropriate, contemporary, and fit the conversational, podcast-style tone of the original text. Examples include 'desciframos' for 'décryptons' and 'chuleta' for 'antisèche'.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled appropriately throughout the translation. Standard terms like 'preentrenamiento', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', and 'aprendizaje en contexto' are correctly used. The term 'el afinado' for 'fine-tuning' is acceptable, especially with the English term provided in parentheses as a clarification, and it is consistently applied. The adaptation of 'bachotage' to 'estudiar para un examen' and 'ancrage' to 'ancoraje' (with 'grounding' as clarification) also demonstrates a good understanding of the context.",

    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text's intent and purpose, which is to explain complex AI concepts in an accessible podcast format, are effectively conveyed in the translation. The conversational tone between Camille and Luc is well-maintained. Analogies, such as the 'young graduate' and 'learning to ride a bike', are translated in a way that preserves their clarity and impact for the target audience. Cultural background considerations are appropriate, as seen in the natural phrasing of everyday expressions.",

    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original text has been conveyed without any omissions. The translation accurately reflects the nuances of the French text, including the distinctions between temporary knowledge (ICL) and permanent skill (fine-tuning). No unnecessary redundancy is present, and the content remains concise and clear while providing all necessary information.",
