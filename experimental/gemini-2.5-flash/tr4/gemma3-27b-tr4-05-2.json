    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is exceptionally clear and easy to follow. Complex AI concepts are broken down and explained in a very digestible manner, utilizing logical sentence structures and appropriate conjunctions that aid comprehension for the target audience. The conversational flow is maintained, making the content engaging.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text reads like an original Spanish script for a podcast. There are no awkward phrases, unnatural grammatical constructions, or unsuitable vocabulary choices. The idioms and analogies (e.g., 'memorizar para un examen' for 'bachotage', 'arraigada' for 'ancrée') are handled perfectly, contributing to a highly natural and smooth flow.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms specific to AI and machine learning are consistently and accurately translated or adopted. Terms like 'pre-entrenamiento', 'ajuste fino' (fine-tuning), 'aprendizaje por transferencia' (transfer learning), 'ventana de contexto' (context window), 'aprendizaje en contexto' (in-context learning), 'anclaje' (grounding), and 'prompt' are standard in the Spanish-speaking AI community. The translation correctly uses 'preentrenamiento' as a single word.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation perfectly captures the informal yet informative tone of the original podcast. The conversational style between Camille and Luc is maintained, and all analogies and explanations are adapted effectively to resonate with a Spanish-speaking audience. The purpose of demystifying AI concepts is successfully conveyed.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original French text is accurately and completely conveyed in the Spanish translation.

      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "This is an outstanding translation. It demonstrates a profound understanding of both the source and target languages, as well as the technical subject matter.
