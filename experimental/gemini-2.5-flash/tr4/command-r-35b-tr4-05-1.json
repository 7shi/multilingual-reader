    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is very clear and easy to understand. The sentence structures are logical, maintaining the conversational flow of the original podcast. Complex AI concepts are explained in an accessible manner, making the content highly comprehensible for target language readers.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural and smooth. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary, and grammatical structures are correct. There are only a few minor instances where a slightly more idiomatic phrasing could be used, but these do not significantly detract from the overall naturalness of the text. For example, 'estudio intensivo y de último momento' for 'bachotage' and 'chivatazo' for 'antisèche' are excellent, natural choices.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled very appropriately. Concepts like 'pre-entrenamiento', 'afinamiento (fine-tuning)', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)', and 'anclaje (grounding)' are correctly translated and often include the original English term in parentheses, which is excellent for clarity and precision in a technical context. Consistency in term selection is maintained throughout the text.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation effectively conveys the original text's intent and purpose, which is to explain AI learning processes in a podcast format. The conversational and informative tone is perfectly maintained. There are no significant cultural nuances to adapt, and the expressions are well-suited for a general Spanish-speaking audience interested in technology.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original French text has been accurately conveyed without any omissions. The translation provides a complete and faithful rendition of the discussion, including all explanations and examples. No unnecessary redundancy was introduced, and the content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "This is a high-quality translation that effectively captures the essence and technical detail of the original podcast. The translator demonstrated a strong understanding of both the source and target languages, as well as the technical subject matter. Readability, terminology, and information completeness are particularly strong. Minor improvements in fluency could be made in a few isolated phrases, but overall, it's an excellent piece of work."
