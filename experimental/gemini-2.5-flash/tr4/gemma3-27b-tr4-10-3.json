    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is highly readable and easy to understand for native speakers. Sentence structures are logical and follow natural Spanish syntax. Complex concepts are clearly explained, maintaining the clarity of the original French podcast. The flow of information is smooth, making it effortless to follow the discussion.",

    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation demonstrates excellent fluency and naturalness. The language sounds entirely idiomatic and smooth, with appropriate vocabulary choices throughout.

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled exceptionally well. 'Pré-entraînement' as 'pre-entrenamiento', 'affinage' as 'ajuste fino' (with 'fine-tuning' in parentheses for clarity), 'apprentissage par transfert' as 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'fenêtre de contexte' as 'ventana de contexto', 'apprentissage en contexte' as 'aprendizaje en contexto' (with 'ICL' and 'In-Context Learning'), and 'ancrage' as 'anclaje' (with 'grounding') are all accurate and standard translations. The choice of 'guía rápida' for 'antisèche' in the context of providing documents to a consultant is a clever and appropriate adaptation.",

    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation effectively conveys the original text's intent and purpose, which is to explain complex AI concepts in an accessible podcast format.
