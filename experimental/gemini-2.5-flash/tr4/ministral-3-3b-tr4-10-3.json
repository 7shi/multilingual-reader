    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The readability is severely impacted by frequent untranslated French words and phrases (e.g., \"Et soyoy Luc\", \"Donc, después del\", \"C'est logique\", \"C'est là que interviene\"), numerous grammatical errors, particularly gender agreement issues (\"Las conocimientos\", \"los palabras\"), and inconsistent use of formal/informal address (tú/usted/ustedes). These issues make the text very disjointed and difficult to follow for a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation lacks naturalness and smoothness to a very high degree. The constant presence of French words and structures embedded within Spanish sentences breaks the flow completely. Grammatical mistakes, awkward phrasing (\"Toda la realidad del ICL\"), and repetitions (\"Camille: Camille:\") further detract from its fluency, making it sound like an unedited machine translation.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as 'pre-entrenamiento', 'afinado' (with 'ajuste fino' in parentheses), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto', 'ICL', 'anclaje', and 'prompt' are correctly translated and used. This is the strongest aspect of the translation. The term 'bachotaje' for 'bachotage' is also a good choice. 'Tech Flash' for 'Tech Éclair' is an acceptable adaptation. One minor point is 'resumen' for 'antisèche' which is a bit softer than 'cheat sheet' but generally acceptable in context.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to adapt to the target context primarily due to the severe readability and fluency issues. The informal podcast tone is undermined by the mechanical and grammatically incorrect language. The inconsistent formality (tú/usted/ustedes) is a significant contextual misstep for Spanish. Additionally, Camille's line about 'bachotaje' includes an unnecessary over-explanation not present in the original, breaking the conversational rhythm.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original text has been conveyed without significant omissions. However, there is an instance where an unnecessary explanation is added to Camille's dialogue (\"aprender a aplicar lo aprendido de manera contextualizada y no solo memorizar\"), which, while not an omission, makes the content less concise than the original.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation exhibits significant issues across most evaluation criteria, primarily due to the pervasive presence of untranslated French words and phrases, numerous grammatical errors (especially gender agreement), and inconsistent formality. While technical terminology is largely accurate, the overall quality of the Spanish prose is very poor, lacking naturalness, clarity, and fluency. It reads like a raw machine translation that has not undergone adequate post-editing. Extensive revision would be required to make it comprehensible and fluent for a native Spanish speaker."
