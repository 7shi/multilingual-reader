  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is severely hampered by the presence of untranslated segments, English intrusions, and French intrusions. This makes the text incredibly difficult for a Spanish reader to follow and understand as a coherent whole. While some individual sentences are correctly translated, the overall reading experience is extremely poor.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The constant switching between Spanish, English, and French, along with placeholder text, completely destroys any sense of natural flow or fluency. Even in the correctly translated Spanish parts, there are minor awkward phrases (e.g., 'Mas bien, vean' for 'Voyez plutôt') or grammatical imperfections (e.g., missing inverted question marks, redundant pronouns).",
      "score": 2
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Some technical terms like 'pre-entrenamiento,' 'ajuste fino' (fine-tuning), 'aprendizaje por transferencia,' 'ventana de contexto,' and 'anclaje' (grounding) are correctly translated and appropriately used. However, there's a significant error in translating 'bachoter' (to cram) as 'hacer trampas' (to cheat), which fundamentally misrepresents the concept. Additionally, the redundancy in 'ICL (Aprendizaje en contexto)' and the overall inconsistency due to partial translation prevent a higher score.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text's intent was to provide a clear, informative, and engaging explanation of AI learning processes in a podcast format. The translated text, due to its severe omissions and language mixing, utterly fails to convey this intent or provide a useful explanation to the target audience. The conversational tone is lost in the chaos of missing and mixed content.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This is the most critical failure. Several large segments of the original French text are either completely missing, replaced by developer notes like 'Spanish translation result' or 'French to Spanish translation result,' or contain intrusions from English or French text. Crucial explanations and dialogue are absent, rendering the translation profoundly incomplete.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation is severely flawed across all criteria, primarily due to significant portions of the text being untranslated, containing placeholder messages, or including intrusions from other languages (English and original French). Key paragraphs are missing entirely, making it impossible to understand the core concepts being discussed. Even in the translated sections, there are minor grammatical and lexical issues. The translation fails to fulfill its purpose of conveying information from the source text."
