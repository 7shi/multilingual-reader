    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation presents numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent punctuation (e.g., missing opening question marks, misplaced exclamation marks). A critical copy-paste error resulted in a significant block of text being repeated verbatim, severely disrupting the flow and making it difficult to follow the conversation. These issues collectively make the text challenging for a target language reader to process smoothly.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text lacks naturalness and contains many literal translations from French that sound unidiomatic in Spanish. Phrases like '¡Por lo tanto,' at the start of a sentence, 'Ved' in a podcast context, and the incorrect use of verb tenses or prepositions frequently break the natural rhythm of Spanish. The repeated paragraph further degrades fluency by creating an illogical and redundant segment.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While some core technical terms like 'pre-entrenamiento', 'ajuste' (fine-tuning), and 'aprendizaje por transferencia' are rendered correctly, there are notable inconsistencies and inaccuracies. For instance, 'ICL (Aprendizaje In-Context)' is redundant and slightly awkward, and 'bachotage' (cramming) is incorrectly translated as 'bachillerato' (high school diploma), which is a significant semantic error that distorts an important analogy. The term 'guía rápida' for 'antisèche' (crib sheet) is also less precise.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text is a casual and informative podcast. The translation struggles to adapt to this context effectively due to the numerous linguistic errors and awkward phrasing. The archaic 'Ved' is completely out of place for a modern podcast. Inconsistencies in formality (switching between 'tú' and 'usted' forms without clear reason) also detract from the intended conversational and engaging tone.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The most significant issue affecting information completeness is the direct repetition of a lengthy paragraph in Luc's dialogue, which introduces redundancy and confusion rather than clarity. Additionally, there are instances where information is slightly altered or less precisely conveyed, such as 'équilibre' (balance) becoming 'estabilidad' (stability), and the critical mistranslation of 'bachotage' changing the meaning of an analogy. While most core information is present, these errors and redundancies detract from its clear and concise delivery.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation suffers from significant quality issues across all evaluated criteria. The presence of numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and a glaring copy-paste error that repeats a large section of text severely impacts readability and fluency. Key technical terminology is sometimes mishandled, most notably with the mistranslation of 'bachotage'. The overall tone is inconsistent and does not effectively adapt to the casual podcast style of the original. Extensive revision is required to correct these errors, improve naturalness, and ensure accurate and complete information transfer."
