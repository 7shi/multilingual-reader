    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally easy to read and understand. Concepts are explained clearly, and the sentence structures are logical. However, there is an inconsistent use of formal (usted/ustedes) and informal (tú) address throughout the dialogue, which can be slightly jarring and affect the flow for a native speaker, though it does not impede overall comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly natural, but the inconsistencies in addressing the audience (shifting between 'tú', 'usted', and 'ustedes' forms) detract from its overall smoothness and naturalness. For example, 'Miren' (ustedes) is used, then 'puedes' (tú), then 'no necesita' (usted). Additionally, the use of 'informaciones' in plural instead of the more common singular 'información' is a minor unnatural usage.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The technical terminology is handled very well. Key terms like 'pre-entrenamiento', 'afinamiento' (with 'ajuste fino' provided as an alternative), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto' (ICL), and 'ancramiento' (with 'fijación' provided) are accurately translated and consistently used. 'Bachotear' for 'bachoter' is an excellent, natural choice. 'Sugerencia' for 'prompt' is acceptable, though 'prompt' itself is very common in Spanish AI contexts.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation successfully conveys the intent and purpose of the original podcast discussion. The conversational tone is maintained, and the dialogue flows as expected for an explanatory podcast. The inclusion of speaker names ('Camille:', 'Luc:') enhances clarity for a transcript. The main issue, as with fluency and readability, is the inconsistent formality when addressing the listener, which slightly diminishes the polished feel of a professional podcast.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "One significant piece of information was omitted in the translation. The original text states: 'L'IA n'est pas constamment affinée par vos conversations. Ce serait incroyablement inefficace.' This sentence is missing from the Spanish translation, which impacts the completeness, as it explains *why* the 'memory' feature works as an automated context insertion rather than true learning.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely accurate and effectively conveys the technical concepts discussed in the podcast. It excels in terminology, providing clear and often dual options for key AI terms. However, it suffers from a lack of consistency in addressing the audience (shifting between 'tú', 'usted', and 'ustedes' forms), which affects its fluency and naturalness. The most significant issue is the omission of a crucial sentence explaining the inefficiency of constant fine-tuning, impacting information completeness."
