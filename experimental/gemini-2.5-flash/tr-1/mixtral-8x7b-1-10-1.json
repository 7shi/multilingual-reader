    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The readability is severely impacted by several critical errors. There are instances where French terms like 'fenêtre de contexte' and 'ancraje' are left untranslated, making sentences incomprehensible. Most notably, an entire segment of Luc's dialogue is replaced by an English comment '2. The speaker, Luc, is expressing the idea...' which completely breaks the flow and meaning. Additionally, there are numerous grammatical inaccuracies (e.g., 'El IA' instead of 'La IA') and awkward phrasings that hinder smooth reading.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation lacks fluency and naturalness in Spanish. Many expressions are direct, literal translations from French, leading to awkward phrasing. Examples include 'la afinación' being inconsistently used with 'la tuning', 'El IA' instead of 'La IA', and 'afilando' instead of 'afinando' for 'fine-tuning'. The inclusion of untranslated French terms and the English comment further detract from any sense of natural speech.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The handling of technical terminology is very poor. Key technical terms such as 'fenêtre de contexte' (context window) and 'ancrage' (grounding) are left untranslated in French, which is a major error. While 'pré-entraînement' and 'aprendizaje por transferencia' are translated correctly, the inconsistent and incorrect translation of 'fine-tuning' ('afinación' vs. 'tuning') and the untranslated French terms demonstrate a significant lack of precision.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text's intent, which is to clearly explain complex AI concepts in a conversational podcast format, is largely lost due to the numerous translation errors. The conversational tone is constantly interrupted by untranslated text and grammatical mistakes. The inclusion of an irrelevant English comment completely distorts the original purpose of conveying information from Luc to Camille.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Information completeness is extremely poor. A significant portion of Luc's dialogue explaining 'pré-entraînement' is either missing or incorrectly rendered as just 'pré-entraînement'. Crucially, an entire paragraph of Luc's explanation about transfer learning and how AI becomes an expert is replaced by an English descriptive comment, completely omitting the original content. The failure to translate 'fenêtre de contexte' and 'ancrage' also means the information conveyed by these terms is not fully or correctly presented to the Spanish reader.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation exhibits significant quality issues across all evaluation criteria. The most critical problems include the failure to translate key French technical terms, the inexplicable insertion of an English descriptive comment in place of original dialogue, and numerous grammatical and lexical errors. These issues severely hinder readability, fluency, and information completeness, making the translated text largely unreadable and failing to convey the original meaning and intent. Extensive revision is required to make this translation acceptable."
