The vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary, and there are no awkward grammatical constructions or unnatural expressions. The dialogue maintains its podcast-like, conversational tone consistently throughout, contributing significantly to its overall fluency.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as 'pre-entrenamiento' (pré-entraînement), 'ajuste fino' (affinage / fine-tuning), 'aprendizaje por transferencia' (apprentissage par transfert), 'ventana de contexto' (fenêtre de contexte), and 'aprendizaje en contexto' (apprentissage en contexte) are accurately and consistently translated or adapted. The term 'grounding' is maintained as it was provided in English in the original, and 'Memoria' for the AI feature is well-handled. The choices reflect standard terminology in the field of AI in Spanish.",
