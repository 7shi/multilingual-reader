  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The 'translation' is severely fragmented, with numerous sections left untranslated, replaced by internal notes, justifications, or English phrases. This makes the text utterly unreadable and incomprehensible as a continuous conversation. Even in the scattered translated segments, there are grammatical issues that further hinder understanding.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The presence of untranslated segments, analytical comments, and grammatical errors (e.g., 'el palabras', 'un consultante', 'varias años', 'Las nuevas conocimientos') makes the text entirely unnatural and non-fluent. The conversational flow, essential for a podcast transcript, is completely broken.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While some technical terms like 'pre-entrenamiento', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', and 'aprendizaje en contexto' are correctly identified and translated, their appropriate handling and explanation within a coherent text are completely lacking. Key explanations are often replaced by internal comments or left untranslated, preventing the reader from grasping the concepts as intended by the original.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text is a conversational podcast explaining AI concepts. The 'translation' fails entirely to convey this intent or adapt to the context. The dynamic and explanatory tone is lost due to the extreme fragmentation, and the inclusion of non-translated elements and internal commentary means the text cannot function as a podcast transcript for a Spanish-speaking audience.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This is the most critically affected criterion. A vast majority of the original content is missing, untranslated, or replaced by non-translational material like evaluation notes and English phrases. The entire conversation is incomplete, making it impossible to understand the information being conveyed.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "This submission is not a functional translation. It is an incomplete and fragmented document that intersperses translated phrases with untranslated source text, internal translation notes, and English commentary. It fails to convey the original conversation's meaning, flow, or intent and is incomprehensible as a Spanish text. It appears to be an intermediate working document rather than a final translated output."
