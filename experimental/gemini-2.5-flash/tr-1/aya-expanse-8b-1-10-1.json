    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally understandable, but some phrases are overly literal or a bit clunky for a native Spanish speaker. For instance, 'para darle educación general' is less natural than 'para que adquiera una cultura general'. The unrequested addition of lengthy sentences in Camille's dialogue significantly disrupts the flow and makes the conversation less natural and harder to follow as a direct translation of the original podcast format.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several instances of non-idiomatic expressions and awkward phrasing that affect its naturalness. Examples include 'esto es hecho posible' instead of 'esto es posible gracias a', 'que tenga conocimiento de las mismas informaciones' which should typically be 'que conozca la misma información', and the repetitive use of 'ella olvida todo'. The choice of 'solicitud' for 'prompt' is also less natural than simply using 'prompt' or 'instrucción' in a tech context. These issues, along with the added sentences, prevent the text from flowing smoothly.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are translated correctly and consistently, such as 'preentrenamiento' (pré-entraînement), 'ajuste fino' (affinage), 'aprendizaje por transferencia' (apprentissage par transfert), 'ventana de contexto' (fenêtre de contexte), 'aprendizaje en contexto' (apprentissage en contexte), and 'anclaje' (ancrage). The inclusion of the English equivalent 'fine-tuning' is helpful. However, the consistent translation of 'prompt' as 'solicitud' feels less precise and natural in the AI context, where 'prompt' or 'instrucción' are more common. The slight redundancy in 'ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)' is minor.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally maintains the conversational and informative tone appropriate for a podcast. The use of analogies is well-preserved. However, the most significant issue lies in the unrequested addition of two substantial explanatory sentences in Camille's dialogue. This alters the original conversational rhythm and the explicit intent of the source text, where Camille's lines were concise and prompted further explanation from Luc. This change fundamentally misunderstands the context and purpose of the original dialogue.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "While the translation largely covers the information from the original text, it significantly *adds* information not present in the source. Specifically, two of Camille's responses ('Así que, en lugar de volver a entrenar a la IA...' and 'De acuerdo. Entiendo perfectamente lo que estás diciendo...') are heavily expanded with content that did not exist in the French original. This addition of content, though seemingly explanatory, goes against the principle of maintaining the original information's scope and conciseness, leading to an inaccurate representation of the source.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully conveys the core technical concepts of the original podcast and largely maintains a conversational tone. Technical terminology is handled well for the most part, with appropriate Spanish equivalents. However, the translation suffers from significant issues in fluency and fidelity, primarily due to overly literal phrasing and, more critically, the unrequested addition of lengthy explanatory sentences in Camille's dialogue. These additions disrupt the original context, flow, and information completeness, making the translated conversation less natural and less faithful to the source text. Improvements in idiomatic expression and adherence to the original content's scope would greatly enhance the translation quality."
