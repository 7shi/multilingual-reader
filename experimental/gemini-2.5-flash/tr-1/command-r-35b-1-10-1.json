  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text's readability is severely impacted by the inclusion of two large blocks of untranslated English text within the Spanish translation. For a Spanish-speaking audience, these sections are completely incomprehensible and disrupt the flow entirely. Additionally, there's an inconsistent use of formal and informal address ('Imaginad' vs. 'puedes', 'abre') which makes the text jarring and less natural to follow. A grammatical error like 'Las conocimientos' also detracts from clarity, and the misphrasing of 'C'est-à-dire ?' as '¿Me refiero a...?' causes confusion.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The direct insertion of untranslated English text in critical explanatory sections makes the translation entirely un-fluent in those parts. This is a fundamental error. Furthermore, the inconsistent address to the audience (shifting between formal 'ustedes' and informal 'tú' forms) creates an unnatural and awkward listening/reading experience for native Spanish speakers. Minor grammatical slips and slightly less idiomatic phrasing ('trampa' for 'antisèche' instead of 'chuleta') also contribute to a lack of naturalness.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Many technical terms like 'pre-entrenamiento', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'anclaje', and 'aprendizaje en contexto' are correctly and appropriately translated. However, the term 'fine-tuning' is translated as 'la especialización' or 'el afinado', which, while conveying a sense of specialization, is less precise and less standard in the AI/ML field than 'ajuste fino' or 'refinamiento'. This slight deviation impacts the overall technical accuracy, though the inclusion of the English term in parentheses sometimes clarifies the intent.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "While the conversational tone and dialogue structure of a podcast are generally preserved, the intent and purpose of explaining complex AI concepts are severely undermined by the untranslated English content. These sections would be confusing and alienating to a Spanish-speaking audience, breaking the educational context. The initial adaptation of 'boîtes noires' to 'algo misterioso' was good, but this positive point is overshadowed by the critical errors in other sections that prevent effective communication of the source's intent.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the substantive information from the original French text is present in the Spanish translation. No key concepts, explanations, or dialogue points were omitted. The primary issue is the inclusion of extraneous, untranslated English content rather than a lack of original information, which means the content is not entirely concise and clear in places where the English appears.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation demonstrates a basic understanding of the source text and correctly translates many individual phrases and technical terms. However, it suffers from critical and severe flaws that significantly impact its quality. The most egregious errors are the direct inclusion of large, untranslated English paragraphs, which render those sections unusable for a Spanish-speaking audience. Additionally, the inconsistent use of formal and informal address throughout the podcast dialogue creates an unnatural and awkward experience. While information is complete, and some parts are well-translated, these fundamental issues make the translation largely unacceptable for professional use. The choice of 'afinamiento' or 'ajuste fino' for 'fine-tuning' would also improve terminological precision."
