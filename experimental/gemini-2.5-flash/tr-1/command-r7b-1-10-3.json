    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains significant issues that severely hinder readability. Several lines from the original French text are untranslated or replaced with evaluation comments, creating confusing gaps. Key grammatical errors, such as 'Por qué' instead of 'Porque' and 'conoscencias' instead of 'conocimientos,' directly impact comprehension. The excessive and often misplaced exclamation marks also make the text visually jarring and difficult to follow as a natural dialogue.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text lacks naturalness and fluency in Spanish. Many phrases are literal translations that sound awkward ('¡Y soy Luc.', '¿Qué es decir?', 'tengo necesidad de'). The presence of original French sentences, repeated Spanish lines, and inserted comments completely breaks the conversational flow. The incorrect use of exclamation marks and grammatical mistakes further contribute to an unnatural and choppy reading experience.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While some terms like 'preentrenamiento' are correctly translated, there are significant inconsistencies and inaccuracies. The term 'affinage' (fine-tuning) is translated variously as 'afinación,' 'afinamiento,' and 'refinando,' none of which are the most standard 'ajuste fino' in AI contexts. 'Ancrage' (grounding) is translated as 'enracinamiento' instead of the more appropriate 'anclaje' or 'fundamentación.' Crucially, a key explanation of 'l'apprentissage par transfert' is left in French, and Camille's question about it is replaced by evaluation comments, indicating a failure to handle core terminology.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text's intent as an informative yet conversational podcast is largely lost. The numerous translation errors, structural problems (untranslated parts, repetitions, inserted comments), and unnatural phrasing prevent the Spanish text from conveying the original's engaging tone. The overuse of exclamation marks also creates a tone that is more excitable than professionally informative, failing to adapt to the podcast context.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This is the most problematic area. Several significant parts of the original text are either entirely omitted (e.g., Luc's explanation of transfer learning, parts of his context explanation, 'en coulisses'), or directly replaced by extraneous evaluation comments (e.g., Camille's question about transfer learning). Furthermore, a sentence is repeated multiple times verbatim. This results in a severely incomplete and fragmented transfer of information, making it impossible to fully understand the original content.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation is of very low quality and cannot be used as presented. It contains critical errors including untranslated segments, repeated text, and extraneous evaluation comments inserted directly into the translation, which fundamentally breaks the text. Beyond these structural issues, there are numerous grammatical mistakes, unnatural phrasings, and inconsistent or incorrect technical terminology. The overall result is a confusing, incomplete, and poorly-rendered version of the original French podcast script."
