    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is generally easy to read and follow. Sentence structures are clear, and the overall flow, despite some added phrases, maintains comprehensibility. Complex concepts are explained in a way that is accessible, mirroring the original's pedagogical approach.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While largely understandable, the translation exhibits several instances of phrasing that sound less natural to a native Spanish speaker. Examples include 'exactos documentos informativos' (should be 'documentos informativos exactos'), 'una artimaña' for 'une astuce' (too strong a word choice), 'una guía' for 'une antisèche' (misses the nuance of 'cheat sheet'), and 'instrumentos' for 'outils' (less common than 'herramientas' in this context). The added dialogue also disrupts the natural back-and-forth of the original podcast script.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The translation handles technical terms very well. Key terms like 'pré-entraînement' (preentrenamiento), 'affinage' (ajuste fino), 'apprentissage par transfert' (aprendizaje por transferencia), 'fenêtre de contexte' (ventana de contexto), 'apprentissage en contexte' (aprendizaje en contexto), and 'ancrage' (anclaje) are accurately and consistently translated. The English acronym ICL is also retained with its Spanish equivalent. There's a minor inconsistency between 'preentrenamiento' and 'pre-entrenamiento', but it doesn't hinder understanding.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "This criterion is significantly impacted by the translator's decision to add substantial dialogue for the character Camille that was not present in the original French transcript. For example, a simple 'D'accord' is expanded into a full paragraph. This fundamentally alters the conversational dynamic and the intent of the original script, where Camille's role was often to prompt Luc or acknowledge his points concisely. The inconsistency in the podcast name at the very end ('Tech Destello' instead of 'Tech Éclair') also shows a lack of attention to maintaining brand consistency.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "While all original information is conveyed, the translation includes significant additions not present in the source text. These additions, while related to the topic, are extra content inserted into the dialogue, particularly for Camille's lines. Information completeness typically refers to ensuring no original information is omitted and that appropriate supplements (like explanations) are provided *if needed* to aid understanding, not adding new information to the text itself. The inclusion of new sentences and even a full paragraph not in the original detracts from faithfulness to the source text's completeness.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation effectively conveys the core technical information and concepts, showcasing strong handling of specialized terminology. However, its overall quality is diminished by a lack of fluency in several areas, with awkward phrasing and less natural word choices for a native Spanish speaker. Crucially, the translator significantly deviated from the original dialogue structure by adding extensive lines for the character Camille, which alters the conversational flow and intent. This approach negatively impacts contextual adaptation and information completeness, making the output less a direct translation and more an adaptation of the original script. Consistency in branding (podcast title) is also an issue."
