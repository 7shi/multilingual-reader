    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled with great precision and consistency. Terms like 'pre-entrenamiento', 'afinamiento' (fine-tuning), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto' (ICL), and 'anclaje' (grounding) are correctly translated and commonly understood in the Spanish tech context. The inclusion of the English terms in parentheses for 'fine-tuning' and 'grounding' is a thoughtful addition that enhances clarity for readers familiar with the English terminology.",
