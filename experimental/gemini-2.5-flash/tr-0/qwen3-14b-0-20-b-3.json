    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally understandable, and the core concepts are conveyed clearly. However, grammatical inconsistencies, particularly the switch between formal 'ustedes' and informal 'tú' forms when addressing the listener, and some awkward phrasing stemming from overly literal translations, can disrupt the reading flow and require the audience to pause or re-read.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation lacks naturalness in several places. The inconsistent use of 'tú' and 'ustedes' forms throughout the podcast script is a significant detractor from fluency, as it creates a jarring experience for a native speaker. Additionally, there are instances of literal translation (e.g., 'Eso es exactamente eso' for 'C'est tout à fait ça', 'Es toda la potencia de este enfoque' for 'C'est toute la puissance de cette approche') and repetitive phrasing ('Por lo tanto') that make the text sound less idiomatic and smooth. Grammatical errors like 'Él trasfiere' (should be 'transfiere'), 'Las nuevas conocimientos' (should be 'Los nuevos conocimientos'), and 'haber nos escuchado' (should be 'habernos escuchado') also negatively impact the overall fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The technical terminology is handled very well. Terms like 'preentrenamiento,' 'afinamiento,' 'aprendizaje por transferencia,' 'ventana de contexto,' 'aprendizaje en contexto,' and 'anclaje' are accurate and appropriate for a technology podcast. The translator also correctly retained the English equivalents in parentheses for clarity (e.g., 'fine-tuning,' 'grounding'), which is excellent practice for the target audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The core intent of the original text—explaining AI learning in a podcast format—is effectively conveyed. The tone is mostly conversational, suitable for a podcast. The adaptation of 'bachoter' to 'estudiar de última hora' is particularly good. However, the inconsistent address forms ('tú' vs. 'ustedes') represent a significant oversight in contextual adaptation, as a podcast typically maintains a consistent way of addressing its audience. The translation of 'antisèche' as 'un resumen' is understandable but loses some of the vividness of the original 'cheat sheet' analogy.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original French text has been accurately translated and is present in the Spanish version. There are no notable omissions or additions that alter the meaning. The content remains concise and clear in its delivery of information.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation is largely accurate in its technical content and fully conveys the information from the source. However, its overall quality is diminished by significant issues in fluency and readability. The inconsistent use of formal ('ustedes') and informal ('tú') address forms is the most prominent flaw, creating a disjointed listening experience for a Spanish-speaking audience in a podcast context. Additionally, several instances of overly literal translation and some grammatical errors prevent the text from sounding completely natural and polished. While the terminology is excellent, a review focused on natural phrasing, grammatical consistency, and idiomatic expression would significantly improve the translation quality."
