    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally easy to follow and the sentence structures are logical. However, a significant mistranslation of 'bachoter' as 'hacer trampa para un examen' (cheating for an exam) instead of 'cramming for an exam' makes a core analogy confusing and misleading. This directly impacts the clarity of the explanation regarding in-context learning and temporary memory. Additionally, the inconsistent handling of 'prompt' and the direct retention of the French term 'ancrage' detract slightly from the overall ease of understanding for a Spanish-speaking audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly flows naturally and uses appropriate Spanish grammar and syntax. Most vocabulary choices are suitable for the context. However, some phrases feel a bit too literal (e.g., 'Todo el poder de este enfoque' could be 'Ahí radica todo el poder de este enfoque') and the fundamental error in translating 'bachoter' creates an awkward and incorrect analogy, which breaks the naturalness of the explanation at a critical point.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Several technical terms like 'pre-entrenamiento', 'afinamiento' (with English parenthetical), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', and 'ventana de contexto' are translated correctly and consistently. However, there are notable issues. 'ICL (In-Context Learning)' is translated as 'AIC', which is not the standard abbreviation in Spanish tech contexts (ICL is commonly used). 'Ancrage' is kept in French, with 'grounding' in parentheses, instead of being translated to 'anclaje', which is the correct term. 'Prompt' is inconsistently handled, sometimes translated as 'solicitud' (request), which is too general for the specific AI context, and sometimes kept as 'prompt'. This inconsistency and lack of precise terminology reduces the score.",

    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation successfully maintains the conversational and explanatory tone suitable for a podcast. The dialogue structure between Camille and Luc is well-preserved. However, the critical mistranslation of 'bachoter' (cramming) as 'hacer trampa' (cheating) fundamentally distorts a key analogy used to explain the difference between temporary and permanent AI knowledge. This error significantly alters the original intent and purpose of that specific section, failing to adapt the context correctly for the intended explanation.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All explicit information and concepts from the original text are present in the translation, with no significant omissions. However, the *meaning* and *clarity* of certain crucial pieces of information are distorted due to the terminology and analogy errors, particularly regarding 'in-context learning' and the nature of AI's temporary memory. While the words are there, their intended explanatory power is diminished.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation provides a generally fluent rendition of the podcast transcript. Many technical terms are handled correctly, and the conversational tone is maintained. However, the translation suffers from critical flaws in specific terminology and analogy explanations. The mistranslation of 'bachoter' as 'hacer trampa' fundamentally misrepresents a core concept, and the inconsistent or incorrect handling of terms like 'prompt', 'ancrage', and the ICL abbreviation 'AIC' detract from the accuracy and clarity, especially for a text explaining complex AI concepts. Improvements in precise terminology and careful consideration of analogies are necessary for better quality."
