    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely comprehensible, explaining complex AI concepts clearly through analogies. However, there are a couple of grammatical errors that slightly hinder readability, such as the incorrect use of «se recuerda de» instead of «recuerda» or «se acuerda de», and a missing opening question mark in «¿Por qué ya comprende...?». The inconsistent use of «afinamiento» and «ajuste fino» for the same technical concept also creates minor friction.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally flows well and maintains a conversational tone appropriate for a podcast. Vocabulary choices like «chuleta» for «antisèche» are excellent and natural. However, the phrase «se recuerda de» is grammatically incorrect and sounds very unnatural to a native speaker. The use of «Más bien» for «Voyez plutôt» feels a bit stiff, and the repetition of «Ella olvida todo. Ella lo olvida todo.» could be more concise. These issues detract from the overall naturalness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are translated accurately and appropriately, such as «preentrenamiento», «aprendizaje por transferencia», «ventana de contexto», «aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)», and «anclaje (grounding)». The initial translation of «fine-tuning» as «el ajuste fino» with a parenthetical explanation is excellent. However, the subsequent, inconsistent use of «el afinamiento» for the same term is a notable lapse in terminological consistency. While «afinamiento» is understandable, «ajuste fino» is the more standard and consistent term in the machine learning context.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation successfully captures the informal yet informative tone of the original podcast. The conversational style between Camille and Luc is well-maintained, and the analogies used to explain complex concepts are effectively carried over and remain culturally relevant. The use of «usted» for addressing the general audience (e.g., «sus datos», «sus conversaciones») is appropriate for the context, reflecting a formal yet accessible interaction.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information and concepts from the original French text, including the distinctions between pre-training, fine-tuning, in-context learning, and how AI 'memory' functions, are fully and accurately conveyed in the Spanish translation. No critical details are omitted, and no extraneous information is added. The dialogue structure and the progression of ideas are completely preserved.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is generally strong, particularly in its ability to convey complex technical information in an accessible and engaging podcast format. It largely preserves the original's tone and intent, and most technical terms are handled well. However, its overall quality is slightly undermined by a few significant grammatical errors and inconsistencies in terminology, especially the phrase «se recuerda de» and the fluctuating use of «afinamiento» versus «ajuste fino» for 'fine-tuning'. Addressing these specific points would greatly enhance the fluency and polish of the translation."
