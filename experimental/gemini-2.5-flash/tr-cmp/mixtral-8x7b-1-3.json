    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The readability is hindered by several grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent use of formal and informal address ('tú' vs 'usted'), which makes the text less smooth and harder to follow for a native speaker. Punctuation errors also detract from the flow.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation frequently sounds unnatural. Examples include redundant subject pronouns ('Ella lee'), incorrect or awkward phrasing ('Está completamente de acuerdo' for 'C'est tout à fait ça', 'Mire' for 'Voyez plutôt', 'integralidad' for 'intégralité', 'y pronto para el siguiente episodio'). The inconsistency in formality further disrupts the natural conversational flow expected in a podcast.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While some technical terms like 'pre-entrenamiento', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto', and 'anclaje' are translated correctly, there are significant issues. 'Especialización' for 'affinage' is less precise than 'afinamiento' or 'ajuste fino'. Crucially, 'inefficace' is mistranslated as 'inexplicable' instead of 'ineficaz' or 'ineficiente', and 'astuce' (trick/tip) is translated as 'característica' (feature), fundamentally altering the meaning of those sentences.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation struggles with contextual adaptation, primarily due to the inconsistent formality (mixing 'tú' and 'usted' within the same conversation), which is inappropriate for a podcast setting that should maintain a consistent, usually informal, tone. The mistranslation of 'astuce' as 'característica' also changes the intended meaning and nuance of the speaker's question.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Two full lines of dialogue from the original French transcript were completely omitted from the Spanish translation. Specifically, Luc's introduction of 'pré-entraînement' and Camille's subsequent echo of the term are missing. This is a major omission that significantly impacts the completeness of the information conveyed.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation exhibits significant weaknesses across multiple criteria. The most critical issues are the omission of two full lines of dialogue, which severely impacts information completeness, and the critical mistranslations of key terms like 'inefficace' and 'astuce', which undermine the accuracy of the technical content. Furthermore, the translation suffers from frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent formality, making it sound unnatural and less readable for a native Spanish speaker. While some individual terms are well-translated, the overall quality is significantly compromised by these deficiencies."
