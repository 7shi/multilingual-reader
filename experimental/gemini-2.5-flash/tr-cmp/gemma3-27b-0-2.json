    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is very easy to read and understand. The sentence structures are logical and flow well, mirroring the conversational style of the original podcast. Complex concepts are clearly explained through effective analogies, ensuring high comprehensibility for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text generally sounds natural and smooth in Spanish. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary. However, there is an inconsistency in the use of the second-person pronoun when addressing the audience. The original French consistently uses the formal plural 'vous', but the Spanish translation frequently shifts between formal plural ('Imaginen', 'les enseñarían') and informal singular ('Puedes', 'tus datos', 'Lo has entendido', 'proporcionas', 'necesitas', 'tus conversaciones', 'abres', 'partes', 'contigo'). This inconsistency, while not hindering comprehension, slightly detracts from the overall naturalness and creates an uneven tone.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "All technical terms are translated accurately and appropriately for the context, showing a strong understanding of AI-related vocabulary. Terms like 'pre-entrenamiento', 'ajuste fino', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto', and 'anclaje' are correctly used. The retention of English terms in parentheses (e.g., 'fine-tuning', 'grounding', 'In-Context Learning') is also helpful for clarity in a technical discussion.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation effectively conveys the original text's intent and purpose, maintaining the informative and conversational tone suitable for a tech podcast. The analogies used in the French are well-preserved and resonate culturally in Spanish. The adaptation of 'une antisèche' to 'una guía rápida' is a good example of optimizing an expression for a slightly more professional tone without losing the original meaning. The only minor point, as mentioned in fluency, is the inconsistent direct address, which slightly impacts the intended audience interaction.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original French text is conveyed without any omissions. The explanations, examples, and the core distinction between different AI learning methods are fully present in the Spanish translation. There is no redundancy, and the content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "This is a high-quality translation that effectively converts a complex technical discussion into accessible Spanish. The use of technical terminology is excellent, and the translation maintains the informative and conversational tone of the original podcast. The only significant area for improvement is the inconsistent use of second-person pronouns when addressing the audience, which oscillates between formal plural and informal singular. Addressing this consistency would elevate the translation to near-perfect status."
