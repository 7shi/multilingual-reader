    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The readability is severely impacted by several issues. Key dialogue lines from the original French text are left untranslated ('Le pré-entraînement.', 'L'affinage...', 'D'accord.'), forcing the Spanish reader to switch languages or guess. Additionally, the translation includes extensive meta-commentary, translator's notes, and multiple parenthetical options for single phrases (e.g., '¿no es así? (o ¿verdad?)... ¿O me equivoco? (dependiendo del tono de Camille)'), which are not part of a coherent translated output and make the text cluttered and difficult to follow. The formatting with excessive bolding and italics also contributes to a visually noisy and less readable experience.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation suffers significantly from a lack of fluency and naturalness. The direct inclusion of untranslated French phrases directly breaks the flow for a Spanish speaker. The self-correction and multiple options within the dialogue (e.g., for Camille's lines) make the conversation sound choppy and unnatural, more like a working draft than a final podcast transcript. There are also minor grammatical errors like 'Las conocimientos' which should be 'Los conocimientos'. The choice of 'chivato' for 'antisèche' is too informal and potentially misleading for a technical podcast context.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "This is the strongest aspect of the translation. The translator demonstrates a good understanding of technical terms in AI. Terms like 'pretraining' (preentrenamiento), 'fine-tuning' (afinamiento), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)', and 'anclaje (grounding)' are correctly identified and translated or appropriately retained with clarification. The accompanying meta-commentary (though misplaced in the output) shows a clear rationale for the chosen terms, indicating strong technical knowledge.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text is a conversational podcast. The translation fails to adapt to this context primarily due to the repeated non-translation of dialogue segments, which completely breaks the conversational flow. The inclusion of lengthy translator's notes within the body of Luc's speech is entirely inappropriate for a podcast transcript and destroys the intended context. The inconsistency in translating the podcast title ('Tech Éclair' retained, then options like 'Tecno Relámpago' at the end) also detracts from contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Information completeness is severely compromised. Crucial dialogue lines from the original text are completely omitted from translation and left in French, meaning the Spanish version does not convey all the original information. Conversely, a large block of translator's notes and meta-commentary, which is not part of the original content, is added into the translated text, introducing irrelevant information.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation has significant flaws across multiple criteria. While the translator demonstrates a solid understanding of the technical terminology, the execution is hampered by numerous untranslated segments, the inappropriate inclusion of extensive translator's notes within the output, and stylistic choices that negatively impact readability and fluency. The overall result is not a cohesive or professional translation of a podcast transcript. It appears more like a working draft with internal commentary rather than a final, polished product."
