    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation flows very naturally in Spanish. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary, and there are no awkward grammatical constructions. Idiomatic expressions like \"bachoter pour un examen\" being translated to \"estudiar a última hora para un examen\" significantly enhance the naturalness and feel of the dialogue.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms related to AI and machine learning are handled accurately and consistently. Terms like \"preentrenamiento,\" \"aprendizaje por transferencia,\" \"ventana de contexto,\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are standard in Spanish technical contexts. \"Afinamiento\" for \"fine-tuning\" is a suitable choice, aligning with the general meaning of refinement.",

    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation effectively conveys the original text's intent and purpose, which is to explain AI learning concepts in a conversational podcast format. The analogies are well-preserved, and the use of \"chuleta\" for \"antisèche\" is an excellent idiomatic and cultural adaptation that resonates well with Spanish speakers, making the explanation more relatable.",
