    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally easy to understand, with clear sentence structures and logical flow. Complex concepts are explained using similar analogies as in the original, aiding comprehension. However, the inconsistent use of formal/informal and singular/plural pronouns when addressing the listener (switching between 'tú', 'usted', and 'ustedes') can be a minor distraction and cause momentary confusion, slightly impacting overall readability, though not to the extent of impeding understanding of the core content.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The most significant issue affecting fluency is the inconsistent use of second-person pronouns. The translation frequently switches between 'tú' (informal singular), 'usted' (formal singular), 'ustedes' (formal plural), and sometimes even 'nosotros' (we) when referring to the implied listener(s) of the podcast. This lack of consistency is unnatural for a Spanish-speaking audience and disrupts the flow of the conversation. For a podcast, a consistent 'ustedes' (or 'vosotros' in Spain) or an impersonal 'se' would be more appropriate and natural. Additionally, a minor grammatical error, 'Por qué ya comprende' which should be 'Porque ya comprende' (a causal conjunction instead of an interrogative pronoun), slightly detracts from the naturalness.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "All technical terms are translated accurately and consistently. 'Pré-entraînement' is correctly translated as 'pre-entrenamiento', 'affinage' as 'ajuste fino', 'apprentissage par transfert' as 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'fenêtre de contexte' as 'ventana de contexto', 'apprentissage en contexte' as 'aprendizaje en contexto', and 'ancrage' as 'anclaje'. The term 'prompt' is retained, which is standard, and 'antisèche' is well-adapted to 'chuleta'. The explanations of these terms are also precise and correct.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation successfully conveys the intent and purpose of the original podcast, explaining technical concepts in an accessible, conversational manner. The analogies used in the French text are effectively translated and maintain their explanatory power. However, the inconsistent addressing of the audience (as noted in fluency) undermines the desired conversational rapport and a consistent tone that is crucial for a podcast, thus slightly affecting how well the text adapts to its intended context.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French text has been accurately conveyed without any omissions or significant additions. Every concept, explanation, and example is present in the Spanish translation, ensuring that the reader receives the full message intended by the original authors. The logical progression of ideas is also fully preserved.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is strong in its accurate rendering of technical terminology and its complete transfer of information. However, its quality is significantly diminished by a pervasive inconsistency in addressing the listener, switching confusingly between informal/formal and singular/plural pronouns (tú, usted, ustedes). This issue severely impacts the naturalness and fluency expected in a podcast, detracting from the overall conversational tone and rapport. A minor grammatical error also occurs. While the core message is understandable, the stylistic and grammatical inconsistencies make the text less professional and natural for a Spanish-speaking audience."
