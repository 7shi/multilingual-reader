    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The readability is severely compromised by two instances of untranslated original text (`#black boxes` and `pre-entrenamiento`) and a critical information omission where Camille's lines should have been. Additionally, there are frequent punctuation errors (e.g., `¡Exactamente.`) which break the flow, and some sentence structures are clunky or overly literal, making them less natural to read for a Spanish speaker. The inconsistent use of 'tú' and 'usted' forms further adds to the cognitive load.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation often sounds unnatural due to overly literal renditions from French and poor grammatical choices. Examples include 'Eso es por lo que' instead of 'Es por eso que', 'sorprendentemente baja' instead of 'sorprendentemente poca', and 'documentos precisos de información' instead of more natural alternatives. The colloquialisms 'cramar' for 'bachoter' and 'chuleta' for 'antisèche' feel out of place for a technical podcast, and the repetition of 'Ella olvida todo' is redundant and unnatural. The inconsistent use of formal ('usted') and informal ('tú') address further hinders naturalness.",

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While some key terms like 'pre-entrenamiento', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', and 'anclaje' are adequately translated, there are significant issues. 'Affinage' is initially left in French, then translated inconsistently as 'afinamiento' and later 'ajuste fino'. The acronym 'ICL' is correctly introduced but later incorrectly referred to as 'AIC'. The untranslated `#black boxes` is a major terminology failure. The use of 'cramar' and 'chuleta' for technical concepts is inappropriately colloquial, potentially confusing the audience.",

    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely fails to adapt to the context of an informative technical podcast. The untranslated segments completely break the conversational flow, and the grammatical and punctuation errors detract from the professionalism. The inconsistent formality (tú/usted) creates confusion for the listener's perspective. While the overall structure of a dialogue is maintained, the execution flaws prevent it from effectively conveying the original intent and tone.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This is the weakest point. Two crucial segments of Camille's dialogue are entirely omitted and replaced with raw, untranslated text (`#black boxes` and `pre-entrenamiento`), making parts of the conversation unintelligible and significantly incomplete. Furthermore, the acronym 'ICL' is mistakenly rendered as 'AIC' at one point, which is an error in information. While most other sentences are translated, the complete omission of critical lines is a severe flaw.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation suffers from major issues that severely impact its quality. The most critical problem is the direct omission of original text in two of Camille's lines, which appear as untranslated placeholders. This fundamentally undermines information completeness and readability. Beyond that, the translation is plagued by frequent grammatical and punctuation errors, inconsistent use of formal and informal address, and overly literal or colloquial phrasing that makes the text sound unnatural and detracts from the intended tone of a technical podcast. While some technical terms are translated correctly, others are handled inconsistently or with inappropriate casualness. A comprehensive review and revision are necessary to address these shortcomings."
