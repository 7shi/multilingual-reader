    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally comprehensible, and the sentence structures are mostly clear. However, the inconsistent use of formal ('usted') and informal ('tú') address within the dialogue can be jarring and slightly impact the flow and ease of reading for a native Spanish speaker. The expansion of a rhetorical question at one point also breaks the original conversational rhythm.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The most significant issue affecting fluency is the inconsistent use of 'tú' and 'usted' forms when addressing the listener/interlocutor (e.g., 'imaginen' vs. 'puedes', 'Ha comprendido' vs. 'necesitas', 'abres' vs. 'su espacio'). This constant switching is highly unnatural in Spanish. Additionally, the varied terminology for 'fine-tuning' ('ajuste fino', 'afinamiento', 'afilado') and 'ICL' ('Aprendizaje en Contexto', 'Aprendizaje en Contexto Limitado') reduces the smoothness and naturalness of the technical discussion.",

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms like 'pre-entrenamiento', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', and 'anclaje' are correctly translated. However, there is a lack of consistency in the translation of 'fine-tuning' (using 'ajuste fino', 'afinamiento', and 'afilado' interchangeably). Similarly, 'ICL' is first defined as 'Aprendizaje en Contexto' and later re-explained as 'Aprendizaje en Contexto Limitado', creating confusion. The translation of 'prompt' also varies ('solicitud', 'petición'). 'Antisèche' as 'esquema' is also a weaker translation, missing the 'cheat sheet' connotation.",

    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely conveys the intent and purpose of the original text. However, the inconsistent formal/informal address detracts from a natural adaptation for a Spanish-speaking audience in a podcast setting. Furthermore, expanding Camille's rhetorical question, 'La différence entre bachoter pour un examen et maîtriser réellement un sujet ?', into an explanatory statement rather than a direct question, alters the conversational dynamic and the original's concise rhetorical style.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "One sentence, 'Les langues en sont un excellent exemple' (Languages are an excellent example), is omitted from Luc's speech regarding transfer learning. While most other information is present, the aforementioned expansion of Camille's question adds information not strictly present in the original's concise query. The translation of 'on lui a juste fourni une antisèche' to 'solo le proporcionaron un esquema' also slightly shifts the nuance and agency from the original's impersonal 'on'.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation effectively conveys the core technical concepts of AI learning. However, its quality is significantly hampered by glaring inconsistencies in the use of formal ('usted') and informal ('tú') address throughout the dialogue, which makes the text unnatural and difficult to follow for a native Spanish speaker. Furthermore, the inconsistent terminology for key concepts like 'fine-tuning' and 'ICL', along with a minor omission and some unnecessary expansions, detract from the overall fluency and precision. While the content is generally understandable, these issues prevent it from being a polished and natural-sounding translation."
