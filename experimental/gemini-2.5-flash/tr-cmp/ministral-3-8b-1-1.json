    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The readability is extremely low due to several segments containing internal meta-commentary or being completely untranslated, making large portions of the text incomprehensible. Even in the translated segments, grammatical errors (gender agreement, verb tense, awkward phrasing) and typos hinder smooth reading and understanding.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The fluency is very poor. The presence of untranslated segments completely disrupts any natural flow. The inconsistent use of 'tú' and 'usted' forms throughout the dialogue is jarring and unnatural for a single conversational piece. Grammatical errors, typos, and awkward phrasing ('La IA no es un olvido') also contribute to a highly unnatural-sounding text.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "When technical terms are actually translated (e.g., 'preentrenamiento', 'ajuste fino', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'grounding'), they are generally appropriate and consistent with common Spanish AI terminology. However, the score is severely affected by the numerous instances where technical discussions are replaced by meta-text or are simply missing, leading to a critical lack of information about terminology in key parts of the discussion.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely fails to maintain the original text's intent and purpose due to the extensive missing content. While some analogies are preserved where text is present, the highly inconsistent use of formal ('usted') and informal ('tú') address for the audience and speakers creates a fragmented and unprofessional tone, failing to adapt cohesively to a Spanish-speaking podcast context. The overall narrative and conversational flow are severely broken.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This criterion is critically low. Several large segments of the original French text are either replaced by internal evaluation comments, left completely untranslated (copied French text), or are drastically truncated. This results in a massive loss of information, making the 'translation' largely incomplete and unusable for understanding the original content.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation is fundamentally flawed due to the pervasive issue of large portions of the text being replaced by internal meta-commentary or left untranslated. This directly leads to a near-total loss of information completeness, readability, and fluency. Beyond these critical structural problems, the translated segments also suffer from recurring grammatical errors (e.g., gender agreement, verb conjugation), typos, and an inconsistent application of formal ('usted') and informal ('tú') address, which further detracts from its quality and naturalness. While some individual technical terms are handled correctly where present, the overwhelming number of severe errors makes this translation unusable."
