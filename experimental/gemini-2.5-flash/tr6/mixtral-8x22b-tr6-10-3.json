    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally understandable, but several formatting and grammatical errors, along with the inconsistent use of 'you' (singular/plural, formal/informal), detract from its natural flow and make some parts slightly less smooth to read. The 'Final Translation' artifact for one of Camille's lines is a significant readability blocker. The omission of text also affects the full understanding of certain concepts.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation often flows well, but numerous small errors and awkward phrasing prevent it from sounding entirely natural to a native speaker. The inconsistent use of formal/informal 'you' between speakers and within the text is a significant detractor from naturalness in a podcast dialogue. Grammatical slips (e.g., missing question marks, 'Por qué' instead of '¿Por qué?') and suboptimal word choices (e.g., 'Ella lee' for 'elle lit', 'registra' for 'se souvient', 'poco nuevo conocimiento' for 'peu d'informations nouvelles') also reduce fluency.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are translated accurately and consistently using standard Spanish equivalents in the AI/ML field (e.g., 'preentrenamiento', 'ajuste fino', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto', 'anclaje'). However, the translation of 'prompt' as 'invitación' is a notable error, as 'prompt' is either adopted directly in Spanish AI contexts or translated as 'instrucción' or 'solicitud', but not 'invitación'.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent of an informative podcast conversation is generally conveyed, and the explanatory analogies are translated well, maintaining their purpose. However, the inconsistent addressing of Camille (shifting between singular and plural 'you' forms, and varying formality) detracts significantly from the natural conversational flow expected in a podcast between two hosts. This makes the dialogue feel less authentic and adapted to the spoken format.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Two distinct sentences containing important explanatory information were entirely omitted from the translation. Specifically, Luc's line 'Il apprendra le français à une vitesse incroyable' and 'Il ne part pas de zéro ; il s'appuie sur des fondations extrêmement solides' were not translated. These omissions significantly impact the completeness and nuance of the information conveyed, leaving gaps in the explanation of key AI concepts.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation presents a mixed quality. While many technical terms are handled correctly and the overall structure of the conversation is preserved, significant flaws in fluency, readability, and information completeness detract from its effectiveness. The most critical issues are the omission of key explanatory sentences, several grammatical and formatting errors (like the 'Final Translation' artifact and incorrect punctuation), and the inconsistent and unnatural use of 'you' forms throughout the dialogue. The mistranslation of 'prompt' is also a notable terminology error. These combined issues indicate a need for a thorough review to enhance accuracy, naturalness, and completeness."
