    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The presence of extensive meta-commentary, instructions, and system-generated text (e.g., \"generated by ChatGPT\", \"User: What is the Spanish translation...\", \"Note: No quotation marks necessary\", \"Justification:\", \"Explanation of the translation:\", \"Translation in English:\", \"¡Excelente! Your final Spanish translation is:\") renders the output completely unreadable as a coherent translation. The actual translated segments are buried and fragmented, making it impossible to follow the intended content.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Due to the pervasive inclusion of non-translation text and fragmented sentences, the output entirely lacks naturalness and fluency. It reads like a disordered log of a translation process rather than a smooth, natural conversation in Spanish. There is no flow between speakers or sentences, making it impossible to evaluate linguistic smoothness.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While some individual technical terms like \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", and \"ventana de contexto\" are translated correctly when they appear, the overall consistency and appropriateness of terminology cannot be adequately assessed due to the fragmented and polluted nature of the output. The term \"ancraje\" for \"grounding\" is a less common choice than \"fundamentación\" or \"enraizamiento\" in technical AI contexts. The constant interruptions prevent any deep evaluation of how terms are introduced or explained.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original French text is a podcast transcript, designed to be conversational and informative. The translated output completely fails to adapt to this context. The interspersed meta-commentary, incomplete sentences, and general chaos destroy any semblance of a podcast dialogue, making it utterly unsuitable for its intended purpose. The tone, style, and flow of a natural conversation are entirely lost.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is severely incomplete. Many original speaker turns are either partially translated, completely replaced by meta-commentary, or mixed with instructions and evaluations. Critical information from the original podcast discussion is missing or obscured by the overwhelming amount of extraneous text, making it impossible to follow the conversation's content or arguments.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "This output is not a translation of the provided French text. Instead, it appears to be a heavily contaminated transcript of an interaction with a translation tool, including user prompts, bot responses, meta-commentary, notes, justifications, and incomplete segments. As a result, it is entirely unusable as a Spanish translation of the podcast transcript. It fails to meet fundamental requirements for readability, fluency, completeness, and contextual adaptation."
