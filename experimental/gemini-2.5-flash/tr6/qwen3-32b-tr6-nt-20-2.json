    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally easy to follow and understand. The sentence structures are mostly clear and the flow of the conversation is logical. However, some minor awkward phrasing exists, and the inconsistent bolding of speaker names (e.g., 'Luc: **Luc:**') slightly detracts from the visual readability and overall polish of the text.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several grammatical errors, such as incorrect gender agreement ('Las idiomas' instead of 'Los idiomas', 'Las nuevas conocimientos' instead of 'Los nuevos conocimientos') and verb conjugation ('La IA no se afinada' instead of 'La IA no es afinada' or 'La IA no se refina'). The inconsistent use of 'tú' and 'usted' throughout the dialogue makes it sound unnatural and unprofessional for native Spanish speakers, as the original 'vous' was consistently used. Additionally, some phrases are translated too literally, leading to less natural expressions (e.g., 'Vean ustedes mismos' for 'Voyez plutôt'). The redundant speaker name formatting is also a significant fluency issue.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as 'preentrenamiento', 'afinamiento', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)', 'anclaje (grounding)', and 'prompt' are all accurately translated and consistently applied throughout the text. The inclusion of the English term 'grounding' in parentheses is a helpful and appropriate choice for clarity in a technical context.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall tone of a tech podcast is generally maintained, and the analogies used in the original text (e.g., university graduate, physicist, learning to ride a bike) are well-preserved and effective in Spanish. However, the inconsistent formal/informal address (switching between 'tú' and 'usted') is a major detractor, as it changes the implied relationship with the listener from the original consistent 'vous'. Some idiomatic expressions are also translated too literally, losing their original nuance. The formatting of speaker names also lacks proper adaptation to common Spanish transcription practices.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French text has been accurately conveyed in the Spanish translation. There are no notable omissions or additions that alter the meaning or scope of the content. The explanations of complex concepts are complete and mirror the source text's clarity and conciseness.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation effectively transfers all the informational content and maintains appropriate technical terminology, which are strong points. However, the overall quality is significantly hampered by issues related to fluency and contextual adaptation. The inconsistent use of formal and informal address ('tú' vs. 'usted'), several grammatical errors, and overly literal translations of idiomatic expressions make the text sound less natural and polished to a native Spanish speaker. Additionally, the redundant and inconsistent formatting of speaker names detracts from the professional presentation of the podcast transcript. Addressing these linguistic and formatting inconsistencies would substantially improve the translation's quality."
