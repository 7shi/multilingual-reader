    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally understandable, but several grammatical errors (gender/number agreement), inconsistent address forms (vosotros/ustedes), and awkward phrasing make it less smooth to read. Some sentences are longer and more convoluted than necessary, and a direct translation of 'l'affinage' as a standalone line disrupts the dialogue flow.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation frequently lacks naturalness for a native Spanish speaker. There are numerous grammatical mistakes, especially with gender and number agreement ('el poder', 'los conocimientos', 'las herramientas') and verb conjugations ('no se afinar'). The inconsistent use of 'vosotros' and 'ustedes' is highly disruptive. Many phrases feel overly literal and do not align with natural Spanish conversational patterns.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as 'pre-entrenamiento', 'afinamiento', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'aprendizaje contextual' (ICL), and 'anclaje' are generally translated correctly. However, there is inconsistent hyphenation for 'pre-entrenamiento'. A significant omission was the explanation of 'fenêtre de contexte' (context window) which is crucial technical detail. While the terms themselves are mostly appropriate, their surrounding context often suffers from fluency issues.",

    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall informative intent of the podcast is conveyed, but the natural, conversational tone of the original is diminished due to grammatical errors and unnatural phrasing. The inconsistency in formal/informal address forms significantly detracts from the contextual adaptation, creating an uneven dialogue. Some literal translations, like '¿En qué se basa?' for 'C'est-à-dire ?', do not fully capture the original conversational nuance.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A key piece of information was omitted: Luc's explanation that In-Context Learning is enabled by 'l'expansion massive de la mémoire à court terme de l'IA, ou « fenêtre de contexte »'. This is an important technical detail. Other information is largely present, but some rephrasing slightly alters the original meaning (e.g., 'reinicias un contexto vacío' vs 'you start from an empty context'). There are also some minor redundancies.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully conveys the core concepts regarding AI learning processes. However, its overall quality is considerably affected by numerous grammatical errors, especially in gender and number agreement, and inconsistent verb conjugations. The lack of consistency in addressing the audience (mixing 'vosotros' and 'ustedes') significantly impacts fluency and readability. While technical terms are mostly accurate, the surrounding language often feels unnatural or too literal, and a critical technical detail about the 'context window' was omitted. Extensive editing for grammar, consistency, and natural phrasing is required."
