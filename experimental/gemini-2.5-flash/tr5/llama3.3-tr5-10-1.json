    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally easy to understand, with clear explanations of complex AI concepts using accessible analogies. Sentence structures are mostly logical. However, some grammatical errors (\"las informaciones\") and the inconsistent use of formal/informal address (tú/usted) slightly disrupt the flow and require minor mental adjustments for the reader, preventing a perfect score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation suffers from noticeable inconsistencies in the use of formal (\"usted\") and informal (\"tú\") address throughout the dialogue, which sounds unnatural to native Spanish speakers in a conversational context. There are also several grammatical errors, such as \"las informaciones\" (should be \"la información\") and \"la IA no se afinada\" (should be \"no se afina\"). Vocabulary choices like \"la solicitud\" for \"prompt\" and \"pista\" for \"antisèche\" could be more natural or precise in a technical discussion. Punctuation (missing initial question/exclamation marks) also detracts from fluency.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", and \"anclaje\" are translated correctly. However, \"afinamiento\" for \"fine-tuning\" is acceptable but less common than \"ajuste fino\" or \"sintonización fina\" in the tech domain, although the English term is helpfully provided in parentheses once. \"La solicitud\" is a less appropriate translation for \"prompt\" than \"el prompt\" (as a loanword) or \"la instrucción\". The full translation of \"ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\" is redundant after \"aprendizaje en contexto\" has just been stated.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation successfully maintains the conversational tone and the pedagogical intent of the original podcast. The analogies used to explain complex concepts are well-preserved and effective. However, the inconsistent use of formal and informal address ('tú' and 'usted') throughout the dialogue is a significant detractor, as it creates an awkward and unnatural dynamic between the speakers, failing to fully adapt to a consistent and culturally appropriate conversational style in Spanish.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French text has been accurately conveyed in the Spanish translation without any significant omissions. The key concepts and explanations are all present, ensuring that the target audience receives the same level of detail and understanding as the source. There are no redundant additions that detract from clarity, beyond a minor, understandable repetition for the ICL acronym.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation provides a largely complete and understandable rendition of the technical discussion. It effectively conveys complex AI concepts and maintains the original podcast's instructional intent. However, its overall quality is significantly hampered by inconsistent address (formal vs. informal 'tú'/'usted') and several grammatical errors (\"las informaciones\", \"se afinada\"), which detract from its naturalness and fluency in Spanish. While technical terminology is mostly handled well, some choices could be improved for better domain-specific naturalness. Addressing these grammatical and consistency issues would significantly improve the translation quality."
