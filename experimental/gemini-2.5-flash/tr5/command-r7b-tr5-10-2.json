    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely understandable, but grammatical errors like \"¡Olvídate de todo!\" (a command instead of a statement) and \"no se afinó constantemente\" (incorrect tense) disrupt the flow and require re-reading. The incorrect translation of \"pré-entraînement\" to \"fase de calentamiento\" also creates a significant point of confusion for a reader familiar with the topic. Despite these issues, the overall structure allows for a general comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several grammatical errors (\"Transferencia de sus habilidades\" missing verb, \"¡Por qué\" instead of \"¿Por qué?\", \"se recuerda\" for 'remembers', \"¡Olvídate de todo!\" for 'It forgets everything', \"no se afinó\" for 'is not fine-tuned') severely impact fluency. The inconsistent use of formal/informal address (\"ustedes\" vs \"tú\") and some awkward phrasing like \"memoria para uso único\" make the text less natural for a native speaker. Redundancy such as \"para el próximo para el próximo\" also reduces naturalness.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The translation of \"pré-entraînement\" as \"fase de calentamiento\" is a critical error in technical terminology, as it changes the meaning significantly within the context of AI model training. Other terms like \"connaissances\" (knowledge) being translated as \"habilidades\" (skills) and \"compétence\" (skill/competence) also sometimes as \"conocimiento\" (knowledge) show a lack of precision. \"Antisèche\" translated as \"guía\" also misses the specific informal meaning of a cheat sheet.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent of explaining AI concepts is conveyed. However, inconsistencies in formal address (mixing \"ustedes\" and \"tú\") detract from the intended conversational yet informative tone. The mistranslation of key concepts and grammatical errors also weaken the persuasive and explanatory power that the original text had, making the adaptation less effective for an audience expecting a clear technical explanation.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key pieces of information from the original text are present in the translation. There are no omissions. However, the accuracy and clarity of some information are compromised by significant terminology errors (e.g., \"pré-entraînement\") and grammatical mistakes that alter meaning (e.g., \"¡Olvídate de todo!\"), potentially leading to misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the conveyed concepts.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation provides a general understanding of the source text but is significantly marred by multiple grammatical errors, inconsistent formality, and critical mistranslations of technical terms, particularly \"pré-entraînement.\" While readable at a surface level, its fluency and precision are compromised, making it less reliable and professional than desired for a technical podcast. Substantial editing would be required to bring it to a publishable standard."
