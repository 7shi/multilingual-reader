    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The 'translation' provided is not a coherent dialogue but a fragmented collection of responses to what appear to be individual sentence translation requests, often including meta-commentary, instructions, and unrelated Spanish language lessons within the JSON values. This makes the entire text completely unreadable and incomprehensible as a continuous conversation. For example, Luc's lines often include full explanations of Spanish grammar or entirely different content about 'library' or 'how old are you?', which are not part of the original podcast.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text lacks any semblance of fluency or naturalness. The constant interruption of the dialogue with extraneous information, instructions, and irrelevant content makes it impossible to read as a natural Spanish conversation. Phrases are often in all caps (e.g., 'ESTÁS EN LO CORRECTO'), and entire segments are replaced with unrelated sentences (e.g., 'Mi hermano y yo vamos a la biblioteca los sábados por la mañana.'), completely breaking any flow or natural expression.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While some technical terms like 'pre-entrenamiento,' 'ajuste fino,' 'aprendizaje por transferencia,' and 'ventana de contexto' are correctly identified and translated in isolation, their placement within the highly fragmented and irrelevant surrounding text makes it impossible to evaluate their consistent and appropriate use in context. The issue is less about the individual term choice and more about the overwhelming presence of non-translation content.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation completely fails to adapt to the original context of an AI-focused podcast. The dialogue is replaced with unrelated content, Spanish language lessons, and internal processing notes. This demonstrates a complete breakdown in understanding and conveying the original intent and purpose of the text. For instance, Luc's explanation about AI learning is replaced by a lesson on asking age in Spanish.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Crucial information from the original French text is consistently omitted or replaced with irrelevant content. Many of Luc and Camille's lines bear no resemblance to the original dialogue, instead containing instructions, meta-commentary, or entirely different sentences. This leads to a catastrophic loss of information, making the 'translation' utterly incomplete and misleading regarding the original content.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "This 'translation' is entirely unusable. It fails to translate the original French dialogue into coherent Spanish, instead presenting a series of fragmented responses that often include internal prompts, instructions, meta-commentary, and completely unrelated Spanish language lessons. It does not convey the original meaning, context, or flow of the conversation, demonstrating a severe failure across all evaluation criteria."
