    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely incomprehensible. Many segments are not cohesive sentences but lists of terms, definitions, or entirely incorrect statements. Grammatical errors are abundant (e.g., \"Holá\", \"La preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje seguir\", \"Aprendrá la QUANTITÉ y FRANAIS también\", \"ello\", \"ídela manera\"). A native Spanish speaker would struggle immensely to understand the content or follow the conversation flow.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text completely lacks fluency and naturalness. It frequently breaks from sentence structure into disjointed lists of words or off-topic explanations. The pervasive grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent style make it sound unnatural and jarring to a native speaker. Many parts are simply not Spanish prose.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While some technical terms are correctly identified and translated *when presented in lists* (e.g., 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'pre-entrenamiento'), their application within sentences is severely flawed or absent. Terms like 'afilado' for 'affinage' are less common than 'ajuste fino', and 'fenestra de contexto' is not standard. The overarching issue is the failure to integrate these terms into a coherent and meaningful context, rendering their individual correctness moot.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation completely fails to convey the original text's intent and purpose, which was a conversational explanation of AI learning. Instead, large portions are replaced by keyword lists, unrelated definitions, or even English text. The conversational tone is lost, and the explanatory nature is undermined by the disjointed and often nonsensical output. There is no effective adaptation to the target context.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Information completeness is severely lacking. Many sentences from the original French are entirely omitted or replaced by irrelevant content, such as lists of terms, external links, or generic greetings. Crucial explanations, analogies, and the logical flow of the discussion are lost. Significant portions of the dialogue are simply not translated, leading to massive information loss.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation is critically flawed and largely unusable. It is not a cohesive translation of the source text, but rather a fragmented collection of partially translated terms, definitions, and numerous instances of incorrect, nonsensical, or entirely irrelevant content. Pervasive grammatical errors, missing sentence structures, and the presence of extraneous system comments or English text make it incomprehensible and demonstrate a severe failure across all aspects of translation quality. It does not effectively convey the original meaning or intent."
