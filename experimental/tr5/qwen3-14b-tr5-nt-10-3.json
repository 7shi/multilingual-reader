  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally understandable, and the concepts are explained clearly. However, several grammatical inconsistencies, particularly with gender and number agreement for 'conocimiento(s)' (e.g., 'Las conocimientos' instead of 'Los conocimientos') and the frequent, inconsistent switching between 'tú' and 'usted' forms for direct address, make the text less smooth and sometimes jarring to read for a native speaker. The untranslated term 'antisèche' also slightly reduces immediate clarity.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The inconsistent use of 'tú' and 'usted' forms throughout the dialogue is the most significant detractor from naturalness. French 'vous' can be ambiguous, but Spanish requires a definite choice for singular or plural, and formal or informal address. The constant switching creates an awkward flow. Additionally, grammatical errors like 'Las conocimientos' and 'pocas nuevas informaciones' are very noticeable and unnatural. Leaving 'antisèche' untranslated also hinders fluency.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as 'preentrenamiento', 'afinamiento' (with 'fine-tuning' in parentheses), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto', and 'anclaje' (with 'grounding' in parentheses) are consistently and appropriately translated. The term 'prompt' is retained, which is common practice in the tech domain in Spanish. The choices made for technical vocabulary are highly accurate and align with standard usage in AI discourse.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation successfully conveys the original text's intent as a conversational podcast explaining complex AI concepts. The analogies used (school, consultant, biking) are well-preserved and fit the context. However, the previously mentioned inconsistent use of 'tú' and 'usted' forms slightly compromises the natural conversational flow expected in such a context, preventing a perfect score in adapting the tone consistently.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original French text is accurately conveyed in the Spanish translation. There are no notable omissions, and the explanations provided in the source are fully retained. The content is concise and clear without unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely accurate in conveying the technical content and the core message of the podcast episode. Key AI terminologies are handled very well. However, the overall quality is significantly impacted by grammatical errors, particularly concerning gender/number agreement for 'conocimiento(s)', and a highly inconsistent use of formal ('usted') and informal ('tú') address forms throughout the dialogue. These issues make the text less fluid and natural for a native Spanish speaker, detracting from what could otherwise be a high-quality translation."
