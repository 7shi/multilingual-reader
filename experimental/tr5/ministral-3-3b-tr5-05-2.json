    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally understandable, but some sentences are awkward or grammatically incorrect, requiring the reader to pause or re-read. Examples include the redundant 'aprendizaje por contexto en contexto' and the incorrect gender agreement 'Las nuevas conocimientos'. The flow is often interrupted by overly literal translations from French.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation frequently reads like a literal rendering of French, leading to unnatural expressions and sentence structures in Spanish. Conversational elements such as 'Exactement!' or 'C'est-à-dire ?' are either omitted or poorly adapted, making the dialogue less natural. Word choices like 'las mismas palabras' are incorrect in context, and others like 'resumen' for 'antisèche' miss the original nuance.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While terms like 'preentrenamiento' and 'ajuste fino' are handled correctly, there is a critical error in the explanation of 'ICL'. It's mistranslated and misexplained as 'Capa de Cachado de Inferencia (ICL, aprendizaje por contexto en contexto)', which is incorrect and highly confusing. This specific error significantly impacts the accuracy of technical information. The term 'affinée' from 'fine-tuning' is also simplified to 'ajusta' in one instance, losing specificity.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation struggles to fully adapt the conversational and engaging tone of a podcast. Numerous conversational cues (e.g., 'Exactement!', 'Donc,', 'Merci de nous avoir écoutés') are omitted, diminishing the dynamic of the dialogue. Questions are sometimes rephrased as statements, altering the interactive feel. The analogy of 'une antisèche' (cheat sheet) is softened to 'un resumen' (summary), losing its original, more playful impact. The inconsistency in the podcast title ('Tech Flash' in intro, 'Tech Éclair' in outro) is also an issue.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "There are multiple omissions throughout the text, including conversational fillers, specific details like 'sur Internet' or 'Il ne part pas de zéro', and parts of analogies. Most critically, the detailed explanation of how the 'memory' feature in chatbots actually works – by searching past exchanges and inserting relevant snippets into the prompt – is almost entirely missing. This omission leaves a significant gap in a core informational segment of the podcast, severely impacting the completeness of the explanation.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation presents several deficiencies across all evaluated criteria. While some parts convey the general meaning, significant information is omitted, and key technical terms are mistranslated or poorly explained, particularly regarding 'ICL' and the 'memory' feature. The fluency and readability suffer from overly literal phrasing and grammatical errors, making the text feel unnatural and less engaging than the original French podcast. The conversational tone is also weakened by the loss of direct address and natural interjections."
