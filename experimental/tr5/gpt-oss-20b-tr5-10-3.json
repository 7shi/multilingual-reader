    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text flows very naturally and smoothly, mirroring the conversational tone of a podcast. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary, and grammar is consistently accurate. There are no awkward or unnatural expressions; the dialogue sounds authentic to a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled with great precision and consistency. Terms like 'preentrenamiento', 'ajuste fino', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto', and 'anclaje' are translated accurately. The inclusion of the original English terms in parentheses (e.g., 'fine-tuning', 'In-Context Learning', 'grounding') is an excellent decision that enhances clarity and caters to an audience likely familiar with these terms in English, without being redundant.",

The informal yet informative tone is maintained throughout. Analogies are well-adapted and resonate culturally with Spanish speakers (e.g., 'cramer para un examen' for 'bachotage', 'hoja de trucos' for 'antis√®che'). The conversational dynamic between Camille and Luc is also effectively conveyed.",
