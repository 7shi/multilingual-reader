    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text sounds exceptionally natural and smooth to a native Spanish speaker. The vocabulary choices are appropriate, contemporary, and fit the informal yet informative tone of a podcast. There are no unnatural expressions or awkward grammatical constructions. The choices like 'bachatear' for 'bachotage' and 'guía rápida' for 'antisèche' are particularly noteworthy for their naturalness and cultural adaptation.",

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled expertly and consistently throughout the translation. Common and correct Spanish equivalents such as 'pre-entrenamiento', 'ajuste fino', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', and 'anclaje' are used. The inclusion of English terms in parentheses (e.g., 'fine-tuning', 'grounding') is highly beneficial for technical accuracy and caters to a broader audience, ensuring consistency and clarity.",
