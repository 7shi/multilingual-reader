    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely clear and easy to understand. Sentence structures are logical and flow well, generally mirroring the original's communicative style. The explanations of complex concepts are well-presented. Minor issues with naturalness and occasional grammatical slips (gender agreement, awkward phrasing) do not severely impede overall comprehension but prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While many sentences read naturally, there are several instances where the phrasing feels somewhat awkward or directly translated from French rather than idiomatic Spanish. For example, \"se ataque a la mecánica cuántica\" should be \"se enfrente a\" or \"aborde\"; \"reaprendizar qué es un verbo\" should be \"volver a aprender lo que es un verbo\". There are also grammatical errors such as \"Las conocimientos\" (should be \"Los conocimientos\") and \"es una truco\" (should be \"es un truco\"). A significant issue is the use of \"bachorear\" which is not a standard Spanish word for \"cramming\" (\"empollar\" or \"estudiar de carrerilla\" would be correct). This breaks a crucial analogy. The inconsistency in using \"afinado\" and \"afinamiento\" also detracts slightly from the flow.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento/afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly translated and are standard in Spanish AI discourse. \"Anclaje\" for \"grounding\" is also correct. The term \"prompt\" is correctly kept as is. The main deduction comes from the problematic translation of \"bachoter\" (a verb used for an analogy explaining a technical concept) to \"bachorear\", which is not a proper Spanish term and affects the understanding of the core concept being explained.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue format and the overall tone of a casual yet informative tech podcast are mostly maintained. The analogies, apart from the mistranslation of \"bachoter\", are generally well-preserved and fit the context. The consistent use of \"usted\" is appropriate for the target audience and podcast format. However, the failure to correctly translate the crucial \"bachoter\" analogy significantly weakens the effectiveness of explaining the core concept, hindering the contextual intent to clarify complex AI learning mechanisms.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French text is present in the Spanish translation. There are no noticeable omissions or significant additions. The explanations are conveyed adequately, and the core message is intact, despite the aforementioned fluency and terminology issues which affect *how* clearly some information is conveyed, rather than its presence or absence.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully conveys the core information of the podcast episode and generally uses appropriate technical terminology for AI concepts. However, it suffers from several instances of awkward phrasing, grammatical errors (gender agreement), and most notably, the mistranslation of a key analogy (\"bachoter\" to \"bachorear\") which significantly undermines the clarity of a central explanatory point. While readable, these issues prevent it from achieving a natural and polished native-like flow. Regular proofreading for naturalness and grammatical accuracy would greatly improve the quality."
