    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is highly unreadable. Numerous segments of the original French text have been replaced by the AI's own conversational interjections or prompts (e.g., \"Escriba en español\", \"Hola mundo\", \"Muestre solo el texto de traducción solicitada\", \"El texto no fue proporcionado para traducir.\", \"Hola\"). This makes it impossible for a reader to follow the conversation or understand the intended content.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The fluency is completely destroyed by the inserted text and omissions. The natural flow of the dialogue is repeatedly broken, making the text sound extremely unnatural and nonsensical as a continuous conversation. There are many instances where the AI appears to be talking to itself or generating instructions instead of translating.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "In the few instances where technical terms are actually translated (e.g., 'pre-entraînement' to 'preentrenamiento', 'fine-tuning' to 'afinamiento', 'apprentissage par transfert' to 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'fenêtre de contexte' to 'ventana de contexto', 'ancrage' to 'anclaje'), the choices are generally appropriate. However, a significant portion of the original text containing technical explanations is missing, which heavily impacts the overall quality.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original context of a podcast conversation explaining AI concepts is entirely lost. The numerous insertions and omissions mean the translated text fails to convey the intent or purpose of the original dialogue. The conversational tone and the logical progression of ideas are completely disrupted.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is severely incomplete. Large sections of the original French text are missing, replaced by irrelevant phrases or prompts from the AI. Key explanations and dialogue points are omitted, rendering the 'translation' practically useless for conveying the information presented in the source text. For example, Luc's detailed explanation of pre-training and several other crucial points are entirely absent.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation is critically flawed. The AI repeatedly failed to translate entire segments of the original text, instead inserting its own conversational prompts or filler phrases ('Hola', 'Escriba en español', 'Muestre solo el texto de traducción solicitada', etc.). This resulted in a highly incomplete, incoherent, and unreadable output that does not serve as a translation of the source material. The fundamental purpose of translation – to convey information from one language to another – was not met in this instance."
