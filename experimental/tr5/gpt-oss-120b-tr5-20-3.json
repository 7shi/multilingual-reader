      "score": 20
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text reads exceptionally naturally in Spanish. The vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, and the grammatical constructions are idiomatic. There are no awkward expressions or phrases that would sound unnatural to a native Spanish speaker. The dialogue flows seamlessly, accurately reflecting the original French conversation.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled with great precision and consistency. Concepts like 'pré-entraînement' (pre-entrenamiento), 'affinage' (afinamiento), 'apprentissage par transfert' (aprendizaje por transferencia), 'fenêtre de contexte' (ventana de contexto), 'apprentissage en contexte' (aprendizaje en contexto), and 'ancrage' (anclaje) are translated accurately. The practice of including the English equivalent in parentheses for terms like 'fine-tuning' and 'grounding' further enhances clarity without cluttering the text.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation perfectly captures the intent and purpose of the original podcast. The tone is consistently informative and conversational, suitable for an explanatory tech podcast. The analogies used in the original (e.g., 'young university graduate', 'consultant', 'cramming for an exam', 'riding a bike') are all effectively transferred and maintain their illustrative power in Spanish. There are no cultural missteps, and the adaptation feels entirely natural for a Spanish-speaking audience.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original French text is conveyed in the Spanish translation without any omissions or distortions. The explanations of AI concepts are complete and accurate. The dialogue's logical progression and the distinction between temporary knowledge (ICL) and permanent skill (fine-tuning) are clearly maintained, ensuring the reader receives all the intended information concisely and clearly.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "This is an outstanding translation that demonstrates exceptional linguistic proficiency in both French and Spanish. The translator has not only accurately conveyed the meaning but also perfectly captured the conversational tone and pedagogical intent of the original podcast. The technical terminology is handled expertly, and the text reads as if it were originally written in Spanish. It is a highly professional and effective translation."
