    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation's readability is significantly hampered by inconsistent pronoun usage when addressing the listener. It switches between 'tú' (informal singular), 'usted' (formal singular), 'ustedes' (formal plural, common in Latin America), and 'vosotros' (informal plural, specific to Spain). This makes the text jarring and difficult to follow who is being addressed. There are also a couple of grammatical errors like 'las conocimientos' (should be 'los conocimientos') and 'haber nos escuchado' (should be 'habernos escuchado'), which further detract from clarity. While the core concepts are understandable, these issues create unnecessary cognitive load.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The inconsistent pronoun usage is the primary reason for a low fluency score. It creates a highly unnatural reading experience for a native Spanish speaker. A consistent form of address (e.g., 'ustedes' for a general audience podcast) is crucial for natural flow. Grammatical errors such as 'las conocimientos' and 'haber nos escuchado' also make the text sound awkward and unpolished. Some phrases are a bit literal translations, like 'Eso es exactamente lo que quiero decir' for 'C'est tout à fait ça', which while understandable, could be more naturally phrased.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The translation handles technical terminology very well. Terms like 'preentrenamiento', 'afinamiento' (with 'fine-tuning' in parentheses), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)', and 'anclaje (grounding)' are all accurately translated and consistently used. The loanword 'prompt' is correctly retained. The explanation for 'bachoter' ('memorizar de forma superficial') is also apt. The only minor point is 'una trampa' for 'une antisèche' ('cheat sheet'), which, while conveying the meaning, might be slightly harsher in tone than intended for a casual podcast. Overall, this is the strongest aspect of the translation.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "While the translation attempts to maintain the conversational and informative tone of a podcast, the severe inconsistencies in addressing the audience ('tú', 'usted', 'ustedes', 'vosotros') undermine this effort. A podcast typically maintains a consistent, often plural formal ('ustedes') or plural informal ('vosotros' for Spain-specific audience) address. This constant switching disrupts the listener's connection to the hosts and makes the dialogue less engaging and professional. The use of 'vosotros' also limits the adaptation for a broader Spanish-speaking audience (e.g., Latin America).",

    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French text is accurately conveyed in the Spanish translation. There are no noticeable omissions, additions, or misinterpretations of the content. The explanations of complex AI concepts are fully preserved, and the analogies used to clarify them are also translated effectively.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation effectively conveys all the technical information and concepts from the original French podcast, with particular strength in accurately rendering technical terminology. However, its overall quality is significantly compromised by a pervasive and inconsistent use of pronouns when addressing the audience (shifting between 'tú', 'usted', 'ustedes', and 'vosotros'). This major flaw severely impacts the fluency, readability, and naturalness of the text, making it sound jarring and unprofessional. Additionally, a few grammatical errors further detract from the polish. While the content is complete, the execution of the address hinders the overall quality of what should be a smooth, conversational podcast transcript."
