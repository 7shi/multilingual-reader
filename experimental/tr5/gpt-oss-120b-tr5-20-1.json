    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text sounds extremely natural and smooth to a native Spanish speaker. There are no awkward grammatical constructions or unnatural expressions. Vocabulary choices, such as \"levantar el velo,\" \"cajas negras,\" \"empollar para un examen,\" and \"chuleta,\" are idiomatic and perfectly fit the context, enhancing the naturalness of the conversation.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "All technical terms are appropriately translated and consistently used throughout the text. Key terms like \"pre-entrenamiento,\" \"afinamiento\" (with fine-tuning in parentheses), \"aprendizaje por transferencia,\" \"ventana de contexto,\" \"aprendizaje en contexto,\" and \"anclaje\" (with grounding in parentheses) are handled with precision. The inclusion of the English terms in parentheses for 'afinamiento' and 'anclaje' is a good practice for clarity in a technical context.",
