    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The readability is hindered by several factors. There are consistent grammatical errors, such as using 'las informaciones' instead of 'la información'. Some sentences are direct, literal translations from French, making them sound unnatural or clunky in Spanish. Missing question marks at the end of some interrogative sentences also detract from readability. A significant issue is an orphaned sentence ('aprendizaje en contexto en acción. La totalidad del historial de su discusión en esta sesión constituye el contexto') which is grammatically incomplete and confusing without its preceding context from the original text.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation lacks naturalness in several places. Idiomatic expressions like 'lever le voile' are translated literally or simplified ('revelar' instead of 'levantar el velo'), losing some of the original text's flair. The inconsistent use of 'tú' and 'usted' (e.g., 'tus discusiones' vs. 'que usted proporciona') creates an awkward and non-native tone. Grammatical errors, especially the repeated 'las informaciones', significantly impact fluency. Phrases like 'se hace posible gracias a' could be more smoothly rendered as 'es posible gracias a', and 'se ajusta' is not the most appropriate verb for 'affinée' in this context. The missing opening to Luc's explanation about ICL also creates a jarring break in the dialogue flow.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The technical terminology is handled very well. Terms like 'preentrenamiento', 'afinado (fine-tuning)', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)', and 'anclaje (grounding)' are accurately translated and consistently used. The inclusion of the English terms in parentheses for 'fine-tuning', 'ICL', and 'grounding' is a good practice that aids understanding in a technical context. Analogies such as 'empollar' for 'bachoter' and 'hoja de apuntes' for 'antisèche' are excellent and show good cultural adaptation for specific terms.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to maintain the podcast dialogue format and the educational tone. However, the adaptation is inconsistent. The formality shift between 'tú' and 'usted' is a major issue that clashes with the presumed informal tone of a podcast. The loss of idiomatic expressions in some places ('lever le voile') and the literal translation of others ('sobre esta reflexión') prevent the text from feeling fully natural for a Spanish audience. The missing question marks also affect the perception of conversational questions. The choice of 'artimaña' for 'astuce' is a bit strong for the context; 'truco' or 'mecanismo inteligente' would have been more suitable.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "While most of the information from the original text is conveyed, there is a significant omission that impacts completeness. The beginning of Luc's explanation after Camille's 'Je vois' is missing ('Exactement ! C'est l'apprentissage en contexte en action.'). This makes the translated sentence start abruptly and loses the affirmative and contextualizing lead-in. Minor omissions of punctuation (question marks) also slightly reduce the clarity of questions, though the core information is still present.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation accurately conveys the core technical information and uses appropriate terminology, which is a strong point. However, its overall quality is significantly diminished by issues in fluency, readability, and contextual adaptation. The text is riddled with grammatical errors (e.g., 'las informaciones' instead of 'la información'), overly literal translations that sound unnatural, and an inconsistent formal/informal register. A critical flaw is the omission of part of a speaker's line, resulting in an orphaned and confusing sentence. While the content is understandable, a substantial revision is needed to improve naturalness, correct grammatical errors, and ensure a consistent tone for a native Spanish-speaking audience."
