    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The primary issue affecting readability is the inconsistent use of formal ('usted') and informal ('tú') forms when addressing the listener/audience throughout the dialogue. The original French consistently uses 'vous', which in this context implies a formal address, but the Spanish translation frequently switches between 'usted' and 'tú' forms. For example, Luc asks 'Pueden tomar...' (ustedes) but later says 'No necesitas que te recuerden...' (tú). Camille's question '¿Porque ya entiende...?' incorrectly uses 'Porque' instead of '¿Por qué?' for 'Why?', which is a grammatical error. These inconsistencies make the text jarring and less coherent for a native speaker.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The constant switching between formal and informal address severely impacts the naturalness and fluency of the dialogue in Spanish. It creates an awkward listening experience. While individual sentences are mostly grammatically correct, the lack of a consistent voice for the speakers addressing the audience is unnatural. The direct retention of the French term 'bachotage' without explanation or a more common Spanish equivalent ('empollar', 'estudiar de memoria') also detracts from the fluency for some readers.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are handled appropriately. 'IA', 'pre-entrenamiento', 'afinamiento' (with 'fine-tuning' in parentheses), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'prompt', and 'anclaje' are all correctly translated and commonly used in Spanish technical contexts. The translation of 'Tech Éclair' to 'Tech Relámpago' is a good choice. However, there is a slight inconsistency in using 'aprendizaje en contexto' and 'aprendizaje contextual' interchangeably. The most notable issue is the direct retention of 'bachotage', which is not a standard Spanish technical or common term, making it potentially unclear for the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The tone of a podcast is generally maintained, but the inconsistent formality in addressing the listener ('tú' vs. 'usted') is a significant contextual adaptation issue. A consistent formal address (using 'usted' forms for 'vous') would be more appropriate for an informative podcast setting. The choice of 'chuleta' for 'antisèche' is contextually apt for an informal sense of 'cheat sheet' within a semi-formal podcast, but the retention of 'bachotage' without explanation is less adapted.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All critical information from the original French text has been accurately conveyed in the Spanish translation. The explanations of pre-training, fine-tuning, transfer learning, in-context learning, grounding, and the AI's 'memory' mechanism are fully preserved. No important details were omitted, and no unnecessary redundancy was introduced. The metaphors used in the original text are also maintained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully conveys all the technical information and the core concepts discussed in the podcast. Technical terminology is generally well-handled. However, the overall quality is significantly hampered by a pervasive and inconsistent switching between formal ('usted') and informal ('tú') forms of address for the listener. This grammatical inconsistency, along with a minor error in a question ('¿Porque?' instead of '¿Por qué?'), and the direct retention of 'bachotage' (a French term) without translation, detracts from the readability, fluency, and contextual naturalness of the Spanish text."
