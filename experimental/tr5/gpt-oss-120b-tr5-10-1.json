    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is exceptionally clear and easy to understand. Complex AI concepts are explained with precise and logical sentence structures, making the content accessible for listeners of a podcast. The analogies used in the original text are perfectly transferred, further aiding comprehension.",

    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text flows very naturally, sounding authentic to a native Spanish speaker. The vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary for a tech podcast, and there are no awkward grammatical constructions or unnatural expressions. The conversational tone of the original is perfectly maintained.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled with excellent precision. 'Preentrenamiento', 'afinamiento', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto', and 'anclaje' are all correct and standard terms in the field. The inclusion of English equivalents in parentheses for 'fine-tuning' and 'grounding' is a good practice for clarity, though the Spanish terms themselves are strong. Colloquial equivalents like 'empollar' for 'bachoter' and 'chuleta' for 'antisèche' are spot-on.",
