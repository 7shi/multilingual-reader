    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The readability is significantly hampered by numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and an inconsistent use of address (usted/tú/vosotros). Several sentences feel disjointed or incomplete, making it difficult to follow the natural flow of a conversation. The added parenthetical notes, while sometimes attempting to clarify, often disrupt the reading experience.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "This is the weakest aspect of the translation. There are several instances of unnatural expressions and incorrect grammar, such as 'Desvelar cómo...' as a full sentence, 'Se lo olvida todo' instead of 'Lo olvida todo', 'insiere' instead of 'inserta', and awkward constructions like 'reutiliza sus competencias matemáticas previas'. The inconsistency in 'usted/tú/vosotros' forms also makes the dialogue feel unnatural and jarring for a native speaker. The conversational tone of a podcast is largely lost.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms like 'preentrenamiento', 'afinamiento' (with 'ajuste fino' as a helpful clarification), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto' (ICL), and 'ancrage' (with 'grounding') are translated appropriately and consistently. 'Prompt' is correctly retained. The main detraction is that the overall lack of fluency and contextual adaptation sometimes makes the integration of these terms less smooth.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation struggles to maintain the intent and conversational flow of the original podcast. Key dialogue elements like 'Exactement', 'Précisément', and 'Donc' are frequently omitted, altering the speakers' reactions and the logical progression of ideas. Luc's crucial explanation about 'la différence entre une connaissance temporaire et une compétence permanente' is entirely rephrased, changing the original setup for Camille's subsequent analogy. The added parenthetical explanations and bolding also do not align with a natural podcast script.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "There are several significant omissions and alterations. Luc's second line is heavily truncated, making it an incomplete thought. Camille's second mention of 'pré-entraînement' includes information from a previous line, creating redundancy and misattribution. Crucially, Luc's explanation regarding the distinction between temporary knowledge and permanent competence is completely rewritten and different from the original's intent. Several conversational cues and transitional phrases are missing, and Camille's final question is significantly abridged. These issues lead to a substantial loss of original information and context.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation demonstrates a basic understanding of the source text's content but suffers from significant issues across multiple criteria. The most prominent weaknesses lie in fluency, where grammatical errors, unnatural phrasing, and inconsistent address create a disjointed reading experience. Information completeness is severely compromised by numerous omissions and alterations, particularly in critical explanatory passages. While technical terminology is generally handled well, the overall lack of naturalness and fidelity to the original's conversational intent makes this a low-quality translation for a podcast script."
