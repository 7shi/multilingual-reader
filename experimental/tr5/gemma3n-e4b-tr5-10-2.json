    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally understandable, and complex concepts are explained clearly through well-translated analogies. However, the inconsistent use of second-person pronouns (tú, usted, and vosotros forms) creates a distracting reading experience and detracts from the overall smoothness. There are also a couple of minor typos that impede flow slightly.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The most significant issue affecting fluency is the inconsistent use of address forms (tú, usted, and vosotros). This makes the text sound unnatural and unpolished to a native speaker. For example, 'Podéis tomar' (vosotros) is used, then 'Has entendido' (tú), 'que usted proporciona' (usted), and 'vuestras conversaciones' (vosotros), sometimes even within the same sentence or turn. This lack of consistency is a major grammatical and stylistic flaw. Additionally, 'memorizar de memoria' is redundant, and 'artiñaña' is a non-existent word.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are translated accurately and appropriately, such as 'pre-entrenamiento', 'ajuste fino' (fine-tuning), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto' (ICL), and 'anclaje' (grounding). However, there are a few notable errors: 'Transformeers' is a typo for 'Transformers', 'artiñaña' is a significant error for 'artimaña' ('trick'), and the podcast name 'Tech Éclair' is mistranslated as 'Tech Flash' at the end, which is a critical named entity error. The formatting of '*prompt*' with asterisks is also not ideal for plain text JSON.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation effectively conveys the intent and purpose of a technical podcast. The analogies, such as the university graduate or the consultant, are well-preserved and aid understanding. The initial 'bienvenido/a' is a good adaptation for addressing a general audience. However, the inconsistent use of address forms prevents the establishment of a consistent 'voice' or register for the podcast, which impacts the overall contextual fit.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original text has been conveyed without omission. There are no significant additions or removals of content. The flow of information and the logical progression of ideas are maintained.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully transfers the technical information and the conversational tone of the podcast from French to Spanish. The core concepts are accurately translated, and the explanations are generally clear. However, the quality is significantly undermined by pervasive inconsistencies in the use of second-person pronouns (tú, usted, vosotros), which makes the text sound unnatural and unpolished. Several typos and critical errors in specific terminology and named entities ('artiñaña', 'Transformeers', 'Tech Flash') further detract from the overall professional quality."
