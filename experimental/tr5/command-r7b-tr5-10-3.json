    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation suffers from several grammatical inaccuracies and unnatural phrasing which hinder readability. For instance, the recurring error of translating 'Elle oublie tout' (It forgets everything) as '¡Olvídate de todo!' (Forget everything!) is a command instead of a statement, creating significant confusion. The incorrect technical term 'fase de calentamiento' for 'pré-entraînement' also makes the text less clear for an informed reader. Inconsistent pronoun usage ('partimos' instead of 'partes' or 'se parte') and missing subject pronouns also affect the flow.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation lacks fluency due to a series of grammatical errors, awkward sentence structures, and inconsistent address forms. Examples include 'Transferencia de sus habilidades matemáticas existentes' missing a subject, 'la IA «se recuerda»' which should be 'recuerda', and 'informaciones' (plural) for general 'información' (singular). The switch between 'ustedes' and 'tú' (e.g., 'antes de que empiece a hablar contigo') is also inconsistent and unnatural in a formal/semi-formal podcast context. Some phrasing, like 'Esta es toda la potencia de este enfoque', feels clunky.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The most significant issue is the translation of 'pré-entraînement' as 'la fase de calentamiento', which is incorrect in the context of AI and should be 'preentrenamiento'. While other key terms like 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto', and 'anclaje' are correctly translated, 'ajuste' for 'affinage' could be more precise (e.g., 'ajuste fino' or 'microajuste'). Additionally, 'guía' for 'antisèche' loses the specific nuanced meaning of a 'cheat sheet'. These inconsistencies and one major error detract from the overall technical accuracy.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The core intent of the original text is generally conveyed, but the translation's frequent grammatical and fluency issues, along with some less precise terminology choices, reduce its effectiveness. The conversational tone of the podcast is sometimes lost due to awkward phrasing. The impact of analogies, such as 'bachotage' (cramming) being translated as 'estudiar para un examen' and 'antisèche' (cheat sheet) as 'guía', is weakened as the Spanish equivalents lack the same specific connotation or informal touch.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All critical information from the original text has been carried over into the translation. No significant details were omitted. However, some nuances were lost due to less precise lexical choices (e.g., 'guía' for 'antisèche') or grammatical errors that slightly altered the emphasis or clarity of a statement. There were no superfluous additions or omissions that improved or detracted from clarity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation provides a generally understandable rendition of the source text, correctly translating many technical terms. However, its quality is significantly hampered by numerous grammatical errors, unnatural phrasing, and inconsistent pronoun usage, which severely impact fluency and readability. A critical terminology error ('fase de calentamiento' for 'pre-entrenamiento') and recurring mistranslations of simple declarative sentences as commands ('¡Olvídate de todo!') are particularly notable shortcomings. The text would require substantial editing to achieve a professional standard."
