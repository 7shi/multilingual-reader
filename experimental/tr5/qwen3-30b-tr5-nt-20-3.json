    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally clear, well-structured, and easy to understand for a Spanish-speaking audience. Complex AI concepts are presented in an accessible manner, maintaining the conversational tone of the original podcast. Sentence flow is mostly logical and direct, facilitating comprehension. Minor stylistic preferences for some phrases do not significantly impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While largely natural and smooth, several phrasing choices and inconsistencies slightly detract from perfect fluency. The most notable issue is the switch in formality from 'usted' to 'tú' within the same conversation (e.g., 'hablar contigo' after preceding 'usted' forms for the listener), which breaks the consistent register. Other points include 'la totalidad del historial' which could be smoother, and the slightly formal 'no enseñarían' for a general example, which could be more impersonal or directly addressed.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are translated accurately and appropriately for the AI context, such as 'IA', 'pre-entrenamiento', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto', and 'anclaje'. 'Prompt' and 'Transformers' are correctly retained or adapted. However, there's an inconsistency in translating 'affinage' as both 'ajuste fino' and 'refinamiento' in different parts of the text; 'ajuste fino' is the more precise and widely accepted technical term for 'fine-tuning' in ML. The translation of 'bachotage' shifts between a direct action ('estudiar a última hora') and an explanation ('estudio sin comprensión'), which also shows a minor inconsistency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation effectively conveys the informative yet conversational tone of the original podcast. The explanations of AI concepts are well-adapted for the target audience. However, the inconsistent register (formal 'usted' mixed with informal 'tú') is a significant contextual adaptation issue, as it breaks immersion and might feel jarring to native speakers. The choice of 'consultor temporario' over the more universally understood 'consultor temporal' could also be improved for broader appeal across Spanish-speaking regions.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French text is accurately conveyed in the Spanish translation. There are no significant omissions or additions that alter the core message or factual content. Parenthetical English terms like 'fine-tuning' and 'In-Context Learning' are handled appropriately, either by retention or clear translation. The only minor detail missing is the speaker label 'Camille:' for the 'Pre-entrenamiento' line, which is a structural element of the dialogue rather than an informational omission.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is generally accurate and successfully conveys the meaning and technical information of the original French podcast. It demonstrates a good understanding of AI terminology in Spanish. However, its overall quality is slightly impacted by inconsistencies in terminology, register (formal vs. informal address), and minor phrasing that could be more natural. Addressing these points would significantly enhance its fluency and polish."
