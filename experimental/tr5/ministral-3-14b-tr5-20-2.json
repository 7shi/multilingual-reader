    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally clear and easy to understand. Sentence structures are logical and the flow of information is mostly coherent. However, some abrupt sentence starts due to missing connectors or subjects (e.g., Camille's line about transferring knowledge, her final question) slightly disrupt the natural reading experience. The use of formal 'usted' is consistent and appropriate for the context.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation suffers from several instances where dialogue lines begin abruptly, lacking natural connectors (e.g., Luc's second line, Camille's line about transferring knowledge, her final question). The omission of 'Y yo soy Luc. Hoy vamos a...' in the initial dialogue is a significant detractor from fluency. Some phrasing, like Camille's question '¿cuál es?' in the analogy discussion, sounds slightly unnatural in Spanish. While many parts flow well, these inconsistencies prevent a consistently smooth and natural reading experience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled very well. 'Preentrenamiento,' 'afinamiento,' 'aprendizaje por transferencia,' 'ventana de contexto,' 'aprendizaje en contexto,' and 'anclaje' are all accurate and commonly used in the Spanish-speaking tech community. The translator also appropriately includes alternative Spanish terms ('entrenamiento previo') and the English equivalents (*fine-tuning*, *In-Context Learning*), which enhances clarity and understanding. The term 'prompt' is correctly retained.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation successfully maintains the conversational and informative tone suitable for a tech podcast. The intent and purpose of explaining complex AI concepts in an accessible way are effectively conveyed. The use of formal 'usted/ustedes' is consistent and appropriate for addressing a general audience in this type of content. No cultural mismatches or inappropriate expressions were found.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This criterion has several issues. The most significant omission is a large part of Luc's initial introduction ('Y yo soy Luc. Hoy vamos a...') in the second dialogue line. Another notable omission is the truncation of Luc's analogy about cycling, where 'les lois de l'équilibre à chaque fois que vous montez en selle' is reduced to 'que te lo recuerden.' Additionally, some connecting phrases or subjects are missing in Camille's lines (e.g., 'Donc, il transfère...' becomes 'transfiere...'), which, while inferable, makes the information slightly less explicit than in the original.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation effectively conveys the core technical information and utilizes appropriate terminology for a tech podcast. However, its quality is significantly impacted by several notable omissions and instances of unnatural phrasing or missing connectors, particularly at the beginning of speaker turns. These issues detract from the overall fluency and information completeness, preventing the translation from reaching a higher standard of naturalness and precision, despite strong performance in terminology and contextual adaptation."
