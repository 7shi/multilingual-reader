    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The individual sentences are well-structured and the overall explanation of concepts is clear. However, the inconsistent use of second-person pronouns (switching between \"tú,\" \"usted,\" \"vosotros,\" and \"ustedes\") creates a disjointed reading experience. This forces the reader to mentally adjust, disrupting the flow and making it less effortlessly comprehensible than it could be. For example, \"un recién graduado universitario\" misses an article, and \"presentárselo\" for \"lui présenter\" is an awkward construction.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While many phrases are idiomatic and natural, the major issue is the inconsistent addressing of the listener (mixing \"tú,\" \"usted,\" and \"vosotros\" forms). This is a fundamental error in Spanish fluency and creates an unnatural, erratic tone. Other minor issues include the less common word choice \"artiñaña\" and the grammatically awkward \"presentárselo una cantidad\".",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "All key technical terms are accurately translated and consistently used throughout the text. The inclusion of the English equivalents in parentheses for \"fine-tuning\" and \"grounding\" is a helpful touch that enhances clarity. The only minor issue is a typo (\"Tranformers\" instead of \"Transformers\"), which doesn't affect the overall excellent handling of terminology.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation successfully maintains the informative and accessible tone suitable for a podcast. Analogies are well-preserved and adapted (e.g., \"bachoter\" to \"estudiar superficialmente para un examen\"). The purpose of explaining complex AI concepts clearly is effectively conveyed. However, the inconsistent use of second-person pronouns negatively impacts the direct address to the listener, subtly altering the intended conversational style.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation accurately covers all the information presented in the original text. No crucial details are omitted, and the explanations of complex concepts (like the difference between temporary and permanent AI knowledge) are complete and precise. The concise nature of the original is also preserved.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is strong in its accurate rendering of technical concepts and retention of core information. It successfully explains complex ideas through well-chosen analogies. However, its primary weakness lies in the highly inconsistent use of second-person pronouns (tú, usted, vosotros, ustedes) throughout the dialogue, which significantly detracts from its naturalness and readability for a native Spanish speaker. Addressing this consistency issue would elevate the translation from good to excellent."
