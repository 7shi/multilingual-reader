    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The output is severely fragmented by the inclusion of numerous meta-comments, user instructions, vocabulary lists, and even English text. It does not present as a cohesive, continuous translated text. When attempting to extract only the dialogue, there are still awkward phrasings, grammatical errors ('impractica', 'ingrained' being left in English), and a mix of English and Spanish ('But, ¿qué pasa con'). The crucial introductory lines from Camille are also incomplete, significantly hindering initial comprehension.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The continuous interruptions by non-translation elements drastically disrupt the flow and naturalness. Even in the extracted dialogue, instances of unnatural phrasing ('a utilización única'), grammatical errors ('impractica'), direct English insertions ('ingrained'), and code-switching ('But, ¿qué pasa con') make the text sound very clunky and not natural to a native Spanish speaker. The inconsistent use of 'tú' and 'usted' further detracts from fluency.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Some core technical terms like 'pre-entrenamiento,' 'aprendizaje por transferencia,' and 'ventana de contexto' are translated correctly. 'Afinamiento' is an acceptable choice for 'fine-tuning.' However, 'invitación' for 'prompt' is not the standard technical term, and 'ancoraje' for 'grounding' is less common than 'anclaje' or 'fundamentación' in AI contexts, although 'anclaje' is provided parenthetically. The overall presentation, being fragmented, makes consistent term usage difficult to assess.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fundamentally fails to adapt to the podcast context due to its fragmented nature and the pervasive presence of meta-comments throughout. Camille's introductory lines are severely truncated, failing to establish the podcast's identity and purpose. Additionally, the inconsistent mixing of formal ('usted') and informal ('tú') address forms within the dialogue is inappropriate for a public podcast intended for a general audience.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The very first line of Camille's dialogue ('Bonjour et bienvenue dans « Tech Éclair », le podcast où nous décryptons la technologie qui façonne notre monde. Je suis Camille.') is significantly incomplete in the translation ('Camille: Hola, soy Camille'), omitting the podcast's name and purpose. While most other information from the original dialogue appears to be present in isolated segments, the output's severe fragmentation by extraneous text makes it impossible to convey the complete information coherently or in a usable format.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The provided output is not a coherent or usable translation of the original French text. It is a highly fragmented collection of individual sentence translations, heavily interspersed with meta-comments, user instructions, vocabulary lists, and even English text. This renders the 'translation' practically unreadable as a continuous piece of text. While some individual translated phrases and technical terms are accurate, the overall lack of cohesion, frequent grammatical errors (e.g., 'ingrained', 'impractica'), code-switching ('But, ¿qué pasa con'), inconsistent address forms (tú/usted), and significant omissions (like Camille's full introduction) indicate a very low quality translation that falls far short of acceptable standards."
