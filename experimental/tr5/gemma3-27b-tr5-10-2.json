    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is exceptionally clear and easy to understand. Sentence structures are logical and flow naturally, making the complex concepts discussed in the podcast accessible to a Spanish-speaking audience. The dialogue format is maintained effectively, contributing to a smooth reading experience.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text sounds highly natural and smooth to a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary, and there are no instances of awkward grammar or unnatural expressions. The translator effectively adapted idiomatic phrases and conversational interjections, such as choosing 'O sea?' as a natural equivalent for 'C'est-à-dire ?' (though providing multiple options in the output for evaluation purposes), and replacing 'montez en selle' with the more common 'subes a la bici'.",

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled with great precision and awareness. Terms like 'pré-entraînement' (pre-entrenamiento), 'apprentissage par transfert' (aprendizaje por transferencia), 'fenêtre de contexte' (ventana de contexto), and 'apprentissage en contexte' (aprendizaje en contexto) are translated correctly and consistently. For terms commonly used in English in the tech sphere, such as 'fine-tuning' and 'grounding', the translator wisely included both the English term and its appropriate Spanish equivalent ('ajuste fino', 'anclaje'). The functional translation of 'bachotage' to 'memorizar para un examen' and 'antisèche' to 'resumen rápido' demonstrates excellent contextual understanding.",

    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation perfectly conveys the original text's intent and purpose, maintaining the educational and conversational tone suitable for a podcast.
