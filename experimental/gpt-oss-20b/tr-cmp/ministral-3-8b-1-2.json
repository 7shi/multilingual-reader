  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation contains numerous fragmented sentences, untranslated French fragments, and abrupt switches between languages. Key explanatory passages are incomplete or missing, making it difficult for a native Spanish speaker to follow the intended meaning. Consequently, overall readability is very low.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text exhibits several awkward grammatical constructions (e.g., “Camille: we”, “Luc: we simply provide the documents”), improper punctuation, and literal mistranslations. The natural flow of Spanish is compromised, leading to a disjointed reading experience.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Some technical terms are correctly rendered (“preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”), but many others are inconsistent or missing. Abbreviations such as “IA” are used without the necessary article in Spanish (“la IA”), and key concepts like ICL are only partially introduced. Overall terminology handling is moderate but far from optimal.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to preserve the original dialogue’s intent in several places: French interjections and comments remain untranslated, and the cultural nuance of a podcast format is not consistently conveyed. The adaptation is therefore weak.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are omitted or left as French fragments. The speaker turns are cut off or replaced by placeholders (“Camille: we”), resulting in a substantial loss of content. The translation lacks completeness.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a basic grasp of technical vocabulary but suffers from fragmented structure, inconsistent language use, and significant omissions. As a result, the overall quality is inadequate for a faithful, polished Spanish rendition of the original French podcast script. The final product would require extensive revision to meet professional standards for readability, fluency, and completeness, especially for a target audience of Spanish-speaking listeners familiar with AI concepts. The current state is suitable only as a draft needing comprehensive editing and localization refinement. The overall score reflects these shortcomings, indicating the translation falls well below a satisfactory level for publication or broadcast use. A more thorough and culturally attuned revision is strongly recommended before deployment. The score provided is an average of the individual criterion scores, representing a summed overall performance of 5/20, which underscores the need for significant improvement in all assessed areas."
