  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely understandable, with clear sentence structures and logical flow. The speaker turns and explanations are kept in a conversational tone that matches the original. Minor issues such as “Lo entendieron todo” (should be singular) slightly affect clarity, but overall the text is readable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker. However, there are a few awkward expressions, e.g., “Lo entendieron todo” and “la memoria a corto plazo” used inconsistently with the French. These minor syntactic quirks lower the naturalness score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL”, “grounding”. The translation captures the original meaning and uses contemporary terminology suitable for a general audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal, conversational style of the podcast and adapts idiomatic expressions to Spanish culture. It keeps the intended humor and tone. No major cultural mismatches occur, making the adaptation effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. The dialogue flow, explanations, and examples are retained. Minor omissions are negligible and do not impact understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the Spanish translation is of high quality. It faithfully conveys the original content while maintaining readability and technical accuracy. A few syntactic refinements could improve fluency, but the translation effectively serves its intended audience and purpose. The final overall score reflects strong performance across all criteria with only minor room for polishing linguistic details.\n\nScore: 18/20"
