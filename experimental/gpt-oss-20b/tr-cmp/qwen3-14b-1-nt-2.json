  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is understandable in most places, but frequent literal translations and grammatical mistakes (e.g. \"Entienden\" instead of \"Entiendes\" or \"Entienden\" for a single speaker, mixed‑language fragments) make some passages confusing. Sentence structure is usually logical, yet the presence of untranslated French sections interrupts the flow.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sometimes sounds awkward or unnatural, especially with phrases like \"cacharrear\" for \"bachoter\" and the occasional foreign loan words that are not fully adapted to Spanish usage. Overall, the prose feels choppy in several places, lowering its smoothness.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"fin‑tuning\" are generally correct, but there are inconsistencies (e.g., keeping \"fine‑tuning\" as a loan word, using \"cacharrear\" for \"bachoter\", and partially translating \"grounding\"). The terminology is mostly suitable for the intended audience, but not consistently applied.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the intent of the original and uses some culturally appropriate analogies (e.g., consultant vs. expert). However, several sections are left in French, which indicates incomplete adaptation and detracts from the overall effectiveness of the communication.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The bulk of the content is present, and the dialogue structure is maintained. Yet, a handful of original French sentences were not translated, which reduces completeness. There is no excessive redundancy, and missing information is minimal but noticeable.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the main ideas and follows the original dialogue structure, but it is marred by grammatical errors, untranslated fragments, and some awkward phrasing. The translation would benefit from a comprehensive edit to ensure consistency, proper terminology, and full linguistic adaptation. It is acceptable as a rough draft, but not yet polished enough for publication to a native Spanish-speaking audience. The overall quality is moderate, and a higher level of accuracy and naturalness is recommended for a final version."
