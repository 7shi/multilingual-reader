    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, using a clear dialogue format. However, some sentences are a bit long and could be simplified for better flow, especially the ones describing the ICL process. The use of terms like \"ventana de contexto\" and \"prompt\" might confuse readers who are not familiar with the jargon. Overall, the structure remains logical and easy to follow, but a few sentences feel a bit clunky.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most parts and keeps the informal tone of the original. Some expressions are slightly awkward – e.g., \"la IA no se refina constantemente por sus conversaciones\" – and the word order in a few places is not idiomatic. The frequent use of \"prompt\" as a borrowed term is acceptable, but it can feel out of place for readers who prefer a fully Spanish equivalent. The overall fluency is solid but not perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje (grounding)\", \"memoria\". The consistency of term usage is good. Minor issues: the repeated use of \"refina\" could cause confusion (it means both fine‑tune and learn), and \"prompt\" is kept as is, which is common in the field but might be unfamiliar to some Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the informal, conversational style and does not overly literalize idioms, which preserves the original’s intent. Some culturally specific references (e.g., the idea of a consultant being given documents) are translated accurately. However, expressions like \"ventana de contexto\" and the use of \"prompt\" feel a bit too literal for a native Spanish audience. Minor adjustments could improve the local resonance.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue turns and explanations from the original are present. No major omissions or added content. The translation keeps the same sequence and retains the emphasis on key concepts. Minor formatting inconsistencies exist but do not affect understanding.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is a faithful rendering of the French script, capturing the main ideas and maintaining a conversational tone. Readability and fluency are good, though a few sentences could be tightened for natural flow. Terminology is mostly accurate and consistent, with some minor ambiguities. Contextual adaptation is adequate but could benefit from slightly more localized phrasing. The information is complete and no significant details are lost. With a few small adjustments, the translation would be clear, natural, and fully aligned with the original intent. Overall, it is a solid translation deserving of a high score but still leaving room for polishing in style and idiomatic phrasing."
