  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text contains many incomplete sentences, missing clauses, and abrupt switches that make it difficult for a reader to follow the flow of the dialogue. Key lines such as “Luc: desenmascarar” or “Camille: El ajuste fino” are truncated and lack the context needed for comprehension. The overall structure is therefore hard to read.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several sentences are either literally translated without regard for natural phrasing or contain untranslated fragments (e.g., “the difference between temporary knowledge and a permanent skill”). Grammatical errors and abrupt omissions give the text an artificial feel. Native speakers would find it jarring.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms like *pre‑entrenamiento* and *ajuste fino* are present, but the consistency is broken (e.g., sometimes *fine‑tuning* is left in English). Additionally, key concepts such as *in‑context learning* are not consistently rendered or explained, leading to confusion for readers unfamiliar with the terminology.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation does not adequately adapt idiomatic expressions or cultural references to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Phrases that are central to the original (e.g., “expert in English” → “experto en inglés”) are preserved but not always contextualized. Overall, the adaptation is weak.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A significant portion of the dialogue is omitted or cut off, resulting in missing explanations and contextual information. The translation fails to convey the full narrative of the original script, making it incomplete.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is severely incomplete and contains numerous errors in phrasing, terminology, and structure. While some key terms are present, the overall fidelity to the original text is poor, making it unsuitable for clear communication to a target audience. It requires extensive revision to meet basic translation standards for clarity, accuracy, and naturalness in Spanish."
