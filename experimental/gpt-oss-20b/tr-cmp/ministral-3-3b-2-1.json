    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable to a native speaker, but the frequent interjection of explanatory side‑notes (e.g., “Opción 1…”, “Nota clave…”) breaks the flow and makes some passages hard to follow. The basic dialogue structure is preserved, yet readers may get confused by the inserted meta‑commentary. Overall, readability is acceptable but not exemplary.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences read naturally and the chosen vocabulary is contemporary. However, the presence of parenthetical explanations and some awkward wordings (e.g., “se le ha justificado un sistema más inteligente”) reduces the smoothness. The translation feels partially like a mix of a direct translation and a commentary, which diminishes overall fluency.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *transfer learning* and *in‑context learning* are used correctly and consistently in most places. The translator occasionally adds explanatory phrases that are helpful, but some terms are duplicated or phrased differently (e.g., “aprendizaje en contexto” vs. “aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”). Terminology is largely appropriate but could be more uniform.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to adapt the conversation for a Spanish audience (e.g., using ‘Tech Relámpago’ instead of ‘Tech Éclair’). Cultural adaptation is generally adequate, yet the inserted commentary detracts from the original intent and tone. The dialogue’s conversational nature is preserved, but the extra explanations feel out of place for a podcast script.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several parts of the original script are either omitted or significantly altered. The addition of explanatory notes and the removal of certain dialogue lines (e.g., the original “Elle oublie tout.” is kept but the subsequent elaboration is not faithful) result in a less complete representation of the source material. Moreover, the translation introduces new content that is not present in the French version, reducing fidelity.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the general sense and most technical details of the original French dialogue, but it suffers from several problems. The interleaved commentary and explanatory notes break the narrative flow, create redundancy, and occasionally alter the meaning. Terminology is largely accurate, though consistency could be improved. To enhance the translation, remove the meta‑commentary, streamline the dialogue, and ensure all original lines are represented without omission or unnecessary addition. This would improve readability, fluency, and overall fidelity to the source text."
