    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text contains fragmented sentences and abrupt shifts that can confuse readers. Some paragraphs are incomplete (e.g., “¿Veo.”, “Cuando abres una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío.”). The structure is logical in places, but the overall flow is interrupted, making it harder for a reader to follow the conversation and understand the concepts. Score: 12/20",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many phrases sound unnatural or are literal translations that do not fit Spanish idiomatic usage (e.g., “partes de un contexto vacío”, “da la impresión de que la IA recuerda los detalles de mi proyecto”). The text includes editorial comments (“¿Sería eso un truco?”) that break the narrative flow. There are also grammatical inconsistencies and missing accents. Overall, the translation reads more like a draft than a polished text. Score: 8/20",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly translated correctly (preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por contexto). However, the translation inconsistently mixes English acronyms (ICL) and Spanish terms, uses “apunte” for “anchor” which is not standard, and sometimes drops or mislabels terms (e.g., “anclaje” becomes “chivato”). Consistency is lacking, and some concepts are not fully explained for a non‑technical audience. Score: 12/20",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator did not fully adapt the cultural context. Phrases like “¿Sería eso un truco?” and the use of Spanish slang (“chivato”) feel out of place in a technical podcast transcript. The tone alternates between formal and informal, and some remarks that appear in the original (like the comparison with a bicycle) are missing or poorly rendered. The adaptation is therefore suboptimal. Score: 10/20",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several sections of the original dialogue are omitted or truncated (e.g., the explanation of “grounding”, the full analogy about learning for a test vs mastering a skill, the concluding remarks). Redundancies appear (repetition of “IA se olvidó”), and important nuances are lost. The translation is not fully faithful to the source. Score: 8/20",
      "score": 8
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation displays a basic grasp of the technical vocabulary but suffers from numerous structural, stylistic, and contextual issues. The readability is compromised by incomplete sentences and editorial intrusions, while the fluency is hampered by unnatural phrasing. Terminology is partially consistent but not uniformly applied. The cultural adaptation is weak, and key parts of the original content are missing or poorly rendered. Overall, this draft would need substantial revision to reach a publishable quality suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience of a technical podcast. A concise recommendation would be to rewrite the text with a clearer editorial line, standardize terminology, and ensure all original information is faithfully represented before finalizing it for broadcast or publication. Score: 10/20"
