    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and most technical concepts are conveyed clearly.  Some sentences are a bit long and could be split for better readability (e.g., the paragraph beginning with \"Esto es posible gracias a la expansión masiva…\" ).  Overall, readers can understand the content without much effort.  Score: 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation uses mostly natural Spanish, but several expressions feel awkward or non‑idiomatic.  \"Pre‑capacitación\" is uncommon and inconsistent with the later use of \"entrenamiento previo\".  Phrases like \"una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\" and \"la IA no se perfecciona constantemente a partir de tus conversaciones\" read a bit clunky.  With minor adjustments, the flow would be smoother.  Score: 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Terminology is mostly correct, but there is a noticeable inconsistency: \"optimización\" is used instead of \"ajuste fino\" (the conventional translation for fine‑tuning).  \"Pre‑capacitación\" deviates from the common \"preentrenamiento\"/\"entrenamiento previo\".  Consistent use of the same terms throughout would improve clarity.  Score: 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and style are preserved.  However, the closing episode title changes from \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Tech al Instante\", which might confuse listeners.  Cultural adaptation is otherwise adequate, but a few phrasing choices (e.g., \"una forma ingeniosa…\") could be refined for a more native feel.  Score: 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French is present.  No key points were omitted, and the explanation of ICL and fine‑tuning is retained.  Minor terminology inconsistencies do not materially alter meaning, and no unnecessary redundancy is added.  Score: 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the gist of the original script and is largely intelligible for a Spanish‑speaking audience.  However, it suffers from some inconsistent terminology, a few unnatural phrasings, and a slight mismatch in the closing episode title.  With targeted edits—standardizing key terms, smoothing awkward sentences, and aligning the episode name—the translation would reach a high level of quality and polish.  Overall, it is a solid but improvable rendition of the French source."
