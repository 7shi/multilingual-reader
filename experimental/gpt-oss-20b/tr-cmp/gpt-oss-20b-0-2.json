    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely comprehensible. Long sentences are kept intact, but the logical flow is preserved. Minor clarity issues arise with phrases such as “Usted lo ha entendido todo” and the untranslated term “ancrage”, which momentarily confuse the reader. Overall, listeners will understand the content but will notice a few awkward turns.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly smoothly for Spanish speakers. However, some expressions feel literal or formal out of place for a conversational podcast (e.g., “Usted lo ha entendido todo”, “El aprendizaje en contexto es bachotaje”). Minor grammatical oddities and occasional misuse of formal pronouns detract from naturalness. The vocabulary is appropriate, but overall naturalness is slightly reduced.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)* are correctly translated and retained. The term *grounding* was left as *ancrage*, a direct borrowing that could be better translated as *fundamentación* or *anclaje*. Despite that, the terminology is consistent and understandable for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent of the original podcast dialogue is preserved, and cultural references are adequately adapted (e.g., using familiar analogies). The shift to formal Spanish in some parts clashes with the informal, conversational tone of the original, slightly reducing contextual fit. Nonetheless, the core message and style are maintained.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script appear in the Spanish version. The explanation of pretraining, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning is intact. The added detail about the “Memory” feature is also present. No significant omissions, though a few small wording changes might clarify the meaning further.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers a solid, faithful rendering of the original French podcast. It retains the key concepts and narrative flow, with accurate technical terminology. Readability and information completeness are strong, but the naturalness of the language and some contextual adaptations (especially pronoun use and the untranslated term *ancrage*) reduce the overall fluency. Minor refinements would bring the translation up to a near‑native level of quality for Spanish‑speaking podcast listeners. Overall, it is a competent translation that effectively communicates the intended content with only modest room for improvement in style and cultural nuance."
