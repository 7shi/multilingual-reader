  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. Sentence structures are generally clear and the key concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory) are explained in a way that a native speaker can understand without difficulty. Minor repetitions and occasional overly literal phrasing slightly interrupt the flow, but overall the text remains comprehensible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds quite natural overall. However, there are a few spots where the phrasing feels a bit stiff or slightly off for a native speaker. Examples include \"en la universidad\" instead of the more common \"graduado de la universidad\" and the repetition of \"la IA la utiliza\". There are no major grammatical errors, but some expressions could be polished for smoother rhythm.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are translated accurately and consistently: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", \"memoria a corto plazo\". The Spanish equivalents are widely used in the AI community and are appropriate for a general audience. The term \"grounding\" is rendered as \"anclaje\", which is acceptable, though \"enraizamiento\" or \"aprímulo\" could also be used. Overall, terminology is well handled.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational tone of the original podcast is preserved. The translation keeps the informal dialogue style and uses everyday Spanish that fits a podcast audience. Cultural references are minimal, but the use of \"Tech Éclair\" as a brand name is retained, which is suitable. The adaptation could be slightly more idiomatic in places, but the intent and purpose are effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant information from the original is omitted. The translated script covers all segments, including the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the discussion on memory features. The text remains concise and avoids unnecessary repetition, maintaining clarity while preserving all essential content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and faithful to the original French text. It effectively conveys the technical concepts in clear Spanish, with consistent terminology and a conversational style appropriate for a podcast audience. Minor fluency tweaks would improve naturalness, but overall the translation is of high quality and easily understood by native Spanish speakers."
