  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally easy to read for a Spanish-speaking audience. The sentence structures are mostly logical and the speaker roles are clear. Minor issues arise from literal translations that slightly break flow (e.g., “Lo han entendido todo”), but overall the content is comprehensible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several phrases feel slightly off. For instance, “Lo han entendido todo” should be “Lo has entendido todo.” Also, the repetition of “es” and occasional awkward word order reduce smoothness. Vocabulary is largely appropriate, yet a few expressions could be refined for better native rhythm.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled very well: \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\" are all accurate and consistently used. Only the slight mis‑rendering of \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\" could be debated, but it remains clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and tone of the podcast are preserved. Cultural adaptation is mostly adequate; the translation does not introduce anachronisms or culturally inappropriate references. However, some idiomatic choices (e.g., \"Lo han entendido todo\") feel too literal. A more natural phrasing would strengthen this dimension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present. There is no significant omission of content. The only small gap is a lack of an explicit mention that the context window is part of the prompt, which is implied but not directly stated. Redundancy is minimal, and the translation remains concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful and understandable, with most terminology and concepts translated correctly. The main issues lie in minor grammatical slips and slightly awkward phrasing that could be smoothed out for a more native feel. With a few refinements, the text would read as naturally as a native‑written podcast script would in Spanish. Overall, the translation achieves a solid 18/20 score, reflecting good quality but with room for polishing the flow and precision of some expressions. The key strengths are accurate terminology, clear conveyance of intent, and completeness of information, while the main weaknesses are occasional literalness and small fluency problems that should be addressed in a final review."
