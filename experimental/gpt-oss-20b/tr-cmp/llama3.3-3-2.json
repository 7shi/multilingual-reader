  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation uses clear sentence structures and most technical concepts are explained in a way that a Spanish‑speaking audience can follow. Some sentences are a bit clunky (“...se ha reiniciado su espacio de trabajo temporal”) but overall the text is comprehensible. Minor omissions of connective words (e.g., missing article “los”) slightly reduce flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The language is largely natural and uses appropriate vocabulary. However, there are occasional awkward phrasings such as “se ha reiniciado su espacio de trabajo temporal” and missing accents (e.g., “tú” not “tu”). The dialogue feels conversational but some sentences feel forced, lowering the fluency slightly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are translated correctly and consistently: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, memoria, etc. The translator keeps the terms consistent with common Spanish parlance. No major terminology errors were found.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone of the podcast. Cultural references are appropriate for Spanish‑speaking listeners. A few idiomatic choices could be improved (e.g., “¡Una analogía perfecta!” is fine, but some phrases could be more colloquial), but overall the adaptation works well.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original text is preserved. No significant content is omitted. Minor wording changes do not affect meaning. The dialogue stays faithful to the source, and redundancy is minimal.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and largely faithful to the original French text. It retains the conversational tone and technical content while conveying the key ideas. Minor issues with flow, word choice, and small grammatical slips slightly lower the overall quality, but the translation remains clear, accurate, and suitable for the target audience. Improvements in phrasing and punctuation could elevate the fluency further, but the work is already at a professional level and effectively communicates the intended information to Spanish‑speaking listeners of the podcast. Overall, the translation demonstrates good control of language and technical terms, making it a solid, though not perfect, version of the original script. The translator has shown an understanding of both the source material and the target audience, resulting in a final product that is both accurate and engaging. Future revisions could focus on refining awkward phrasings and ensuring consistent use of accents and articles to push the quality from good to excellent. Overall score: 16.8/20, which indicates a strong translation that could be polished for maximum fluency and naturalness.\n\nOverall score (out of 20): 16.8"
