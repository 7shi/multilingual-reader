  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to read and the sentence structure is logical, but a few minor grammatical mistakes (e.g., “partes de un contexto vacío” should be “parte de un contexto vacío”) and the confusing insertion of an unrelated abbreviation make the text slightly harder to follow at those points.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation sounds natural for native speakers, but some phrases feel slightly awkward or literal (e.g., “aparecerá” could be replaced with “se mostrará”). Additionally, the erroneous “ICL (Lenguaje de Comprensión e Investigación)” disrupts the flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly rendered. The main issue is the incorrect expansion of ICL to \"Lenguaje de Comprensión e Investigación\", which misrepresents the abbreviation. Otherwise, terminology is consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and conveys the analogies effectively for Spanish-speaking audiences. Cultural references are appropriate. The mislabeling of ICL is the primary shortfall in contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French source is present; there are no omissions. The translator occasionally repeats certain explanations, but this does not compromise clarity. No unnecessary content was added.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely faithful and understandable, with accurate terminology and good adaptation to Spanish. The main flaw is the mistaken expansion of the abbreviation ICL, which introduces confusion. Minor grammatical errors also slightly detract from fluency. Overall, it is a solid translation that would serve most listeners well with a few corrections."
