  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The target text is highly fragmented, with many incomplete sentences and abrupt shifts. The overall flow is broken and the reader has to constantly re‑interpret what is being said. While some phrases are understandable, the lack of continuity and missing context make comprehension difficult for a native Spanish speaker. Hence the readability score is low.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation contains several unnatural constructions, leftover English words, and awkward phrasing (e.g., \"You can take\", \"Exactamente. No necesita aprender desde cero.\"). These elements interrupt the natural flow of the language, making the text sound stilted. The overall fluency is therefore quite poor.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *in‑context learning*, *ventana de contexto* are used correctly in places, but many essential terms are omitted or mistranslated. The terminology is inconsistent (e.g., sometimes keeping the English word “fine‑tuning”, sometimes using the Spanish “afinado”). This inconsistency reduces the effectiveness of the translation for a technical audience.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to keep the original conversational tone, but fails to adapt cultural references and idiomatic expressions. Phrases like \"contratar un experto brillante\" or “consultor temporal” are literal and do not match the French original’s nuance. Overall, the adaptation is weak.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are missing in the translation – many lines are truncated, and key explanations (e.g., the distinction between temporary memory and permanent knowledge) are omitted. The translation therefore fails to convey all the necessary information.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is incomplete, disjointed, and contains many errors that hinder comprehension and naturalness. It would need substantial revision to be usable for a Spanish‑speaking audience, especially those familiar with AI terminology. A complete rewrite that preserves the dialogue structure, ensures accurate terminology, and maintains readability is required before it could be considered acceptable. The overall quality is very low, reflecting significant issues across all evaluated criteria. The translation falls far short of the standard expected for professional or academic Spanish translation of a technical podcast script. A substantial amount of editorial work is necessary to correct inaccuracies, fill gaps, and improve flow and naturalness of the text. The result is currently unsuitable for publication or professional use without major revisions. The overall score is 5 out of 20, indicating very poor quality in its current form. This suggests that the translation needs a comprehensive rewrite to meet the original intent and clarity of the source material, with a focus on accurate terminology, coherent structure, and cultural adaptation to the target language audience. The present version is best suited as a rough draft or a starting point for further editing, rather than a finished product."
