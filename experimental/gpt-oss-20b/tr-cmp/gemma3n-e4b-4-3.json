    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally easy to read and the dialogue structure is clear. Complex ideas such as pre‑training and in‑context learning are expressed in a way that most Spanish‑speaking listeners can follow. Minor sentence fragments and the use of “ella” for the AI may slightly confuse some readers, but overall the text is comprehensible.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation flows smoothly and uses natural phrasing for the most part. A few expressions feel slightly literal or awkward (e.g., “ella lo olvida todo”, “la IA no tiene idea de lo que se dijo antes” could be more idiomatic). Vocabulary choice is appropriate and contemporary, but a few words like “ajuste fino” and “anclaje a datos” are correct yet could be more polished for native fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly translated correctly: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, and grounding. Consistency is good, though the term “ajuste fino” is used but later simplified to “ajuste”. The term “grounding” is rendered as “anclaje a datos”, which is understandable but not the most common translation. Overall terminology is appropriate for a general audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the intent of the original French dialogue and adapts it to a Spanish‑speaking context without altering meaning. Cultural references are minimal and no misinterpretation occurs. The speaker names and conversational style are preserved, making it suitable for the target audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, memory features, and the analogy of temporary vs. permanent knowledge. No significant content was omitted. Small details such as the ICL acronym are left out, but this does not affect overall understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is clear, faithful, and mostly natural. Minor stylistic tweaks would raise the quality, but the current version already serves its purpose for Spanish‑speaking listeners. It preserves the humor and explanatory tone of the original French podcast while conveying technical concepts in an accessible way. The overall quality is solid, making it a good example of professional translation with room for small refinements in fluency and terminology consistency."
