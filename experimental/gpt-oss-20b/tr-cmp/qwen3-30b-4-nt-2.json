  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version contains many duplicated lines, missing punctuation, and incomplete sentences (e.g., “Soy Luc…”, “Camille:” repeats, missing closing brackets). These errors break the flow, making it hard for a reader to follow the dialogue. Some sections are understandable, but the overall coherence suffers, especially for non‑native listeners who might get confused by the abrupt transitions.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text is full of awkward phrasing and grammatical inconsistencies (“El preentrenamiento”, “La Memoria”, “el ajuste fino busca crear una capacidad permanente”). The use of “Soy Luc” instead of “Yo soy Luc” is non‑idiomatic, and the repetition of speaker labels disrupts natural speech patterns. Vocabulary choices are generally correct but the syntax feels mechanical. The overall fluency is therefore low.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are largely preserved (preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, memoria). However, there is occasional mistranslation or omission (e.g., “grounding” simply rendered as “anclaje” without explanation). While terminology is recognizable, the lack of consistent explanations and some inaccuracies reduce the precision needed for a technical audience.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the conversational style of the original podcast but fails to adapt cultural references (e.g., “engagement de consultant” translated literally as “contratar a un consultor brillante”) and does not smooth idiomatic expressions for Spanish listeners. The intent is largely preserved, but the lack of local flavor and some literalism weakens contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is present, but there are notable omissions and repetitions that obscure the narrative flow. Key explanatory segments are sometimes truncated or duplicated, leading to confusion. The overall message is intact, but the redundancy and missing transitions compromise clarity.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation attempts to convey the technical concepts but suffers from significant structural errors, duplicated lines, and awkward phrasing. While terminology is mostly correct, readability and fluency are below expectations for a professional podcast transcript. A revision that cleans up the script, removes repetitions, and adjusts idiomatic expressions would greatly improve clarity and engagement for Spanish‑speaking listeners. The translation is usable but needs substantial editing to meet quality standards for a polished broadcast script. Overall, the work demonstrates a basic understanding of the source material but falls short in delivering a smooth, coherent, and culturally appropriate final product. The translation could be rated as average for content but weak in form, with room for improvement in accuracy and polish. The total composite score reflects these issues and is fairly low, indicating that the translation requires a serious rewrite to achieve professional quality for a Spanish audience. The translation could be better suited to a draft version rather than a finished product ready for broadcast. A more careful review and re‑editing would elevate the quality significantly, especially in terms of clarity, naturalness, and consistency across the dialogue.\n\nOverall score: 9/20 (average of individual criteria)."
