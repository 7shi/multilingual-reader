  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to read and the sentences flow logically. Most complex ideas are conveyed clearly, although occasional wordy phrasing (e.g., “la IA le da la información necesaria para la tarea a cumplir”) could be tightened. Overall, listeners can understand the content without major confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural to a native Spanish speaker. Minor awkwardness occurs where literal translation choices keep the English term “grounding” and some punctuation could be improved. Still, the grammar and syntax are sound and the tone fits a conversational podcast.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly translated: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto. The term “grounding” is left in English, which might surprise some readers; a Spanish equivalent would enhance consistency. Overall terminology use is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational style, adapting idiomatic expressions for Spanish listeners (e.g., “consultor brillante” for “consultant brilliant”). Cultural references are minimal, but the adapted language feels natural to a Spanish audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French source is present: pretraining, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, context‑window learning, grounding, memory features, and the final reflection on whether to use a temporary consultant or permanent expert. No key detail is omitted, and the translation remains concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers the core concepts with clarity and fidelity. Minor issues with terminology consistency and occasional literal phrasing slightly lower the fluency score, but the overall quality is strong and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience in a podcast context."
