  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is fragmented and mostly consists of placeholders such as \"Revised version\" and explanatory notes rather than coherent Spanish dialogue. Readers cannot follow the conversation, so readability is very poor. A score of 3 out of 20 reflects that only a few lines are somewhat understandable, but the overall structure is missing.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The language that does appear is often incomplete, with abrupt switches between French and Spanish, missing verbs, and unnatural phrasing (e.g., \"Revised version (natural, accurate, and culturally appropriate):\"). Consequently, the text does not sound natural to native Spanish speakers. A score of 2 captures the low fluency.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"contextual learning\" are occasionally present, but many are replaced by generic or placeholder phrases. Consistency is lacking and explanations are absent. Thus the terminology handling is weak, earning a 3/20.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to preserve the original intent and tone. Cultural references, humor, and the conversational rhythm of the podcast are largely lost. The adaptation is almost nonexistent, so the score is 2/20.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Much of the original dialogue is missing or reduced to notes. Key explanations (e.g., the difference between ICL and fine‑tuning) are either omitted or garbled. The content is far from complete, warranting a 2/20.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely incomplete and fragmented. It does not provide a coherent Spanish version of the original French podcast script. Key sections are missing or replaced by placeholders, making it unusable for readers. Improvements would require rewriting the entire script in natural, fluent Spanish while preserving the original meaning and tone, and ensuring all technical terms are correctly rendered and consistently used. The current version fails to meet basic translation standards for readability, fluency, terminology, contextual adaptation, or completeness. Overall, the quality is very low, and it would not serve as a satisfactory translation for Spanish-speaking audiences. The overall score reflects this assessment, resulting in a very low rating out of 20 points. The text needs substantial revision to become functional and professional."
