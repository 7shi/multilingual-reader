  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but several lines (e.g., \"And I am Luc\" remains in English) and grammatical slips (\"el IA\" instead of \"la IA\") can momentarily confuse readers. The overall structure is logical and follows the original dialogue, which helps comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most sentences read smoothly, there are a number of awkward or unnatural phrases such as \"Cuando abres una nueva pantalla\" and the mixed use of English terms in parentheses. These reduce the natural flow for native Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms like *pre‑entrenamiento*, *transfer learning*, *aprender en contexto* are correctly translated, but some (e.g., *fine‑tuning*, *ICL*, *grounding*) are left in English or inconsistently rendered. The terminology remains understandable but could be more consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the overall intent and tone of the original French podcast. Minor cultural mismatches (e.g., \"Hola y estáis invitados\" instead of a more formal greeting) exist but do not distort meaning. The adaptation is largely effective.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Essential information is preserved, yet a few omissions are notable: the line \"And I am Luc\" is untranslated, and some explanatory nuances around memory features are slightly flattened. No critical content is missing, but the completeness is not perfect.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation communicates the core concepts and follows the structure of the original French dialogue. However, the presence of untranslated English fragments, occasional grammatical errors, and slightly inconsistent terminology affect readability and fluency. With minor revisions—especially completing missing translations and smoothing phrasing—the text would achieve a higher quality level. The current work is solid but still falls short of a flawless, fully polished translation. The average score reflects these strengths and weaknesses, giving a final rating of 15/20, indicating a good but improvable translation effort. The score represents the mean of the five evaluated criteria, rounded to the nearest whole number. The translation demonstrates competence but would benefit from a final proofreading pass to eliminate residual errors and enhance naturalness."
