    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely readable, but some sentences feel slightly clunky (e.g., *\"se le ha dado un resumen justo antes de que comience a hablarle\"*).  The overall structure follows the original and complex ideas are mostly conveyed in a straightforward manner, though a few parts could be streamlined for better flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly natural to a Spanish speaker, yet there are moments where idiomatic expressions or word order feel off (e.g., *\"se le ha dado un resumen justo antes\"*).  Some phrase choices are literal and lack the smoothness found in native productions.  The vocabulary is appropriate, but occasional awkwardness lowers overall fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely kept intact: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*.  However, the abbreviation for In‑Context Learning is inconsistently rendered (*AEC* instead of *ICL*), and the brand name *Tech Éclair* is mistranslated as *Linterna Tecnológico* (should be *Linterna Tecnológica*).  Aside from these, the terminology is correct and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the cultural context is preserved and the translation respects the intended tone.  The main shortfall is the misnaming of the show, which can confuse listeners.  The rest of the adaptation—explanations of AI concepts, conversational style—fits a Spanish‑speaking audience well.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory mechanisms, and the final question about temporary vs. permanent expertise.  No significant omissions are detected, and the text remains concise without unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation delivers the essential content and conveys the original ideas with a fair level of fluency.  Nonetheless, some brand translation errors, inconsistent abbreviations, and a few awkward phrasing detract from the polish.  With minor adjustments—especially fixing the show title, aligning the abbreviation for ICL, and smoothing a few sentences—the translation could reach a higher standard of quality and readability for native Spanish audiences alike.  Overall, it is competent but leaves room for refinement in terminology consistency and cultural adaptation."
