    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely intelligible; the dialogue flows naturally and the concepts are explained clearly. However, a few sentences contain slightly clunky phrasing (e.g., *«se ha vaciado su almacenamiento temporal»*), which may momentarily disrupt the reader’s flow. Overall, the structure is logical and easy to follow.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Some expressions feel a bit literal or awkward (e.g., *«una forma astuta de aprendizaje en un contexto automatizado»*). Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, but a few word choices could be smoothed for a more idiomatic tone.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *afinación*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto* and *ICL* are used correctly and consistently. The translation of *grounding* as *vinculación* is acceptable, though *anclaje* would be closer to the original. Overall, terminology handling is strong and suitable for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely preserves the original intent, but there is inconsistency in the program name (*TecnoDestello* vs *Tech Éclair*). Some cultural adjustments could be made for smoother local resonance (e.g., choosing *anclaje* over *vinculación*). The adaptation is competent but not fully polished.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant information from the source is omitted. The dialogue covers all original points, and the added explanatory parenthetical notes help clarify terms. The text remains concise without unnecessary repetition, maintaining full informational integrity.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation demonstrates solid comprehension of the source material and a good grasp of technical language. Minor stylistic tweaks and consistency in naming would elevate the quality, but the piece is generally clear, fluent, and faithful to the original content. It is suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience familiar with AI terminology, with room for refinement in idiomatic expression and cultural adaptation."
