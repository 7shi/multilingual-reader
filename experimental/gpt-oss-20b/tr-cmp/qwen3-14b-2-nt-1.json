  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the clear, logical flow of the original. Sentences are long but understandable, and complex ideas are introduced in a step‑by‑step manner. The Spanish text is easy to follow for native readers, even those not familiar with AI concepts.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the prose sounds natural, but a few expressions feel slightly awkward or formal. For instance, \"El ajuste fino... ¿es ahí donde interviene el aprendizaje por transferencia?\" and \"Usted entiende todo\" are understandable but not the most idiomatic way a native speaker would phrase them. Vocabulary choices are mostly correct, though \"preentrenamiento\" and \"ajuste fino\" are fine, the repetition of \"en contexto\" in one sentence feels redundant.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL (aprendizaje en contexto), anclaje, memoria. There are no mistranslations or confusing synonyms, and the terms are suitable for an audience familiar with AI jargon.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the informal, conversational tone of the original podcast. Cultural references are appropriate; the use of \"usted\" in a few spots is acceptable in Spanish podcast scripts. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluidity, but the intent and humor are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No key information from the French source is omitted. All sections, explanations, analogies, and examples are present. The Spanish text is slightly longer in places, but this is due to the nature of Spanish phrasing, not redundancy or omission.",
      "score": 18
    },
