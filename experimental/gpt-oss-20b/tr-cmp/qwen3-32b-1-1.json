    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and easy to follow. The dialogue structure remains intact and the explanations of complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are understandable. Minor syntactic quirks (e.g., “Tome nota” vs. “Toma nota”) do not impede comprehension, so 18/20 is justified.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally for a native Spanish speaker overall. However, a few expressions feel slightly formal or awkward, such as the untranslated hashtag “#black boxes” and the mis‑translation of “tome nota” instead of “toma nota”. Additionally, the occasional misspelling “AIC” instead of “ICL” interrupts the flow. Therefore a score of 17/20 is appropriate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved (e.g., \"fine‑tuning\", \"In‑Context Learning\", \"grounding\"). The Spanish equivalents are mostly accurate and consistent. The sole error is the accidental use of “AIC” instead of “ICL”, which could confuse readers. The overall terminology handling merits 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the informal, conversational tone of the original and adapts cultural references suitably for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only drawback is the unexplained inclusion of the hashtag and the duplicate line about forgetting everything, which slightly detracts from a polished adaptation. Thus 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All main points from the French original are present in the Spanish version. No critical information is omitted. Minor duplication of the “forgetting” line and the “AIC” typo do not materially change meaning. The content remains concise and clear, justifying 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the Spanish translation is of high quality. It preserves the dialogue’s rhythm, explains technical concepts well, and conveys the original intent. Small issues such as a stray hashtag, an occasional typo, and a duplicated sentence slightly reduce the score, but the translation remains clear, fluent, and technically accurate for a native Spanish‑speaking audience."
