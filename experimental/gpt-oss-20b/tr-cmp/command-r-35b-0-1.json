  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly clear and logical. Sentences are well-structured and complex ideas are expressed in straightforward Spanish, making the content understandable to a general audience. Minor awkwardness in a few phrases slightly hampers fluency but does not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall, the text reads naturally for Spanish speakers. Some expressions such as \"El aprendizaje en contexto es como estudiar de memoria\" or \"La IA no se refina constantemente con tus conversaciones\" feel slightly clunky, yet they are not disruptive. The choice of vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\" (or \"refinamiento\"), \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\". Consistency could be improved by sticking to one word for \"fine‑tuning\" (preferably \"afinamiento\"), but overall the terminology is suitable for the target audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone while adapting idiomatic expressions to Spanish. Cultural references are minimal and remain appropriate. Minor adjustments could make some analogies even more natural, but the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant content is omitted. The translation conveys all key points from the original script, including the distinctions between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning. The explanation remains concise without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the original content while maintaining readability and fluency. Slight refinements in terminology consistency and phrasing would elevate it further, but it already serves the target audience well and preserves the original's conversational style and technical clarity. Overall, it earns an 18/20 score, indicating a very strong translation with room for minor polish.\n\nThe evaluation considers readability, fluency, terminology, contextual adaptation, and information completeness, each scored individually and summed to derive the overall rating. The reasoning highlights both strengths and minor areas for improvement, offering a balanced assessment of the translation's quality.\n\nScore: 18/20."
