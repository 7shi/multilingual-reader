  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to read and follows a logical sentence structure. The translation of complex concepts such as *pre‑entrenamiento* and *in‑context learning* is clear, and the dialogue format is preserved. Minor readability issues arise from slightly awkward phrasing in a few places (e.g., “el sistema busca rápidamente en tus antiguos intercambios”), but these do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural to a Spanish speaker, but there are several instances of literal wording that feel stiff (e.g., “el ajuste fino”, “el prompt”, repeated adverbs like “automáticamente”). Some verb choices (“lo olvida todo”) are informal but acceptable. Overall, the flow is smooth, but a few sentences could be polished for better idiomaticity.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, and *ventana de contexto* are accurately rendered. Consistency is maintained throughout, and explanatory phrases are provided where needed. Minor issues include the untranslated English word “prompt” and the use of “memoria a corto plazo” instead of the more common “memoria de contexto”, but these do not hinder understanding.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely preserves the original intent and tone. Cultural adaptation is minimal but adequate; the dialogue retains a conversational register suitable for a podcast audience. Some expressions could be more localized (e.g., “te olvida” vs. “se olvida”), yet the overall cultural relevance remains intact.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present, and the Spanish version does not omit any substantive information. Supplemental clarifications (e.g., explaining *grounding* and the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge) are included. The translation stays concise and avoids unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers a clear and largely natural Spanish rendering of the French original. It captures the technical details and maintains the dialogue’s engaging tone. Minor refinements in phrasing and the replacement of a few literal terms with more idiomatic Spanish would elevate the text to a higher level of fluency. Overall, the work is competent and effectively communicates the intended message to a Spanish‑speaking audience.  \n\n**Score (average of criteria)**: 16.4 / 20.0.  \n\n**Recommendation**: Review the dialogue for repetitive adverbs, adjust the use of the word \"prompt\" to a Spanish equivalent, and replace “en tus antiguos intercambios” with a smoother phrasing such as “en tus conversaciones anteriores”."
