  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is highly fragmented, with many sentences cut off or missing logical connectors. It is difficult for a reader to follow the dialogue, especially when the conversational flow is interrupted by stray brackets, incomplete clauses, and duplicated lines. While some parts are understandable, the overall readability is severely compromised.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains numerous unnatural expressions and grammatical errors (e.g., \"Aprendizaje previo\", \"Aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ancrage\" instead of \"anclaje\", incomplete verb forms). The style feels choppy and does not read like natural Spanish; many idiomatic constructions are missing or misapplied, making the translation sound mechanical.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are inconsistently handled. Some terms are correctly translated (e.g., \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\"), but others are mistranslated or left in French (\"ancrage\", \"grounding\"). There is a lack of consistent terminology and missing explanations for complex concepts, which reduces clarity for non‑expert readers.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to adapt to a Spanish‑speaking audience, yet it frequently uses literal French phrasing and ignores cultural context. It also mixes English terms without explanation, and some metaphorical references are lost or awkward. The overall intent of the original is somewhat preserved, but the adaptation quality is below expectation.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Significant portions of the original dialogue are omitted or truncated (e.g., missing lines, repeated brackets, incomplete explanations). The translation also introduces extraneous repetition and does not fully convey all conversational nuances, leading to loss of information. No additional clarifications or summaries were added to compensate.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation displays many structural, lexical, and contextual flaws that hinder comprehension and naturalness. It requires comprehensive revision to ensure accurate terminology, fluent Spanish, and complete conveyance of the original content. A more rigorous editing and localization process is needed before it can be considered usable for a native Spanish audience.\n\nOverall, the translation falls short of providing a clear, natural, and faithful rendition of the source text.\n\nScore: 6/20 (average of the five criteria)."
