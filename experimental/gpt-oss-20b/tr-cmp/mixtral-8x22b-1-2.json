  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable, but it contains several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing (e.g., missing accents, misplaced punctuation, and the repeated “Luc: Luc:”). These issues can confuse readers, especially when complex concepts are explained in a fragmented way. The sentence structure is sometimes broken, which reduces overall readability. A score of 12/20 reflects that the text is passable but still requires smoothing and proofreading.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation shows a number of unnatural expressions and syntax problems that disrupt the flow for a native speaker. For example, the line “Luc: Luc:” is a literal copy‑paste error, and the word “I” is incorrectly left in English where it should be “él”. Additionally, there are encoding errors (“discusiĆ³n”). While some phrases are idiomatic, many feel stilted, indicating that the overall fluency is below ideal. Score: 10/20.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved: “entrenamiento previo”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto” (ICL), and “ventana de contexto” are correctly translated. The Spanish equivalents are widely understood in the target audience, and there is consistency throughout. However, minor inaccuracies (e.g., “I” instead of “él”) and some missing terms (e.g., “grounding” is rendered as “ancrado” but not fully explained) slightly reduce precision. Score: 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to adapt cultural references (e.g., replacing “consultor brillante” with a Spanish equivalent) and keeps the conversational tone. Nonetheless, the repeated “Luc: Luc:” and the accidental inclusion of French fragments hinder the adaptation. The context is mostly maintained, but the translation could benefit from a smoother, more culturally resonant style. Score: 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original information is present, and the overall narrative is preserved. Some minor details, such as the explicit mention of “memory” features and the explanation of how they work, are adequately translated. However, a few lines are omitted or garbled (encoding errors), and the abrupt repetition of speaker tags reduces clarity. The content is largely complete, but slight omissions and redundancies exist. Score: 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main ideas but suffers from several technical errors, inconsistent speaker tags, and a few missing or garbled passages. It would benefit from a thorough copy‑editing pass to correct typos, remove duplicated lines, and ensure consistent terminology. With those fixes, the Spanish version would be clearer, more fluent, and more professional for the target audience. The current version is adequate for basic understanding but falls short of a polished final product. The average score is 12.6, rounded to 13 out of 20, reflecting a competent but imperfect translation that requires refinement before publication."
