  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable to a native speaker, but several errors (e.g., \"Exattamente\", misplaced French fragments, incomplete sentences) interrupt the flow and can confuse readers. Sentence structure is mostly logical, yet the occasional grammatical slip and untranslated bits reduce overall clarity.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains numerous unnatural expressions and grammatical mistakes. Words such as \"Exattamente\" or \"l'apprenti**s**sage\" are either misspelled or left in French. The use of English terms like \"fine‑tuning\" and the inconsistent handling of acronyms (ICL vs Aprendizaje en Contexto) further break the natural rhythm expected by Spanish listeners.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are present (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto), but their handling is inconsistent. Some are kept in English, others are translated incorrectly or partially. There is also a lack of clear explanations for terms that may be unfamiliar to a general audience. This inconsistency lowers the technical precision of the translation.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The core intent of the original dialogue is preserved, yet the translation fails to fully adapt certain cultural nuances (e.g., the informal, conversational tone of a podcast). The presence of untranslated French fragments and awkward phrasing indicates a missed opportunity for smoother, culturally appropriate Spanish expression.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translated dialogue covers the majority of the original content, but some passages are garbled or omitted (e.g., the French fragment \"Exattamente\" remains untranslated, and a few explanatory sentences are partially lost). These gaps slightly diminish the completeness, though redundancy is largely avoided.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is understandable but noticeably flawed. Frequent spelling and grammatical errors, inconsistent terminology, and untranslated fragments detract from the overall quality. While the main ideas are present, the Spanish version requires significant polishing to meet native‑speaker expectations and to faithfully convey the original French content in a natural, engaging podcast style. The translation could be improved by correcting errors, ensuring consistent terminology, and refining the conversational tone for Spanish listeners. Overall, the work falls short of a high‑quality professional translation, warranting a moderate score that reflects these issues yet acknowledges the retained core meaning and content coverage. 12/20 is an appropriate overall assessment for this version, reflecting its average strengths and weaknesses across the evaluated criteria."
