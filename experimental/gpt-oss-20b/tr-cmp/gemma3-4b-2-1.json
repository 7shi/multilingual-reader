  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is riddled with broken sentences, missing punctuation, and repeated symbols (e.g., \"}{{{}}\"). These issues make it difficult for a native reader to follow the logical flow, especially in long paragraphs. While the basic idea of the conversation is traceable, the clarity is severely compromised. The target audience would struggle to understand the content without significant effort to reconstruct the meaning.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural expressions and awkward grammar. Phrases like \"en vez de enviarlo seguir un programa de formación\" are ungrammatical, and the use of quotation marks and braces is inconsistent. Vocabulary choices are generally correct, but the overall sentence rhythm feels disjointed. A native speaker would find the text choppy and hard to read.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana contextual\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly translated in many places. However, inconsistencies appear: \"ICL\" is left untranslated, \"grounding\" is rendered as \"anclaje\" but not consistently, and several key phrases (e.g., \"memory\", \"contextual learning\") are omitted or garbled. Moreover, the repeated characters interfere with the clarity of terminology usage.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to adapt some expressions to Spanish, but cultural and contextual nuances are lost or distorted. For instance, the metaphor of a consultant is translated but then broken by incorrect phrasing. Additionally, some references to the French original (e.g., “Tech Éclair”) are omitted, weakening the context for Spanish listeners. The overall intent of explaining AI learning methods is preserved but with many errors that diminish cultural appropriateness.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several parts of the original conversation are missing or truncated in the translation, notably the segment about the new \"Memory\" feature and the detailed example of how the AI handles past context. Repeated braces and cut‑off sentences result in omitted explanations that are essential for comprehension. Consequently, important information is lost, and the content lacks completeness.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is severely flawed. It suffers from garbled formatting, broken syntax, and incomplete content, making it difficult for a Spanish‑speaking audience to understand the original message. A thorough rewrite is needed to restore clarity, coherence, and completeness while preserving the technical accuracy of the French source material. The current version does not meet the standards expected for a professional translation and requires substantial revision before it can be used effectively in a podcast context. The overall quality is very low, and it falls short of the requirements for readability, fluency, and completeness. The translation should be considered unusable in its current form and must be redone with careful attention to grammar, formatting, terminology, and contextual adaptation. The score reflects this poor quality and the need for a complete overhaul of the text."
