  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely easy to read and follows a logical sentence structure that mirrors the original French script. The dialogue format is preserved, and key ideas are conveyed clearly. Minor issues arise in a few sentences where the phrasing feels slightly stiff or repetitive (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto es estudiar de memoria”), but overall the content is comprehensible to a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation displays good fluency with most expressions sounding natural to Spanish listeners. However, there are occasional awkward constructions and inconsistent hyphenation (e.g., “preentrenamiento” vs. “pre‑entrenamiento”). Some punctuation and accent marks are missing or misplaced, slightly disrupting the flow. The overall style remains appropriate for a podcast transcript.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, and *ventana de contexto* are correctly rendered. The term *grounding* is introduced as “anclaje” with a brief note, but the explanation could be more explicit. Consistency is maintained across the script, and the terminology is suitable for a general audience with some technical background.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural adaptation is adequate; the hosts’ names and the casual banter feel natural in Spanish. Minor improvements could be made, such as choosing plural greetings (“Hola y bienvenidos a”) to match the podcast audience, but overall the contextual meaning is well conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the script includes necessary clarifications (e.g., explaining *learning by transfer*). Redundancy is minimal and the translation remains concise while providing sufficient context for listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material and delivers a clear, understandable Spanish rendition. Minor stylistic and typographic issues are present, but they do not significantly impede comprehension. With slight refinements to phrasing and punctuation, the text could reach an excellent level of quality for native Spanish listeners in a podcast setting."
