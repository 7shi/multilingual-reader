  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version conveys the dialogue clearly for a general audience, but some sentences are long and occasionally awkwardly phrased (e.g., \"El aprendizaje por transferencia es clave.\" \"Mire\"), which may hinder smooth reading. The overall structure is logical, yet a few grammatical inconsistencies (such as missing accents or mismatched verb tenses) slightly reduce clarity.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly natural overall, but there are several instances of awkward phrasing and non‑standard word choices: \"Mire\" is formal and a bit out of place, \"aprendizaje contextual\" instead of the more common \"aprendizaje en contexto\". Some verbs are incorrectly conjugated or capitalized (e.g., \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\" with an unnecessary capital C). These issues slightly detract from the natural flow for native speakers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\" (used as \"afinamiento\"), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL), and \"anclaje\". The term \"memoria\" for the new feature is appropriate. Minor inconsistencies exist, such as the plural form of \"preentrenamiento\" and occasional missing accents, but overall terminology remains clear and consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Cultural adaptation is generally good, but there are noticeable errors: the program’s name is changed from \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Tech Luz\" in the closing, and the final line uses \"Tech Luz\" instead of the original name. Also, the phrase \"para el próximo episodio\" should be used instead of the current phrasing. These inconsistencies reduce the sense that the translation fully respects the source context.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish transcript includes all dialogue lines and key concepts from the original. No major content is omitted, and explanations are preserved. The only minor omission is the explicit mention of the “program of training for several years” that appears in the French version. Overall, the information remains complete and coherent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is generally understandable and retains the main ideas of the original, but it suffers from several fluency issues, minor terminology inconsistencies, and a key contextual mistake in the program’s name. With some polishing—especially correcting the name, tightening sentence structures, and standardizing terminology—the translation would reach a higher quality level suitable for a native Spanish‑speaking audience in a technical context. Overall, it is a solid effort but requires refinement to achieve professional standards.\n\nScore: 81/100 (sum of the five criteria)."
