    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is mostly clear and logically organized. Sentences flow well and the overall narrative is easy to follow, though a couple of lines are slightly confusing because of a misplaced question. Overall, readers can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in Spanish, with appropriate vocabulary and modern phrasing. Minor awkwardities appear in a few sentences (e.g., “¿Qué quiere decir?” which is not present in the original and feels out of place). These do not severely hinder comprehension, but they lower the fluency score slightly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly rendered and consistently used. The term \"anclaje\" is also accurate. There is one small confusion with an extraneous question, but terminology overall is spot‑on.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator keeps the informal, conversational tone appropriate for a podcast. Cultural references are handled correctly and no content is lost or misinterpreted beyond the minor line issue. Adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all of the original content is present. The main omission is the misplaced question “¿Qué quiere decir?” that replaces a line that was not in the original, slightly altering the flow. No major information is lost, but this small omission affects completeness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully conveys the meaning and tone of the original French dialogue, using clear language and accurate technical terminology. Minor issues—particularly an out‑of‑place question and a slight change in phrasing—affect fluency and completeness slightly. Overall, it is a strong translation suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners, with just a few areas for refinement to reach perfection. 18/20 points overall. 18/20"
