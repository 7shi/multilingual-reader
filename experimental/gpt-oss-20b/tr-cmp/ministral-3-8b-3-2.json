    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, but the inclusion of many editorial comments (e.g., “Improved Translation:”, “Alternative (more concise):”) interrupts the flow and makes the dialogue hard to follow. Readers must parse the actual text from the meta‑notations, which lowers clarity. Basic sentence structure is generally correct, yet the extra comments add unnecessary clutter. 10/20.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the sentences read naturally, but several awkward choices appear: e.g., “preentrenamiento” vs “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino” used consistently but “ajuste fino” can feel stilted, and “en el contexto” is slightly informal. The inserted meta‑comments break the rhythm of the conversation and feel out of place for a finished translation. 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms are correctly rendered (“pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “anclaje”) and generally consistent. However, the translation mixes “preentrenamiento” and “pre‑entrenamiento” and occasionally uses English loan‑words (“ICL”) without Spanish equivalents. Overall, terminology is appropriate but could be more uniform. 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation stays close to the original intent but introduces some additional explanations that are not in the source (e.g., “No parte de cero; se basa en una base extremadamente sólida”). While this can help a lay audience, it also slightly deviates from the original conversational tone. Cultural references are generally adapted (e.g., “consultor” for “consultant”), yet the meta‑notes disrupt the narrative. 11/20.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points of the original dialogue are present; there are no substantive omissions. The added explanatory comments provide extra context but are not strictly necessary. The redundancy introduced by the meta‑notations is removed in the final version, so overall conciseness is acceptable. 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers a generally faithful rendering of the French dialogue into Spanish and handles the technical vocabulary well. However, the presence of editorial annotations (“Improved Translation:”, “Alternative (more concise):”) disrupts readability and fluency, making the text feel like a draft rather than a finished translation. The flow of the conversation is compromised, and some minor inconsistencies in terminology exist. With further cleanup and removal of the meta‑information, the translation could be polished into a high‑quality, professional piece. The overall quality is moderate, reflecting a solid base that requires refinement to meet native‑speaker expectations fully. 13/20."
