  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to read and the narrative flows logically. Sentences are largely clear and follow the original structure. Minor issues such as a few long, compound sentences could be split for even greater clarity, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for native Spanish speakers in most places. Some literalisms appear (e.g., *“preentrenamiento”* and *“afinamiento”* instead of the more common *“ajuste fino”*), but they do not impede understanding. Overall, the flow is smooth with only a handful of slightly awkward phrasings.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved and understood: *in‑context learning* → *aprendizaje en contexto*, *fine‑tuning* → *afinamiento*. However, consistency could be improved by using *ajuste fino* for *fine‑tuning* and by adding brief explanations where necessary. Terminology aligns with the audience’s level of knowledge.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the cultural context of Spanish‑speaking audiences, maintaining the podcast style and idiomatic expressions where appropriate. The phrase *“consultor brillante”* works well, and references to “Tech Éclair” are kept intact. Cultural adaptation is adequate, though some subtle local slang could further localize the text.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French transcript is present in the Spanish version. There are no omissions of facts or concepts, and the narrative remains concise. Minor redundancies are kept to preserve the conversational rhythm of the podcast.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation accurately conveys the content, tone, and intent of the original French text. Minor refinements in terminology and flow could elevate the quality to a perfect score, but the current version is clear, natural, and comprehensive."
