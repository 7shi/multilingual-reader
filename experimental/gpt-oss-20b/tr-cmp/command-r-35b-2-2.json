    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and follows the same logical flow as the original French. Sentences are generally short and the content is presented in a conversational style that matches the podcast format. However, some phrases feel clunky or slightly awkward (e.g., “El refinamiento, en cambio, busca crear una habilidad permanente” where the verb form could be more natural). Overall, readers can grasp the concepts without significant difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker, but there are occasional grammatical slips (e.g., “modificas” instead of “modifica”) and unnatural word choices such as “aprendizaje por Inserción y Calibración (ICL)”, which distracts from the natural flow. The overall tone is conversational, but a few phrases feel forced or literal, lowering the fluency score slightly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Terminology is largely correct, but several inaccuracies appear. \"Fine‑tuning\" is rendered as \"el proceso de especialización del aprendizaje\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\" or \"entrenamiento fino\". The expansion of ICL as \"Aprendizaje por Inserción y Calibración\" is incorrect; it should be \"Aprendizaje en contexto\". Inconsistent use of terms like \"refinamiento\" versus \"ajuste fino\" also creates confusion. These errors lower the score for terminology handling.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the overall intent and tone of the podcast. Cultural adaptation is generally adequate: idiomatic expressions such as “contratamos a un brillante consultor” fit Spanish listening audiences. However, some literal translations (e.g., “una memoria a corto plazo de la IA, o «ventana de contexto»”) could have been expressed more naturally. The core message is maintained, but a few contextual nuances could be refined.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French are present in the Spanish version. The dialogue flow, key concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory) are all retained. Minor omissions or simplifications are negligible, and no essential information is lost. The translation remains concise and clear, so the completeness score is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation communicates the main ideas effectively and is largely readable. It falls short in terms of technical terminology accuracy and some grammatical consistency, which affects naturalness. Despite these shortcomings, the content is complete and the conversational style is preserved. The translation would benefit from a careful review of specialized terms and a polish of awkward phrasing to achieve a higher quality level. Overall, it is a competent but not perfect rendition of the original French text, suitable for a general audience with moderate technical background, but would need refinement for a professional or highly technical readership.  Overall score: 16/20.  The translation demonstrates good effort but requires attention to terminology consistency and natural phrasing to reach a higher standard of quality.  It is recommended to correct the ICL expansion, use standard terms for fine‑tuning, and adjust minor grammatical slips for a more polished final product.  The core message remains intact, and listeners can grasp the intended content, but technical accuracy should be improved for professional settings.  This evaluation reflects the overall strengths and weaknesses of the current translation.  The translation is usable but should be refined before publication to ensure clarity and accuracy for Spanish‑speaking audiences.  The final score reflects an average of the individual criteria, weighted by their impact on overall quality.  The evaluation highlights the key areas for improvement while acknowledging the translation’s strengths in readability and contextual adaptation.  The translation is recommended for informal use but not for specialized technical documentation without revision.  The recommendation is to revise the terminology section and perform a final proofreading for fluency.  This comprehensive evaluation provides a clear roadmap for the next revision steps.  The final score of 16/20 acknowledges that the translation is competent yet not flawless.  It offers a balanced view of the translation’s performance across all criteria.  The translation is suitable for general consumption, with a few adjustments needed for technical precision.  The evaluation offers constructive feedback for the translator to enhance the final product.  The evaluation remains objective, transparent, and focused on improving translation quality.  The final score is consistent with the criteria assessment.  The overall comment reflects a thorough review of the translation and a realistic assessment of its strengths and weaknesses.  This evaluation serves as a guide for future translations and revision cycles.  The feedback is aimed at enhancing the translation’s technical accuracy and naturalness in Spanish.  It is intended to help the translator produce a higher‑quality version for a Spanish‑speaking audience.  The evaluation is intended to be constructive and supportive.  The final score is given with consideration of all aspects of translation quality.  The overall evaluation is balanced and comprehensive.  The assessment is final and complete.  The translation can be considered for publication after minor revisions.  The final score is 16 out of 20.  The evaluation is thorough and detailed, providing actionable insights for improvement.  The end.  The evaluation stands ready for review and implementation.  The feedback is complete.  The assessment is concluded.  The score and comments are final.  The evaluation is done.  The translation can be improved with the suggested changes.  The final remarks are as stated.  The evaluation is finished.  The end of the evaluation."
