    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is overall clear and follows a logical flow that Spanish readers can follow. The dialogues are easy to understand and the concepts are largely explained in a way that matches the original. Minor syntactic oddities (e.g., “afino” instead of “ajuste fino”) slightly interrupt the reading but do not prevent comprehension. Overall readability is high. Score: 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds generally natural, but several phrases feel awkward or non‑idiomatic: the use of “afino”, the phrase “apri” for fine‑tuning, the mix of “in‑context learning” with the incorrect abbreviation ACL, and occasional literal translations like “enraizamiento” instead of “anclaje”. These quirks reduce the smoothness for a native speaker, but the majority of sentences flow well. Score: 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly correctly rendered (“pre-entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “memoria a corto plazo”, “ventana de contexto”), but there are notable errors: ‘afino’ is not standard Spanish for fine‑tuning, ‘ACL’ mistakenly replaces the correct ICL abbreviation, and ‘enraizamiento’ is an uncommon translation of grounding. Consistency is generally good except for these points. Score: 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and conversational style. Cultural adaptation is adequate; the Spanish speakers will recognize the concepts. Minor issues (e.g., incorrect abbreviation) slightly weaken the adaptation but do not change the overall purpose. Score: 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, context window, ICL, grounding, memory mechanisms. No essential information is omitted, and the content remains concise. The only subtle omission is the precise abbreviation for ICL, but the meaning is still clear. Score: 19/20.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and understandable, but it contains several technical inaccuracies and awkward phrasing that affect fluency and terminology precision. A careful review focusing on correct Spanish terminology for AI concepts (fine‑tuning, ICL) and consistent use of idiomatic expressions would bring the quality up to a professional standard."
