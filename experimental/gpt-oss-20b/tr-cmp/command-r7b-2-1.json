    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is understandable for a general audience, but the repetition of entire paragraphs, abrupt sentence breaks, and occasional missing articles (e.g., *El preentrenamiento es un proceso...* instead of *El preentrenamiento* or *El preentrenamiento consiste...*) make the flow feel choppy. Long clauses that were clear in French are sometimes broken into fragmented statements, which can hinder smooth comprehension. Overall, the readers can follow the main ideas but would benefit from smoother paragraph structuring.",

    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural constructions: *El preentrenamiento es un proceso crucial en el aprendizaje de los modelos de IA. A menudo, estos modelos se perciben...* repeats the same idea awkwardly, and verbs are sometimes misplaced (e.g., *le preentrenamiento* instead of *el preentrenamiento*). There are also literal repetitions of French phrasing, such as *La diferencia entre bachoter para un examen* (a literal adaptation that feels clunky). Vocabulary is mostly correct, but the overall rhythm suffers from these mechanical inserts and occasional grammatical slips, reducing the naturalness of the text.",

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly kept (preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL). However, some terms are translated inconsistently: *ajuste fino* is used as *afinamiento*, *fine-tuning* appears as *afino* in one spot, and *grounding* is left untranslated as *ancrage*. Also, *ICl* is not explained or adapted. The terminology is understandable, but the translation would benefit from consistent use of the most common Spanish equivalents (ajuste fino, aprendizaje en contexto, etc.).",

      "reasoning": "The original French text is conversational, with a friendly host and a colleague. The Spanish version attempts a similar style but sometimes misplaces the conversational flow (e.g., the Spanish narrator says *¡Hola y bienvenidos a ",

    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text repeats entire sections verbatim from the French source, leading to redundancy, and in some places omits nuance or slightly changes wording (e.g., *Le preentrenamiento* vs *El preentrenamiento*). While the main ideas are retained, certain subtle emphases and the back‑and‑forth dialogue structure are lost in translation, and the final conclusion does not exactly mirror the original sign‑off. The content is therefore somewhat complete but not fully faithful or concise.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers the essential storyline but suffers from excessive repetition, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent terminology. A smoother, more natural Spanish rendering with careful handling of technical terms and a tighter dialogue structure would improve readability and fluency significantly. The current version is functional but feels more like a literal word‑for‑word conversion rather than a polished, culturally adapted script for Spanish‑speaking listeners. If the goal is a professional podcast script, substantial editing is recommended to achieve a fluent and engaging final product. The score reflects these shortcomings while acknowledging that the core information is largely preserved.\n\nScore: 59/100 (approx. 12/20 + 10/20 + 14/20 + 10/20 + 12/20)."
