    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely understandable, but occasional stray French words (e.g., “Exactement”, “Precisely”) interrupt the flow. Sentence structure is generally logical, though a few paragraphs feel slightly choppy due to missing punctuation or awkward clause ordering. Overall, readers can follow the content, but a few corrections would improve clarity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly in most parts, but there are notable instances of unnatural phrasing and untranslated fragments (e.g., “Exactement”, “Precisely”). Some sentences have misplaced commas or lack accents, which detract from native‑speaker naturalness. Vocabulary choices are generally appropriate, but a more consistent use of Spanish idiomatic expressions would enhance fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto” are correctly translated and consistent. Minor issues: “afinamiento” could be replaced with “ajuste fino” for precision, but overall terminology is accurate and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent is conveyed, but the translation lacks subtle cultural adaptation in some idiomatic expressions. The use of “consultor brillante” is good, yet some literal renderings (“sistema más inteligente”) could be smoothed. The text remains faithful to the source, though a more localized tone would strengthen it.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory features, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. No substantive information is omitted, and redundancy is minimal. A few explanatory clarifications could be added, but overall completeness is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the essential ideas and technical details of the original French script. However, residual French fragments, occasional unnatural phrasing, and minor punctuation issues affect readability and fluency. With a few edits—removing untranslated words, smoothing idiomatic expressions, and tightening sentence flow—the translation would be of high quality for a native Spanish-speaking audience."
