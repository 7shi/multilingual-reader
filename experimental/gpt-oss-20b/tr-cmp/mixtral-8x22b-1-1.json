    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable; sentence structures are simple and logical. However, a few glitches – such as duplicated lines, missing punctuation, and garbled characters like \"discusiĆ³n\" – interrupt the flow and can confuse readers. The overall message is clear enough for a general audience, but these issues lower the readability slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation displays a mix of natural phrasing and literalness. Common expressions and idioms are used correctly, but some parts read awkwardly – for instance, the duplicated \"Luc: Luc: Exacto.\" and the phrase \"El aprendizaje en contexto es estudiar desesperadamente para un examen.\" which feels forced. Additionally, the name of the podcast is inconsistently rendered. These quirks reduce the overall fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"memoria a corto plazo\", \"ICL\" are all correct and consistent. The explanation of transfer learning and in‑context learning is clear. Minor issues include occasional untranslated acronyms and a lack of clarification for some terms, but overall the terminology is appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking tech audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator keeps the core intent and tone of the original French script, adapting cultural references where necessary. However, the change from \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Tecno Relámpago\" is unnecessary and inconsistent, and the final line reverts to the original name, creating confusion. Some expressions could have been further localized, but the gist is preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French source is present. No major omissions or additions. The script stays concise and the content remains clear, with only minor redundancies due to the literal translation of some phrases.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is a solid, mostly faithful rendition that conveys the technical concepts and conversational style of the original. Minor issues—duplicate lines, encoding errors, inconsistent podcast name, and some awkward phrasing—slightly diminish readability and fluency. With a few polishing touches, the Spanish version would be ready for a native audience while preserving the original’s clarity and intent. Overall, a competent translation with room for refinement in style and consistency, earning a 17/20 overall score for completeness and fidelity but less for fluency and contextual adaptation. The key strengths are accurate terminology and a clear conveyance of the core ideas; the main weaknesses lie in the naturalness of the language and a few technical glitches that should be corrected before publication."
