  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the ideas are presented in a logical order. However, occasional literal phrasings make some sentences feel slightly mechanical. Overall, the target readers can understand the content without much difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly reads naturally, but there are a few grammatical errors and awkward word choices that stand out – e.g., \"Entienden todo\" instead of \"Lo entiendes todo\" and the abrupt use of \"Entienden todo\" in one place. Additionally, the phrase \"Entienden todo.\" in the middle of a dialogue breaks the flow. These issues lower the fluency slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently and appropriately. \"Preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje transferido\", \"ventana de contexto\", and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are all correct and familiar to Spanish‑speaking audiences. The translation does not miss any key terms and maintains consistency throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator has kept the style formal and conversational, matching the original podcast tone. While the content is largely literal, it still respects the cultural expectations of Spanish speakers – no major misinterpretations or culturally inappropriate expressions were found. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve the adaptation, but the intent is preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is present. No substantial omissions were identified, and the text does not add extraneous content that would dilute the meaning. The translation is concise and keeps the same level of detail as the source.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely accurate and preserves the meaning and intent of the original French text. Minor grammatical errors and some slightly unnatural phrasings reduce overall fluency, but readability and terminology are strong. A brief proof‑read would address the main issues and elevate the translation to near‑perfect quality."
