  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable to native speakers and follows the conversational style of the original. However, a few sentences are slightly awkward or over‑simplified, which slightly hinders the flow. Nonetheless, the core ideas remain clear and the structure is logical.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in many places, but there are noticeable grammatical slips (e.g., “busca rápida” instead of “busca rápidamente”) and some unnatural word choices (“segundo plano” to describe background insertion). These issues reduce overall smoothness but do not render the text incomprehensible.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and appropriately translated (e.g., pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje en contexto). Terminology is consistent throughout, though the use of “ajuste fino” instead of “fine‑tuning” is acceptable. Minor inconsistencies such as “Memoria” vs “memoria” are present but do not materially affect understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the intent and tone of the original but makes an error in the show’s name, changing it from \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Flash Tech,\" which is a significant contextual mismatch. Cultural references are generally fine, but the title change reduces accuracy in contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points of the original are present, including pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and the concept of memory features. Some minor paraphrasing occurs, but no critical information is omitted. The overall content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and mostly faithful to the source text, with clear conveyance of technical concepts and overall intent. Minor issues—particularly the incorrect show title, a few grammatical errors, and slightly awkward phrasing—diminish the polish. For a professional context, these would need refinement, but for general audience consumption the translation serves its purpose well."
