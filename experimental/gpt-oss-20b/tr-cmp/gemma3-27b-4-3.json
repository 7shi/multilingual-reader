    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely comprehensible; the conversational tone is preserved and the sequence of ideas follows the original fairly closely. However, some repetitions (“Pre‑capacitación” vs. “entrenamiento previo”) and slightly awkward phrasing (e.g., “partes de un contexto vacío”) reduce clarity in a few spots.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text is mostly smooth for native Spanish speakers, but a handful of unnatural expressions appear: “Pre‑capacitación”, “la optimización” for fine‑tuning, and a few minor grammatical slips (e.g., “partes de un contexto vacío”). These detract from the overall naturalness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled inconsistently. While “aprendizaje por transferencia” and “aprendizaje en contexto” are correct, the translation of fine‑tuning as “la optimización” is misleading, and “Pre‑capacitación” is not a standard term. Some concepts are explained, but consistency is lacking.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue keeps the original intent and tone, and it is culturally appropriate for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The show’s title is retained, which is fine. Minor stylistic issues (capitalization of “Pre‑capacitación”) slightly weaken adaptation but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French version are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. No critical information is omitted, and redundancies are minimal.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation communicates the key ideas of the original French script and maintains the conversational style. However, there are noticeable inconsistencies in terminology and some unnatural phrasing that affect readability and fluency. Improving the accuracy of technical terms and smoothing out awkward sentences would raise the overall quality significantly. Overall, it is a solid, understandable translation with room for refinement in consistency and naturalness, scoring around 16/20 overall. If the target audience is general Spanish speakers, the translation is serviceable but would benefit from a final proof‑read focusing on terminology and idiomatic expressions. The translator should replace “la optimización” with “ajuste fino” or “afinamiento” and eliminate the inconsistent use of “Pre‑capacitación.”"
