  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many sentences that are understandable but also many that are confusing or incomplete. The overall structure follows the original, but some paragraphs are missing context or have abrupt wording. The inserted English fragment \"Here are some improved translations based on different contexts\" breaks the flow. Readers can grasp the main ideas, but the lack of clarity in a few sections reduces overall readability.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version exhibits several awkward phrases, mixed languages (French fragments such as \"Ce serait incroyablement inefficace\"), and non‑natural word choices (e.g., \"conexión\" instead of \"anclaje\"). Some sentences are grammatically correct but sound stilted. Overall, the text does not read as a polished, native‑speaker style, which lowers the fluency score.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms like \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", and \"ventana de contexto\" are correctly rendered. However, \"grounding\" is mistranslated as \"conexión\", and \"fine‑tuning\" is alternated between \"perfeccionamiento\" and \"ajuste fino\" without consistency. Some technical explanations are omitted or misrepresented. Consequently, terminology handling is partially correct but not consistently accurate.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely follows the original French intent but lacks cultural and linguistic adaptation in a few places. The French idiom \"c’est la manière idéale de poser le problème\" is translated as \"es la manera ideal de plantear el problema\", which is acceptable but not as polished. The use of French phrases intermingled with Spanish diminishes contextual adaptation. Overall, the cultural nuance is mostly preserved but with noticeable shortcomings.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the content is present, but the inclusion of an unrelated English fragment and the omission of certain explanatory sentences from the original lead to information gaps. Some details about the memory feature are less clear due to mixed language and translation choices. Therefore, the translation is incomplete in a few respects, but it does not miss major plot points.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation attempts to convey the original script but suffers from several significant issues: inserted non‑Spanish text, inconsistent terminology, awkward phrasing, and occasional French remnants. While the main ideas are understandable, the quality is below a professional standard and would require revision for clarity, naturalness, and technical accuracy. The translation is usable for a general audience with some effort but not suitable for a polished, expert‑level release without substantial edits."
