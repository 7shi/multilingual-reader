  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable for a general audience, with clear sentence structures and logical flow. Some explanations of technical concepts are slightly more literal than necessary, but overall the content is comprehensible. Minor issues such as the fragment “Por lo tanto” without a following clause do not significantly impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation exhibits several awkward phrasings that break naturalness, e.g. “Lo han entendido todo” instead of “Lo has entendido”, and the repeated use of “Excelente observación” feels stilted. The verb conjugations and pronoun usage sometimes mismatch the subject, which could confuse native listeners. Overall, it reads as a direct literal translation rather than polished prose.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje en contexto* and *grounding* (translated as *anclaje*) are appropriately rendered and consistent throughout. The use of *Memoria* for the feature is correct. The translator maintains terminology clarity suitable for a non‑specialist audience, with minimal unnecessary jargon.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, but some expressions are carried over too literally. For instance, “El aprendizaje en contexto es estudiar de memoria” is a direct translation that might be expressed more naturally in Spanish. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is adequate but could benefit from a more natural register.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present in the Spanish version; no major omissions are detected. The translator kept the dialogue structure and the nuanced distinctions between fine‑tuning and in‑context learning. Minor redundancies were not added, keeping the text concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original meaning fairly well and maintains technical accuracy, but it lacks natural fluency in several places. With some polishing—especially in verb conjugations, pronoun usage, and idiomatic expressions—the Spanish version would read more smoothly for native listeners. The overall quality is competent but leaves room for improvement in naturalness and stylistic flow."
