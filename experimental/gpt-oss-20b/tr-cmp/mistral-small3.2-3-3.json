  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable to native readers, with clear sentence structure and logical flow. Some minor syntactic oddities (e.g., \"Todo el historial de su discusión en esta sesión…\" instead of \"conversación\") slightly disrupt readability, but overall comprehension is maintained.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural and convey the intended meaning. However, a few literal translations create awkward phrasing, such as \"lo han entendido todo\" and the abrupt switch to English acronyms without proper introduction. These moments lower fluency, though they do not hinder overall readability.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, grounding. Consistency is maintained throughout, and explanations accompany terms where needed. Only minor stylistic refinements could improve precision.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the original tone and intent. The name change from \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Tecno Revelación\" (and back again at the end) introduces a slight inconsistency that may confuse listeners. Cultural references are appropriately handled, but some idiomatic expressions could be better localized.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present, and no significant details are omitted. The translation keeps the narrative structure intact and avoids unnecessary repetition, ensuring concise yet comprehensive coverage.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation demonstrates solid comprehension of the source material and conveys the technical concepts clearly. Minor fluency issues and a slight inconsistency in the program’s name detract from an otherwise polished adaptation. With a few stylistic adjustments, it would reach near‑perfect quality for native Spanish listeners and readers."
