  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is fragmented and contains numerous incomplete sentences, making it difficult for a native Spanish speaker to follow the logical flow. Key ideas such as the comparison of pre‑training to a university degree are lost or presented in a confusing manner. Some sections are missing entirely or replaced by placeholders, which hampers comprehension.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural phrasings (e.g., \"desenmascarar\" for \"dévoiler\", \"listillo/a\" instead of a proper noun, and abrupt line breaks). Grammatical errors and inconsistent verb tenses further detract from naturalness. A fluent Spanish speaker would find the text stilted and occasionally incomprehensible.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia* and *ventana de contexto* are generally preserved, but their usage is inconsistent. Some key terms are omitted or replaced with unrelated words (e.g., \"aprender en contexto\" is used but the phrase is not introduced correctly). The lack of consistency and occasional mistranslations reduce the accuracy of the terminology.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation does not adequately adapt idiomatic expressions or cultural references. It includes literal translations that feel out of place (e.g., \"desenmascarar\" instead of an equivalent Spanish podcast intro). The overall tone and style are not optimized for a Spanish‑speaking audience, so the intent of the original is weakened.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are missing or garbled, including the crucial explanations about in‑context learning and the memory feature. Important nuances—such as the distinction between temporary knowledge and permanent skill—are either omitted or inaccurately rendered. Consequently, the translation fails to convey all the information present in the source.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a basic grasp of the source material but suffers from significant issues in coherence, fluency, and completeness. Key concepts are lost, many sentences are incomplete, and the overall tone feels awkward. A more thorough revision is needed to make the text understandable, natural, and faithful to the original French script for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\nAverage score: 5.8/20 (rounded to 6/20)."
