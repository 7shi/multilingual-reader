  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally readable, but frequent interjections of French sentences and untranslated segments interrupt the flow. Readers can grasp most concepts, but the lack of clear transitions and the presence of French fragments reduce overall clarity. A score of 12/20 reflects that the text is understandable but not fully smooth.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many constructions feel unnatural or broken. For instance, \"C'est comme enviar ce diplômé suivre une spécialisation\" mixes French and Spanish incorrectly, and the phrase \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotage\" is grammatically wrong. The presence of untranslated English terms such as \"fine‑tuning\" and \"In‑Context Learning\" further disrupts fluency. Hence, the fluency score is 10/20.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are inconsistently handled. \"Pre‑entrenamiento\" and \"afinamiento\" are used correctly, but \"fine‑tuning\" remains in English, and \"ICL\" is not expanded or explained. Additionally, some specialized expressions are left in French, e.g., \"C'est la différence entre bachoter\". Consistency and accuracy issues lower this criterion to 10/20.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to fully adapt the original to Spanish cultural and linguistic norms. Many lines are left in French or English, which indicates poor localization. While the content conceptually aligns with the source, the lack of idiomatic Spanish phrasing and contextual cues reduces the score to 10/20.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several parts of the original are omitted or poorly rendered: the explanation about transfer learning after the pre‑training segment is missing, the French phrase \"C'est comme envoyer…\" remains untranslated, and the final discussion about memory features is truncated. This leads to a significant loss of information, justifying a score of 8/20.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is incomplete and contains numerous errors that hinder comprehension. French fragments embedded within the Spanish text, inconsistent terminology, and omitted sections make the text unsuitable for a professional or academic audience. A comprehensive revision is required to achieve a coherent, accurate, and fully localized version of the original French dialogue. The overall quality is moderate at best, and significant improvement is needed before it can be used as a reliable translation. The aggregated score reflects these issues with an overall score of 10/20 (average of the individual criteria)."
