    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is fragmented and littered with editorial comments, alternative versions, and in‑line notes. While the core dialogue is understandable, the interspersed commentary disrupts the flow and can confuse readers who are expecting a clean, continuous transcript. The overall structure is logical in places, but the added annotations compromise legibility.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The language used in the final passages is largely correct, but there are several awkward phrasing choices and inconsistent punctuation (e.g., ‘preentrenamiento’ vs. ‘pre‑entrenamiento’, missing accents). The presence of commentary fragments also interrupts natural rhythm, making the text feel more like a draft than a polished translation.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most key technical terms are rendered appropriately (“preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “grounding”) and the explanations are generally clear. However, some terms are alternated without consistency (e.g., ‘fine‑tuning’ is kept in English in some places). Overall, terminology handling is acceptable but could be more uniform.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator shows awareness of cultural and register differences (e.g., suggesting more colloquial options). Yet the heavy presence of editorial commentary undermines the sense that the adaptation was aimed at the target audience. The core intent of the podcast (informal yet technical) is preserved, but the presentation suffers.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major concepts from the original are present, and some explanatory footnotes are added. Nonetheless, the numerous alternative versions and omitted lines (e.g., some back‑and‑forth dialogue) create gaps that could confuse readers. The overall information is largely retained, but the presentation is cluttered.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the technical content and offers several good paraphrasing options. However, the final product is not a clean, finished translation but rather a draft laden with editorial notes and multiple variants. For a polished, user‑friendly version, the annotations should be removed, wording streamlined, and terminology standardized. As it stands, the translation is functional but not ready for publication."
