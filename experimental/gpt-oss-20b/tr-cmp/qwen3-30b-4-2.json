    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation presents a clear, logical flow that closely mirrors the original dialogue. Sentences are mostly straightforward, and the conversational tone is preserved, making the content accessible to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor structural issues arise in a few longer sentences where the natural pacing of Spanish might be improved, but overall the text remains comprehensible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The language sounds mostly natural, with a few awkward phrasing choices such as \"Ha comprendido todo\" (should be \"Has comprendido todo\") and the somewhat literal rendering of \"in the sense of\" as \"en el sentido humano del término\". These small slips do not significantly hinder comprehension but do affect smoothness. Overall, the translation reads well for a native speaker.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately translated: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", and \"Memoria\". The use of \"anclaje\" for grounding is appropriate and consistent. No terms are omitted or incorrectly rendered, and explanations are provided where necessary. The terminology is well suited to a general audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The cultural adaptation is effective. The hosts’ names and the show’s title are preserved, and Spanish idiomatic expressions (e.g., \"estudiar a última hora\") fit the target audience. The translation maintains the informal, explanatory style of the original and respects Spanish‑speaking cultural expectations. Minor improvements could be made in phrasing to fully match colloquial usage, but overall the adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue segments from the French original are present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the narrative structure is intact. Redundancies are minimal, and the translation remains concise while conveying the full meaning of the original. The only minor omission is a slightly less explicit reference to \"prompt\" in one sentence, but this does not impact overall understanding.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a strong grasp of both language and content, faithfully preserving the original meaning while adapting it to Spanish.
