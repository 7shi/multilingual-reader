    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand. The sentences are clear, and the logical flow of the original dialogue is maintained. Some clauses are a bit long, but this does not hinder comprehension. The explanation of complex concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL) is faithful and intelligible for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for most parts. Minor issues appear, such as the phrase *“para darle una educación general”* which could be more naturally phrased as *“para brindarle una base general”*. The interchangeable use of *“refinamiento”* and *“ajuste fino”* is acceptable but slightly inconsistent. Overall, the language feels natural and contemporary.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly translated: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, and the French *fine‑tuning* is rendered as *ajuste fino* or *refinamiento*. The terminology is consistent within each concept, though the switch between *refinamiento* and *ajuste fino* could be streamlined. No essential terms are omitted or mistranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and tone, using culturally appropriate expressions (e.g., *desciframos la tecnología*, *consultor brillante*). The Spanish version adapts idioms and maintains a conversational style that fits the podcast context. Only very subtle improvements could be made, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All points from the original French script are present. No significant content is omitted, and the translation keeps the same level of detail and nuance. Redundancies are minimal, and the structure mirrors the source text closely.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the meaning, tone, and technical content of the original French script. Minor fluency tweaks could further polish the text, but the current version is clear, natural, and well‑adapted for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of terminology and contextual nuances, making it suitable for the intended podcast format and listeners.\n\nOverall, it scores highly across all evaluation criteria, reflecting a strong translation effort that balances fidelity, readability, and linguistic fluency."
