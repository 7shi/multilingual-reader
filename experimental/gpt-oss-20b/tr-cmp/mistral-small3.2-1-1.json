  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, but a few repetitions (e.g., the duplicated “Camille:” lines) and slightly awkward phrases (e.g., “empollar”) can momentarily confuse a reader. Sentence structure is mostly logical, though some parts feel fragmented after translation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The overall flow is natural for Spanish speakers, yet there are several minor slips: “Mire” instead of “Mira”, the use of “empollar”, and occasional literal word-for-word carryovers that sound slightly forced. Still, the text reads smoothly for the most part.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, grounding → anclaje. Terminology remains consistent throughout and is appropriate for the target audience. Minor omissions (e.g., leaving the abbreviation ICL untranslated in the first mention) are not critical.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and preserves the conversational tone. Cultural references are kept neutral, but some phrasing could be further adapted for a Spanish‑speaking audience (e.g., replacing “empollar” with a more common expression). Overall, adaptation is adequate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are present; no significant information is omitted. Minor redundant elements appear due to duplication of speaker labels. The content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is good and mostly faithful, capturing the core ideas and tone of the original. Small issues—repeated speaker tags, slightly unnatural word choices, and a few minor grammatical slips—detract from perfect fluency and readability. With minor polishing, it could be considered a high‑quality translation suitable for a native Spanish audience.\n\nOverall score: 16/20\n\nThe main strengths lie in accurate terminology and clear conveyance of concepts, while the weaknesses revolve around stylistic polish and consistency in speaker labeling. A final proofread would resolve the remaining issues and elevate the text to an excellent level of quality."
