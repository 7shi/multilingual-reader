    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the original structure, but several sentences feel fragmented or overly literal, which can hinder smooth reading. Phrases like \"¡El aprendizaje en contexto es memorización.\" and the abrupt switches between formal and informal tone affect coherence. Overall, a reader can follow the dialogue, but the flow would benefit from more natural sentence construction.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation exhibits many natural Spanish expressions and the conversational tone of a podcast is preserved. However, occasional awkward wording (e.g., “¡Lo ha captado perfectamente!” feels slightly mechanical, “¡La IA no ha 'olvidado' en el sentido humano del término; su espacio de trabajo temporal simplemente se ha vaciado.” is a bit long and formal) and inconsistent punctuation reduce fluency. Still, native speakers would grasp the meaning with minimal effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved, but some are left in English or translated literally (e.g., “fine‑tuning” instead of “ajuste fino”, “in‑context learning” as “Aprendizaje en Contexto Interno”). While understandable, these choices are less common in Spanish technical discourse. The use of “grounding” as “anclaje” is acceptable, but the overall terminology consistency could be improved.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the original intent and informal podcast style. Cultural adaptation is minimal because the content is technical and universal. Minor improvements could be made to avoid overly literal phrasing (e.g., replacing “¡Lo ha captado perfectamente!” with a more idiomatic expression), but the overall contextual adaptation is adequate.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present. The translation does not omit critical information and maintains the dialogue structure. Some redundant phrasing (e.g., repeated emphasis on forgetting) is kept for emphasis, which is acceptable in a podcast format. No major omissions or unnecessary additions are evident.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and largely faithful to the original, but it could benefit from better localization of technical terms and smoother, more idiomatic sentence structures. With a few adjustments to terminology and phrasing, it would achieve a higher level of naturalness and clarity for Spanish-speaking audiences."
