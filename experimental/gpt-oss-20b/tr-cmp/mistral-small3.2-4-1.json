  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured, and the speaker turns are preserved. A few longer sentences might be split for maximum clarity, but overall the flow is understandable to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are minor awkwardities: \"Me llamo Camille\" instead of the more common \"Soy Camille\", the shift from \"tu\" to \"usted\" in one line, and the phrase \"de manera permanente\" which feels slightly unnatural. Overall the prose is smooth but not flawless.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"anclaje\". Consistency is maintained throughout and the terminology matches common Spanish usage in AI contexts.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone, including the friendly podcast style and the explanatory nature. Cultural adaptation is adequate; however, the pronoun switch from informal to formal in one line slightly disrupts the consistency. Overall adaptation is good.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines from the original are present, and no important information is omitted. The translation does not add extraneous details that could confuse readers. Minor differences in wording are faithful to the original meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "This is a solid Spanish translation that faithfully reproduces the content, style, and technical details of the original French dialogue. It is mostly natural and clear, though a few pronoun inconsistencies and minor phrasing issues slightly detract from perfect fluency. The translator demonstrates a good grasp of both the subject matter and the target language’s conventions."
