    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, with clear explanations of complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning. The sentence structure is mostly logical, but the translation contains a few typographical errors (“discusiĆ³n”, “sesiĆ³n”) and a duplicated speaker tag (“Luc: Luc:”), which slightly disrupt readability. Overall, the target readers can follow the content but must overlook these minor glitches.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The language is mostly smooth, but there are several awkward phrases and a noticeable duplication of the speaker tag. The translation retains some English terms (e.g., “prompt”, “ICL”) which is acceptable, yet the use of “una forma astuta” and “chuleta” feels informal in a podcast context. Minor grammatical errors and the presence of an English word within a Spanish sentence reduce overall fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", and \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" are correctly rendered. However, \"ancrage\" was left untranslated and should be \"anclaje\". The term \"grounding\" was translated as “ancrage” instead of an appropriate Spanish equivalent. While most terminology is handled correctly, the inconsistency and small mistranslations reduce the score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and cultural references, but some expressions (e.g., “una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”) could be more naturally phrased for a Spanish-speaking audience. The presence of English words like “prompt” and the informal “chuleta” slightly undermine contextual adaptation. Overall, the adaptation is adequate but could be polished.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are present: the stages of AI learning, the difference between ICL and fine‑tuning, and the explanation of memory features. Minor typographical errors do not obscure meaning, and no substantive content is omitted. The redundancy is minimal and the translation remains concise, so the information is largely complete.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation communicates the core ideas of the original French script fairly well. It preserves the structure and technical concepts, but is marred by typographical errors, a duplicated speaker tag, some informal word choices, and a few mis‑translated terms. With a few corrections to punctuation, terminology, and style, the translation could reach a higher level of polish and naturalness for native Spanish listeners of the podcast. Overall, it is a solid effort that would benefit from a final proofread and minor language refinements. 15/20 points."
