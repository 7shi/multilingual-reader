  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is fragmented and interspersed with editorial notes that break the conversational flow. Many sentences are incomplete or abruptly interrupted, making it difficult for a Spanish‑speaking reader to follow the dialogue smoothly. While the basic storyline is present, the overall comprehensibility is significantly reduced.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text contains numerous unnatural expressions, mixed languages (French/English terms left untranslated), and awkward grammatical constructions. Phrases such as \"pre-entraînement\" or \"C'est‑à‑dire?\" are either left in French or poorly rendered. The result is a stilted, hard‑to‑read passage rather than a natural, fluent translation.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly translated correctly (e.g., preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding). However, inconsistencies appear (different spellings, acronyms left unexplained), and some concepts are over‑paraphrased or mixed with explanatory commentary that dilutes precision. Overall, terminology is acceptable but not consistently applied.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator attempts to adapt cultural references, but the inclusion of parenthetical comments and suggested improvements turns the dialogue into a draft rather than a polished adaptation. The original informal, conversational tone is lost, and the text reads more like a technical report with side notes. Cultural nuance is therefore only partially preserved.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The majority of the original content is present, but the inserted editorial remarks create redundancy and some contextual gaps. Certain explanations are omitted or overly simplified, and transitions between segments feel abrupt. The translation is comprehensive in scope but not concise or clean.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation represents a rough draft rather than a finished product. While most of the technical content is preserved, readability, fluency, and contextual adaptation suffer due to fragmented structure and numerous meta‑comments. Terminology is largely correct but inconsistent, and the overall clarity is compromised. A more polished, coherent rendering would significantly improve the quality of the translation and better serve the intended Spanish‑speaking audience. Overall score: 10.2/20, indicating considerable room for improvement in all evaluated aspects."
