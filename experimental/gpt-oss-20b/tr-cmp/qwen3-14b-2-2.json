    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version retains the original sentence structure and logical flow. Most passages are clear and easy to follow. Minor issues arise from slightly long sentences (e.g., \"Imaginen que enviamos una nueva IA a la escuela...\"), but overall the text is comprehensible to native Spanish speakers, especially those with a general education. A few repetitions of words like \"por lo tanto\" and a lack of short, punchy connectors occasionally reduce readability but do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural, with appropriate vocabulary and grammar for Spanish. However, there are a few awkward phrasing choices: \"Imaginen que enviamos una nueva IA...\" could be smoother as \"Imaginen enviar una nueva IA...\", and the phrase \"Es una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\" feels slightly contrived. Minor typographic inconsistencies (e.g., excessive question marks) also slightly affect flow. Nevertheless, the overall fluency remains high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently and accurately rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" -> \"anclaje\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"memoria\". The translation follows common Spanish tech parlance and keeps term consistency throughout the text. No major errors or mistranslations were detected.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal, conversational tone of the podcast. Cultural references are appropriately adapted (e.g., \"¡Una analogía perfecta!\" conveys the same enthusiasm as in French). The Spanish version respects idiomatic usage, and the humor is maintained. The only minor issue is that some idiomatic French expressions are translated literally (e.g., \"c'est la différence entre un cracheur...\" -> \"la diferencia entre cramarse...\"), but this does not distort meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French transcript is present. No substantive omissions were found, and the additional clarifications (e.g., explaining the difference between temporary context and permanent fine‑tuning) are consistent with the source. The translation is concise and free from unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, maintaining the original's meaning, tone, and technical precision. While there are a few minor fluency issues and some slightly awkward phrasing, these do not significantly impact overall readability or comprehension. The translator successfully conveys the nuanced differences between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning, and accurately represents the new \"memory\" feature as a form of automated ICL. Overall, the translation is reliable and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience familiar with AI terminology and podcast dialogue conventions. A final polish could address a handful of stylistic quirks, but the text is already ready for publication or distribution in a Spanish context.\n\nTotal Score: 91/100 (average 18.2/20)."
