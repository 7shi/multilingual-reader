  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to read and the conversational flow mirrors the original French dialogue. Sentences are clear and logical, and the dialogue remains engaging. Minor issues such as the slightly abrupt transition in a few places do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The overall rhythm of the translation is natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Some minor awkwardness appears in phrases that are literal translations (e.g., \"la IA no está constantemente afinada por sus conversaciones\" could be smoother). Vocabulary choices are mostly contemporary and appropriate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms like *pre‑entrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *aprendizaje por transferencia* and *ventana de contexto* are correctly rendered. However, the word *grounding* was left as the French *ancrage* instead of the Spanish *anclaje*, which is inconsistent. This minor slip affects terminology consistency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and tone of a podcast dialogue. Cultural references are kept generic and appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. A few expressions could be further adapted (e.g., using more idiomatic phrasing), but overall contextual adaptation is satisfactory.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present. No significant omissions are noted, and the translation does not add unnecessary filler. The content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is strong and faithful to the original. It reads well and conveys the technical concepts accurately, though a few terminology inconsistencies and slightly awkward phrasing reduce the polish. With minor corrections, it would achieve near‑perfect quality."
