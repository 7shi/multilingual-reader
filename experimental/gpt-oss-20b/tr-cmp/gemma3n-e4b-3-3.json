  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable for a native speaker. Sentences follow a logical order and the dialogue format is preserved. However, a few longer sentences could be broken up for better flow, and some phrasing (“La IA no se afina constantemente a partir de tus conversaciones”) feels slightly clunky, which slightly hampers smooth comprehension. Overall readability is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few unnatural expressions and awkward word choices. For instance, “La IA no se afina constantemente” is not idiomatic Spanish, and “una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado” is a literal, somewhat stilted rendering. Vocabulary choices are generally appropriate, yet the overall fluency would benefit from more idiomatic phrasing and smoother sentence construction.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved (“pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “grounding” → “anclaje”) and understood by the target audience. However, “ventana de contexto” was translated as “contexto amplio”, which deviates from the common terminology. Also, the acronym ICL is kept but not fully explained in Spanish. Consistency is generally good but could be improved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent and humor are mostly retained. Cultural adaptation is reasonable, though some expressions feel directly translated (e.g., “La IA no se afina constantemente”) and could be localized. The Spanish version keeps the conversational tone suitable for a podcast audience. Minor cultural tweaks could enhance the adaptation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French script is present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, anchoring, temporary vs permanent memory, and the “memory” feature. No significant content is omitted, and the translation remains concise without unnecessary repetition. The only slight omission is the explicit mention of “ventana de contexto” replaced by a less common phrase, but the meaning is retained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation effectively conveys the original content’s meaning and structure, making it largely comprehensible to native listeners. While readability and information completeness are strong, fluency and terminology would benefit from more idiomatic phrasing and consistent use of standard technical terms. Overall, the translation is solid but could be polished for a more natural and professional finish for a Spanish-speaking audience of the podcast’s target demographic. The translation is suitable for a general audience but would need minor revisions for a high‑quality, publication‑ready version. The average score reflects these strengths and areas for improvement, yielding an overall rating of 17/20. This indicates good quality with room for refinement in fluency and terminology consistency."
