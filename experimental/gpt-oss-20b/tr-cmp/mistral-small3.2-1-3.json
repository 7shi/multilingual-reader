    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and follows the same logical flow as the French original. Sentences are well‑structured and complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a general audience can understand. Minor hiccups appear in a few places (e.g., the line “¿Qué quieres decir?” which diverges slightly from the original intent and the mix‑phrase “las leyes de l’équilibre”), but these do not severely impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall, the translation reads smoothly for native Spanish speakers. The vocabulary is contemporary and appropriate. Some phrases feel slightly literal or contain small glitches—such as the English word “Precisely” left in a Spanish sentence, the plural “informaciones” instead of the more idiomatic singular “información”, and the French‑Spanish blend “las leyes de l’équilibre.” These do not ruin the flow but reduce the naturalness of the text.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "All technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL (In‑Context Learning), anclaje, grounding, memoria a corto plazo, etc. The translation consistently uses the same terms throughout, and where necessary it preserves the original French acronyms (ICL) with their Spanish explanation. There is no mis‑translation or omission of key terminology.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator successfully adapts expressions for a Spanish‑speaking audience, replacing French idioms with equivalent Spanish ones (e.g., “cajas negras” for “boîtes noires”, “empollar” for “bachotage”). The cultural context is respected, and the overall tone (informative, conversational) is preserved. Only minor mismatches appear in one conversational line, but they do not alter the intended meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No important information from the French original is omitted. The translation includes all explanations, examples, and nuances (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory features). The structure and sequence of the dialogue remain intact, keeping the content concise yet complete.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of very high quality, faithfully conveying the technical concepts and conversational tone of the original French script. Minor linguistic inaccuracies—such as an accidental English fragment, a slightly awkward plural form, and a French phrase inserted into Spanish—do not significantly impact comprehension. With a few small edits, the text would read perfectly natural to native Spanish speakers. Overall, it is an excellent translation."
