    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the structure of the original. However, some sentences feel a bit clunky (e.g., *«joven titulado universitario»* instead of *«joven recién graduado»*), and the repetition of *«por lo tanto»* can break the flow. The concepts are explained in a straightforward way, but a few phrases require a second look for native readers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly natural, but several constructions sound slightly forced: *«por lo tanto, después del preentrenamiento»* and *«el sistema busca rápidamente en sus antiguos intercambios»* feel mechanical. The overall register matches the casual podcast style, yet occasional word choices (e.g., *«memorización»* for *«mémoire»*) could be more idiomatic. The syntax is correct but could be smoother in places.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly rendered (*preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, ventana de contexto, anclaje*). Minor inconsistencies exist (e.g., *«ajuste fino»* vs *«ajuste fino»* is fine, but *«aprenizaje»* should be *«aprendizaje»*). Overall, the terminology is appropriate for the intended audience and consistent throughout the transcript.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural adaptation is adequate; the Spanish audience would recognize terms like *«consultor»* and *«expert permanente»*. Some phrasing could be tweaked for a more native feel, but no major cultural mismatches occur.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present. The explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and the new memory feature is preserved. No key details are omitted, and the additional context about the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge is kept. The transcript remains concise and clear, with no unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and captures the main ideas and conversational flow of the original French script. While the language is largely clear and the technical terms are accurate, there are several spots where phrasing could be polished for a more natural Spanish feel. Minor typographical errors and slightly awkward constructions slightly detract from the overall polish, but the content is fully preserved and comprehensible to a Spanish‑speaking audience. The translation would benefit from a final proofreading round to refine these minor issues and improve fluency, but it already meets the needs of a podcast transcript for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Overall, it is a solid translation that effectively communicates the original message, with a few areas for improvement in naturalness and consistency of terminology usage. Overall score: 17/20."
