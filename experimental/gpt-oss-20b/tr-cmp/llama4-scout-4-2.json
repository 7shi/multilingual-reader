  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely understandable to a native Spanish speaker, but the presence of numerous interleaved editorial comments and occasional incomplete sentences interrupts the flow. Some explanations of technical concepts are clear, yet the overall paragraph structure is fragmented, reducing ease of reading.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While many phrases are natural, the text contains awkward constructions such as \"La mejora\" and repeated fragments that sound more like draft notes than polished prose. The translation occasionally lapses into literal word-for-word renderings that feel stilted to a fluent reader.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly – \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" – and terminology is consistent within each section. Some minor inconsistencies (e.g., \"pre-entrenamiento\" vs. \"preentrenamiento\") are present but do not severely impede comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Cultural adaptation is adequate: greetings and colloquialisms are appropriate for a Spanish-speaking audience. However, the text includes several explanatory notes that are not part of the original narrative, slightly diluting the intended context and tone of the podcast dialogue.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation covers the core content of the original French script, but the interspersed commentary and some omitted line breaks result in a slightly disjointed presentation. No major facts are omitted, yet the structure is less concise than the original, leading to some redundancy.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material and preserves most of its technical detail. Nevertheless, the translation feels more like a draft or annotated version than a finished dialogue. To improve readability and fluency, the author should remove the editorial commentary, streamline the structure, and polish a few awkward phrases. With these adjustments, the text would provide a clear, natural, and engaging experience for Spanish-speaking listeners of the podcast."
