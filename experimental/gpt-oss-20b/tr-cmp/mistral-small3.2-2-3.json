    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally easy to read. Sentences are straightforward and the logical flow of the original dialogue is preserved. Some minor syntactic oddities (e.g., “se le ha enviado una IA completamente nueva a la escuela”) do not impede comprehension, but they slightly affect the natural flow. Overall, readers can understand the concepts without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text is mostly fluent, but several expressions feel literal or slightly awkward. Phrases such as “se le ha enviado una IA completamente nueva a la escuela” or “se ha borrado” could be more idiomatic. The use of “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)” is acceptable but the repetition “aprendizaje en contexto, o aprendizaje en contexto” is redundant. Nevertheless, the overall tone remains conversational and understandable.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “anclado” (grounding). The abbreviation ICL is preserved. Minor inconsistencies arise with “anclado” vs the more common “anclaje”, but terminology remains clear and consistent throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the intent and conversational tone of the original. However, the podcast title changes inconsistently from “Tecnología Revelada” at the beginning to “Tecnología Rápida” at the end, which could confuse listeners. Cultural references are appropriately adapted, but this inconsistency slightly detracts from contextual fidelity.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present. The dialogue flow, examples, and explanations are retained. The only omission is a small redundancy in the phrase “aprendizaje en contexto, o aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, which could be streamlined but does not remove any key content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid overall, preserving the meaning and conversational style of the original. While there are minor issues with fluency and title consistency, the content remains accurate, technically sound, and easily understandable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. With a few small stylistic tweaks, it would achieve a higher level of polish."
