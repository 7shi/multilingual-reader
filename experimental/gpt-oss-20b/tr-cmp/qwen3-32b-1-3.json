    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely understandable and follows the same sentence order as the French original, which helps readers keep track of the dialogue. The explanations of concepts such as pre‑training and fine‑tuning are clear. However, the presence of the placeholder \"#black boxes\" in place of a full sentence and a few slightly awkward phrasing choices (e.g., \"Tienes todo claro\") slightly reduce overall readability. Nonetheless, readers should be able to follow the discussion without major difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text flows smoothly for most of the dialogue, with natural phrasing and appropriate use of verbs and prepositions. Some expressions feel slightly formal or informal at points (e.g., \"chuleta\" for a cheat sheet) which may not fit all audiences. The placeholder \"#black boxes\" also interrupts fluency. Overall the translation sounds native, but a few adjustments could improve naturalness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly translated and consistently used: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, ancrage (grounding). Abbreviations such as ICL are not expanded, which could be clarified, but otherwise the terminology is appropriate and understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The translation provides enough context for most terms.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and humor of the dialogue. Cultural adaptation is adequate: references to consulting and educational analogies translate well. The only issue is the placeholder line, which fails to convey the original idea that people often view AI as black boxes. Minor adjustments in colloquial language could improve resonance with Spanish listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several lines from the original are missing or replaced by a placeholder, notably the explanation that people view AI as black boxes. The core technical discussion is present, but the omitted lines reduce completeness. No major new information is added, and redundancy is generally avoided, but the translation does not fully convey every point made in the French version.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is overall good, capturing the main technical content and conversational tone. However, the presence of a placeholder and a few missing sentences reduce completeness. With minor edits—replacing \"#black boxes\" with an appropriate explanatory sentence and smoothing some colloquial expressions—the translation would achieve a higher quality score. The translation still provides clear explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning, making it useful for Spanish‑speaking audiences interested in AI fundamentals. Consider adding an expansion for ICL and reviewing informal terms to match the intended audience level before finalizing the script. The final product would then serve well for a podcast or educational setting. "
