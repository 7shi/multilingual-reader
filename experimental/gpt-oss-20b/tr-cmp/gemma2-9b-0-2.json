  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely understandable to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Most sentences are straightforward, and the core ideas are preserved. However, a few awkward or literal translations (e.g., \"una antisèche\", \"funciones de memorización\") momentarily disrupt the flow, reducing readability slightly. Overall, the reader can follow the narrative, but a more polished phrasing would improve clarity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation feels generally natural, but several phrases sound awkward or too literal, such as \"funciones de memorización\", \"una antisèche\", and the use of quotation marks around \"olvidado\". The syntax is mostly correct, yet the vocabulary choices sometimes feel forced or inconsistent, which lowers fluency. A smoother, idiomatic rewrite would elevate the naturalness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are translated correctly: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"fine-tuning\" (though mistakenly rendered as \"afianzamiento\" instead of \"afinamiento\"), \"in-context learning\" (ICL) and \"anclaje\". Some terminology is off or awkward: \"funciones de memorización\" should be \"funciones de memoria\", and \"una antisèche\" is a literal import that Spanish readers might find confusing. Consistency is good, but a few errors diminish the precision.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and humor of the original dialogue are maintained. Cultural adaptation is mostly adequate; however, the translation sometimes sticks too closely to the French phrasing (e.g., \"una antisèche\"), which can feel out of place. More adaptation—choosing phrases that resonate naturally with Spanish-speaking audiences—would strengthen this criterion.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French text is present. No substantial omissions or additions that alter meaning are observed. The translation stays concise and preserves the dialogue structure. Slight redundancy in phrasing (e.g., repeated use of \"una antisèche\") is not problematic for comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and conveys the main ideas of the original French script. Nevertheless, it suffers from a few literal translations and awkward word choices that interrupt readability and fluency. Correcting these minor issues—especially the terminology missteps—would raise the translation to a high‑quality standard while keeping the conversational tone intact. Overall, it is a solid effort that would benefit from a final polishing pass to address the highlighted quirks and ensure idiomatic, natural Spanish prose throughout the dialogue. The translation is good, but a few revisions would make it excellent."
