    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version follows a clear, logical sequence that mirrors the original French dialogue. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the narrative flow is easy to follow. Minor hiccups in phrasing (e.g., “de último momento” instead of “a último momento”) do not impede comprehension, but they slightly reduce readability. Overall, readers can grasp the concepts without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds largely natural to a native Spanish speaker. The vocabulary is contemporary and the syntax is smooth. However, some expressions feel a bit forced – for example, “Aprendizaje Contextual Instruccional” is awkward, and “de último momento” is less idiomatic than “a último momento”. These instances slightly detract from overall fluency. The use of exclamation marks and punctuation is consistent with conversational Spanish podcasts.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are rendered correctly: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, etc. The main issue is the mislabeling of ICL as “Aprendizaje Contextual Instruccional (ICL)”, which misrepresents the original acronym and may confuse readers. Additionally, “grounding” was translated as “anclaje”, which is acceptable but could have been “fundamentación” or “apoyo”. Overall terminology is coherent but could benefit from a more faithful handling of acronyms.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the intent and informal tone of a podcast aimed at a general audience. Cultural references are appropriate, and the dialogue feels conversational. Minor adjustments – such as using “a último momento” – would enhance cultural authenticity, but the current version still aligns well with Spanish‑speaking listeners’ expectations.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the original French script is present. No significant information was omitted or distorted, and the narrative remains concise. The only notable addition is the expanded phrase for ICL, which, while not detrimental to comprehension, slightly alters the technical meaning. Overall, the translation maintains full informational integrity.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, effectively conveying the original podcast’s content and conversational style. Minor inaccuracies – particularly in the handling of the ICL acronym and a few slightly awkward phrasings – do not majorly impact understanding. With some fine‑tuning of terminology and idiomatic expressions, the translation could reach near‑perfect fidelity. It is recommended for immediate publication with minimal edits focused on those areas. Overall, it is a solid, listener‑friendly rendition that serves its target audience well."
