  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the flow of dialogue is maintained. However, some sentences are a bit long and could be split for clarity, especially where the original French uses short, punchy exchanges. Overall, readers can understand the content without major effort.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly natural for a native Spanish speaker, but a few expressions feel slightly awkward. For example, \"la IA no se afina constantemente\" sounds unnatural; a more common phrasing would be \"la IA no se ajusta constantemente\". The colloquial use of \"chuleta\" for \"antisèche\" is informal and may not suit all audiences. Minor grammatical redundancies also appear. These issues slightly reduce the overall fluency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly in most cases: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"grounding (anclaje)\", and \"memoria a corto plazo\" are appropriate. The term \"fine‑tuning\" is left in English; translating it as \"ajuste fino\" would improve consistency. The word \"memoria\" for the new feature is clear, but the explanation could be a bit more explicit. Overall, terminology is mostly correct but not flawless.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue’s informal, conversational tone is preserved, and local expressions such as \"Hola y bienvenidos\" and \"una chuleta\" match the podcast setting. Cultural adaptation is adequate; however, the informal slang could be seen as slightly too casual for a general Spanish-speaking audience. The adaptation maintains the intent and purpose of the original.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant information from the original French script is omitted. All key points – pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory – are present. The Spanish version adds a few clarifications (e.g., describing memory as “una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”) that help understanding without adding redundancy.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation faithfully conveys the original dialogue’s meaning and structure, with good handling of technical terms and contextual tone. Minor issues in fluency and some word choices slightly detract from a fully polished text, but overall the Spanish version is clear, comprehensive, and suitable for a podcast audience. With a few small refinements—especially smoothing out awkward phrasing and unifying terminology—this would be an excellent translation."
