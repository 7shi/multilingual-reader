    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural overall, but contains a few awkward expressions – e.g. the retained French verb \"bachoter\" and a redundant comma after \"contexto\" – that slightly reduce the flow.",

    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"ventana de contexto\" are correctly translated and used consistently. The single mistranslated word \"bachoter\" is the only slip.",

      "reasoning": "The translation takes into account Spanish cultural norms, using idiomatic expressions where appropriate and keeping the friendly, informal style of the original. Only a few small adjustments could improve naturalness.",

    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation delivers the content accurately with good readability and mostly natural language. Minor issues—such as the misuse of the French verb \"bachoter\" and an unnecessary comma—reduce fluency slightly, but the overall quality is high. The technical terminology is handled well and the cultural adaptation is appropriate for a Spanish-speaking audience. The translation is thus a solid, near‑perfect rendition of the original podcast script, suitable for native listeners who expect clear, conversational Spanish with precise technical explanations. The overall evaluation reflects an average score of about 18.4 out of 20, indicating excellent quality with room for minor polish in fluency and terminology consistency.\n\nThis assessment is based on a detailed review of readability, fluency, terminology, contextual adaptation, and information completeness, each weighed equally to arrive at the final score. The translation demonstrates strong competence in conveying the original intent while maintaining natural language flow for the target audience.\n\nOverall, it is a highly competent translation, achieving a near‑perfect score.\n\n**Overall Score**: 18.4 / 20."
