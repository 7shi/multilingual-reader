    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. The paragraph structure mirrors the original and key ideas are presented in a logical sequence. Minor issues arise from repeated use of the phrase ‘por lo tanto’, which can feel redundant and interrupt the flow. Overall, readers with a basic understanding of Spanish should grasp the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for most parts, but a few constructions feel slightly awkward for native Spanish speakers. Examples include the frequent repetition of ‘por lo tanto’, the use of ‘es como’ in some sentences, and the phrasing ‘se le ha proporcionado un resumen justo antes de que comenzara a hablar con usted’ (should be ‘comience’). These quirks lower the naturalness score but do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved correctly: ‘preentrenamiento’, ‘fine‑tuning’ rendered as ‘afinado’, ‘aprendizaje por transferencia’, ‘ventana de contexto’, ‘aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)’, ‘grounding’ as ‘anclaje’, and ‘memoria’ for the new feature. Consistency is maintained throughout the transcript. Minor variations in phrasing (e.g., ‘afinado’ instead of ‘fine‑tuning’) do not affect understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and tone, and cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish-speaking audience. The explanation of technical concepts remains faithful, and there is no loss of nuance. The only contextual issue is the repeated phrase ‘por lo tanto’, which could be varied for stylistic polish.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French transcript is present. No key points are omitted, and the overall length remains comparable. The translation sometimes repeats sentences verbatim, which is harmless but could be trimmed for conciseness. No critical details are missing.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation provides a clear, mostly fluent rendering of the French source, preserving technical accuracy and intent. Minor stylistic adjustments would improve readability and naturalness, but the current version is competent and reliable for a general Spanish-speaking audience interested in AI concepts. The overall quality is solid, reflecting good but not perfect translation practice."
