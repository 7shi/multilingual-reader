  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable to native speakers, especially the core concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning. However, the presence of untranslated French fragments (e.g., \"L'apprentissage par transfert est la clé.\") and occasional abrupt switches between English technical terms and Spanish disrupt the flow, making some passages feel disjointed. Sentence structures are mostly clear, but the errors can momentarily confuse the reader.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural elements: misspelled words like \"Exattamente\" and the retention of French phrases. Some expressions feel clunky (e.g., \"*prompt* son temporales\" – the asterisks are odd in a Spanish text). Overall, the rhythm of the language is acceptable, but these quirks lower the smoothness for a native audience.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"in‑context learning (ICL)\" and \"grounding\" are correctly rendered. Nonetheless, there is inconsistency in the use of English vs. Spanish (e.g., \"ajuste fino\" vs. \"fine‑tuning\"), which could confuse readers. The terminology is largely appropriate but could be more consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator tries to adapt cultural references (e.g., the consultant analogy), but the leftover French and English fragments reduce the adaptation quality. Some Spanish idiomatic expressions are present, yet the overall tone leans toward a literal translation rather than a fully localized one.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is preserved: the stages of learning, the explanation of transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory features, and the concluding remarks. Minor omissions are negligible, and no major concepts are missing. The redundancy is not excessive, though the mix of languages could be streamlined.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core ideas and technical details but is hampered by untranslated French fragments, inconsistent terminology, and occasional unnatural phrasing. With a careful cleanup—removing French remnants, standardizing terminology, and smoothing sentence flow—the text would reach a high level of quality for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The overall quality is acceptable for a draft but needs polishing for a final publication."
