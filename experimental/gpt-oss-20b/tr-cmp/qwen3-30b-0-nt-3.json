  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow; sentence structures are clear and logical. Minor long sentences could be broken up, but overall the target audience can understand the content without confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly overall, but there are a few unnatural phrasing and minor grammatical slips, such as \"la IA no se ajusta constantemente con sus conversaciones\" and \"Se apoya en fundaciones extremadamente sólidas.\" These do not impede comprehension but slightly affect naturalness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered (pre-entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, anclaje, Memoria) and consistently used throughout. No major mistranslations or omissions. The terminology is suitable for a general audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references well (e.g., comparing the AI to a consultant). The tone and style match a Spanish‑speaking podcast. No awkward cultural references were left untranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French transcript are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory, and the consultant metaphor. No essential information is omitted; the content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, accurately conveying the technical concepts and conversational tone of the original. Minor grammatical and phrasing adjustments would improve fluency, but the current version is already understandable and faithful to the source text. Overall, it scores well above average, demonstrating strong competence in technical translation and cultural adaptation for Spanish readers."
