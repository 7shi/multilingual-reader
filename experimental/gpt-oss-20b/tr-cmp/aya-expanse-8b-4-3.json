    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is difficult to read because many sentences are broken, missing verbs, or duplicated. While a native Spanish speaker could parse the general idea, the flow is disrupted and some paragraphs feel like a collage of fragments rather than a coherent dialogue. The lack of clear paragraph breaks and inconsistent punctuation further hampers readability.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains numerous unnatural expressions, such as \"piense en una nueva IA que asiste a la escuela\" and \"el modelo es como contratar un experto altamente calificado\". Many sentences have awkward word order and missing articles, making the text sound mechanical and not idiomatic. Vocabulary choices are generally appropriate but the overall rhythm and flow of the dialogue are weak.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms like \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"fine-tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL) are present, though occasionally misspelled (e.g., \"preentrenamiento\"). However, consistency is lacking—sometimes \"en contexto\" is used, sometimes \"conversacional\". Explanations of complex ideas are missing or garbled in several places, so the terminology does not fully support the reader’s understanding.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue preserves the original intent but many cultural references (e.g., “asistir a la escuela”) feel out of place for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The translation fails to adapt idiomatic expressions or localize references to the target culture. Some parts are over‑literal, which reduces the natural feel of the conversation.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is represented, but several sections are omitted or duplicated, leading to redundancy. Important clarifications—such as the difference between temporary and permanent memory—are sometimes missing or poorly articulated. The translation does not fully eliminate repetition, and some nuances are lost, reducing overall completeness.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation displays a clear attempt to render the original French dialogue into Spanish, but it suffers from significant issues in structure, fluency, and consistency. While key concepts are present, the text feels disjointed and unnatural, limiting its effectiveness for a Spanish‑speaking audience. A revision focusing on coherent sentence construction, consistent terminology, and cultural adaptation would markedly improve the quality."
