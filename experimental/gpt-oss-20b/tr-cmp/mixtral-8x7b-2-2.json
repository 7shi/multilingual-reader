  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable for native readers. Sentences follow the original structure, and the main ideas are clear. However, the occasional literal word‑for‑word translation and missing brief explanations for some technical terms make a few parts feel less smooth. Therefore, the overall readability is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several awkward phrasings and some grammatical errors (e.g., \"una memoria a corto plazo\" instead of \"memoria a corto plazo\", \"pizarrón\" is an odd choice). The flow is disrupted by inconsistent punctuation and a few literal stretches. A native speaker would notice these as unnatural, so fluency is moderate.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally translated correctly (preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning), but inconsistencies arise (e.g., \"la especialización\" vs. \"fine‑tuning\"), and some terms lack contextual explanation (e.g., \"anclaje\" is used without the original nuance). Overall, terminology is understandable but not consistently applied.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone, but some cultural adjustments could improve it (e.g., using \"consultor\" instead of \"consultor brillante\" or simplifying idioms). The dialogue style is preserved, yet the adaptation could be smoother for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The score reflects adequate, but room for improvement.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present; no critical omissions are detected. The translation does not add unnecessary detail and keeps the content concise. Some small clarifications from the original are missing but do not hinder understanding, giving it a solid completeness rating.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation communicates the essential content and keeps the dialogue format intact. However, it suffers from occasional unnatural phrasing, inconsistent terminology, and a few stylistic choices that feel literal rather than adapted for a native Spanish audience. With some polishing—especially in the use of technical terms and smoother sentence construction—the overall quality could be noticeably higher. The current version is serviceable but not polished enough for a professional broadcast or publication aimed at native Spanish speakers. The score reflects this balanced assessment, highlighting both strengths (information coverage, readability) and weaknesses (fluency, terminology consistency)."
