  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to read for a native speaker. Sentences are short and the dialogue format is preserved, so the listener can follow the flow. However, some passages (e.g., “Aprendizaje contextual, es memoria de estudios” or “Cuando begins una nueva conversación”) contain awkward phrasing or mixed English words that may momentarily confuse the reader. The overall comprehension is still high, so a score of 16/20 is justified.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation has many instances of non‑natural phrasing and a few English words that intrude (e.g., “begins”, “starts”). There are also minor grammatical errors such as “Aprendizaje contextual, es memoria de estudios”. While the text still reads smoothly in most places, these issues lower the naturalness of the dialogue, leading to a score of 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered (“pre-entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje en contexto”). However, there are inconsistencies and inaccuracies: “encaje” is not the usual translation of “ancrage”; “enraizamiento” appears only once; “Aprendizaje In‑Context” mixes English and Spanish. These errors may cause confusion for a technical audience. Therefore the score is 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue keeps the informal, conversational tone suitable for a podcast and references the target audience (Spanish‑speaking listeners). Cultural references are minimal and acceptable. Minor mistranslations in terminology slightly dilute the intended meaning, but the overall intent is preserved, giving a score of 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the original—pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, temporary vs. permanent memory—are present. No critical information is omitted, and the explanation is concise. Small wording errors do not materially affect understanding, so the translation is largely complete, meriting 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is understandable and captures the main concepts, but it suffers from several terminology inaccuracies, mixed‑language fragments, and occasional grammatical slips. With a few corrections—especially to the terminology (“anclaje” instead of “encaje”, consistent use of “aprendizaje en contexto”, removal of English words—the translation could reach a high level of quality."
