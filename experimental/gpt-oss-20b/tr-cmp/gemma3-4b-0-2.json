  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, but several sentences are awkwardly constructed and a sentence is duplicated, which disrupts flow. The use of informal pronouns (‘tu’) inconsistently with the formal tone of the original also slightly hinders clarity. Overall, readers can follow the dialogue but the experience is not seamless.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most vocabulary is correct, the text contains several unnatural phrasing choices such as \"se le proporcionan las informaciones de las que necesita\" and repeated sentences. Some grammatical errors (e.g., plural noun usage, missing accents) further affect smoothness. The overall rhythm feels slightly mechanical rather than natural to a native speaker.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: ‘pre-entrenamiento’, ‘ajuste fino’, ‘aprendizaje en contexto’, ‘ventana de contexto’, ‘anclaje’. The translation keeps consistent terminology and appropriately explains concepts. Minor issues with the word ‘informaciones’ instead of ‘información’ slightly detract but do not compromise comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the intent and style of the original dialogue. However, switching between formal ‘usted’ and informal ‘tu’ breaks consistency, and some idiomatic expressions (e.g., ‘se le proporcionan las informaciones…’) are not fully adapted to Spanish cultural norms. Minor adjustments would improve contextual fidelity.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the source are present, and the overall structure is maintained. The duplicated line is a redundancy rather than an omission. No critical information is lost, and the translation stays concise. Minor omissions in nuance (e.g., the subtle contrast between temporary vs permanent learning) are negligible.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and largely faithful to the original French script. It accurately conveys technical terms and maintains the conversational tone. However, the presence of repeated sentences, inconsistent formality, and several unnatural phrase choices reduce readability and fluency. A thorough proof‑read focusing on natural expressions and consistency would raise the quality to a near‑native level. The translation would benefit from tightening the text, correcting plural forms, and unifying the pronoun register to fully satisfy a native Spanish audience."
