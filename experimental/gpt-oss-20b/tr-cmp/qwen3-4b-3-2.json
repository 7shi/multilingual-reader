    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and follows a logical sentence structure. However, some awkward phrasing (e.g., *a un entrenamiento*, *estudiar a la última*) and a few typographical errors (e.g., *francque*, *aprendra*) slightly hinder smooth reading. Overall, listeners can grasp the content but may need to pause on these spots.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally natural for native Spanish speakers, but several expressions feel forced or non‑idiomatic: *a un entrenamiento* instead of *a una escuela*, *precalentamiento* instead of a more common phrase, and *estudiar a la última* is unclear. These reduce the overall fluency. The vocabulary is mostly appropriate, but some word choices could be improved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved: *preentrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ICL*, *grounding* (anclaje). The translation is consistent, though occasionally the original hyphenated form *pre‑entrenamiento* is used without the hyphen. Minor inconsistencies do not detract from comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and adapts expressions for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are maintained, and the overall tone matches a podcast conversation. Small adjustments (e.g., *“a un entrenamiento”* instead of *“a una escuela”*) do not alter meaning. Overall, contextual adaptation is good.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present, including the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning, the role of memory, and the practical implications. No major omissions were found. Some redundant or slightly unclear phrases exist, but they do not compromise overall clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and largely faithful to the original French. It conveys the technical concepts and the conversational style effectively. Minor grammatical issues and some unnatural word choices slightly reduce readability and fluency, but the overall message remains clear and accurate. With a few polish‑ups—especially correcting typos, smoothing awkward phrases, and choosing more idiomatic expressions—the translation would reach a near‑perfect level."
