  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely clear and easy to follow. Sentences are mostly short, and technical concepts are presented in a straightforward manner. Minor structural repetitions (e.g., repeated use of \"El aprendizaje en contexto\") do not hinder comprehension. The overall flow remains logical, and readers can grasp the content without confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds generally natural, but there are a few spots that feel slightly mechanical or awkward. Examples include \"Imaginen que enviamos una IA completamente nueva a la escuela\" (a more idiomatic phrasing would be \"Imaginen enviar una IA…\"), the use of both formal \"usted\" and informal \"tú\" forms in close proximity, and the phrase \"una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje contextual automatizado\" which is a literal but clunky rendering. These issues slightly affect the smoothness for a native reader, but they do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled accurately and consistently. \"Preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"anclaje\" are all appropriate Spanish equivalents. The translation also correctly uses the English term \"ICL\" where it is introduced and then provides the Spanish equivalent. No major terminology errors or omissions were found.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and purpose of the original French text are effectively conveyed. Cultural adaptation is generally adequate, though the mix of formal and informal address could be streamlined for consistency. The translation maintains the explanatory tone and keeps the dialogue natural for a Spanish-speaking audience. Minor improvements could be made in choosing expressions that better suit Spanish podcast conventions, but overall the adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original script are present in the translation. No significant information is omitted, and the structure mirrors the French version closely. Redundancy is minimal, and the translation remains concise while covering the same content. There are no gaps in conveying the main ideas.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, effectively conveying the meaning and intent of the original French script. While there are a few minor fluency issues and some stylistic choices that could be polished, the translation remains clear, technically accurate, and faithful to the source material. Overall, it is a strong rendering suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience listening to a podcast about AI learning techniques."
