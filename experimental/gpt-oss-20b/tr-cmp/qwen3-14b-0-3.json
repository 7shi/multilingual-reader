  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly understandable and follows a logical order similar to the French source. However, several sentences are awkwardly phrased or contain literal repetitions (e.g., “Lo han entendido todo” with ellipses) that can momentarily confuse the reader. Minor punctuation and article usage errors (e.g., “Las lenguas son un excelente ejemplo” instead of “Los idiomas”) also slightly hinder smooth reading. Overall, the text is readable but could be clearer in a few spots.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds conversational but suffers from several unnatural expressions: repeated ellipses, inconsistent verb forms, and occasional misplacement of articles (“las informaciones”). The use of “Lo han entendido todo” is awkward, and the phrase “Se puede tener una conversación larga y detallada” is correct but somewhat stilted. These issues reduce the overall fluency for native Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved correctly (“preentrenamiento,” “afinamiento,” “aprendizaje por transferencia,” “ICL”). The parenthetical “fine-tuning” is left in English, which is acceptable for a technical audience, but the translation of “grounding” to “anclaje” is appropriate. Some terms like “informaciones” should be singular (“información”), and “Memoria” is capitalized without justification. Consistency is good, though a few minor slips exist.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation to a Spanish-speaking audience is generally adequate; idiomatic expressions such as “se acuerda” and the comparison to a consultant are culturally understandable. However, some phrases remain overly literal (e.g., “Los lenguas” instead of “Los idiomas”) and could be polished for naturalness. No significant cultural missteps, but room for refinement.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the essential information from the original. No major content is omitted; the dialogue flow and key explanations remain intact. There are minor repetitions and a few lines that could be more concise, but overall the information is complete and coherent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation delivers the main ideas of the French source and is largely comprehensible, but it shows several areas that need polish: unnatural phrasing, inconsistent article usage, and minor repetition. The technical terminology is largely correct and consistently applied. With some refinement for fluency and consistency, the translation could reach a higher level of quality."
