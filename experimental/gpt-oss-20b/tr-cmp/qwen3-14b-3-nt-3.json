    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version uses clear, simple sentence structures that follow the same logical flow as the French source. Complex concepts such as pre‑training and fine‑tuning are explained with analogies (new graduate, consultant) that are easy to understand. Minor syntactic oddities (“para que adquiera una cultura general”) do not hinder comprehension. Overall, readers can follow the dialogue without confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly and largely sounds natural to native Spanish speakers. However, there are a few awkward expressions and a couple of grammatical inconsistencies: the use of a hyphen in “preentrenamiento” (instead of the usual “pre‑entrenamiento”), the phrase “Aprendizaje Contextual Instruccional (ICL)” which is a mistranslation, and some repetition such as “se abre una nueva ventana”. Despite these, the overall flow remains fluent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are generally translated correctly – pre‑training (pre‑entrenamiento), fine‑tuning (afinamiento), transfer learning (aprendizaje por transferencia), and in‑context learning (aprendizaje en contexto). The term “grounding” is rendered as “anclaje”, which is appropriate. The main issue is the incorrect “Aprendizaje Contextual Instruccional” for ICL and inconsistent use of “afinamiento” versus “ajuste fino” for fine‑tuning. Consistency would improve the score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue tone is preserved; the Spanish version keeps the conversational style and the same analogies (graduate, consultant). Cultural references are appropriate – for instance, “ventana” for chat window and “consultor brillante”. Some expressions could be slightly refined (“se abre una nueva ventana” could be “se abre una nueva conversación”), but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All substantive content from the French original is present in the Spanish translation. No key ideas are omitted, and the explanation of the memory feature, ICL, and fine‑tuning is intact. Minor redundancies exist (e.g., repeated mention of “una nueva ventana”), but they do not detract from clarity. The translation is comprehensive.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful and readable, capturing the main ideas and conversational tone of the original French dialogue. It demonstrates solid comprehension of the technical concepts and effectively communicates them to a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, a few terminology errors and awkward phrasings slightly diminish the fluency and precision. With minor revisions—especially correcting the ICL mistranslation and smoothing a few expressions—the translation would reach an excellent standard."
