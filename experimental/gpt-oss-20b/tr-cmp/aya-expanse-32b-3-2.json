  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow, with clear sentence structures and logical flow. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in plain language. Some long sentences could be shortened for even smoother reading, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor awkwardness appears in phrases like \"¡Y soy Luc!\" and the repeated use of quotation marks around technical terms. Grammar is correct, but a few word choices (e.g., \"levantarse el velo\" instead of the more common \"desvelar\") slightly affect smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL), \"anclaje\" for grounding, and \"Memoria\" for the feature. Consistency is maintained throughout, and necessary explanations are provided when needed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and tone, adapting idiomatic expressions to Spanish culture. Cultural references are appropriate, and the dialogue feels natural to a Spanish‑speaking audience. No significant misinterpretations were detected.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines from the French original are preserved. No critical information was omitted, and the added explanatory notes enhance clarity. The structure remains concise, and redundancy is minimal.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely faithful and readable, with competent handling of terminology and context. Minor fluency tweaks would improve naturalness, but overall the Spanish version conveys the original meaning effectively and is suitable for its intended audience. Minor stylistic refinements could elevate it to a professional‑grade translation, but it already functions well as a public‑facing podcast script in Spanish. The translation balances fidelity and readability, making it a solid adaptation of the French source material. The overall score reflects strong performance across all criteria, with room for small polish improvements in phrasing and conciseness. Overall score: 84/100 (18/20)."
