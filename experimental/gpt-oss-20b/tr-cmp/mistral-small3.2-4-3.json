  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow, with clear explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning. Sentence structure is mostly logical, though some minor grammatical slips (missing articles, misplaced commas) slightly disrupt flow. Overall, readers can understand the content without much effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation often sounds natural, but there are several awkward expressions: the accidental duplication “Luc: Luc:”, the formal “Cuando usted abre una nueva ventana” in an otherwise informal dialogue, and phrases like “Tal es la realidad del Aprendizaje en Contexto”. These reduce the smoothness and make the text feel slightly mechanical. Nonetheless, vocabulary choice is mostly appropriate and contemporary.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered – pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje. Consistency is good, though the occasional mistranslation “memory” into “memoria” is acceptable in context. No significant terminology errors are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone, but the mix of formal (usted) and informal (tú) forms breaks the conversational consistency. Some expressions could be more idiomatic for a Spanish‑speaking audience (e.g., “tal es la realidad” → “esa es la realidad”). Cultural adaptation is largely correct, but minor adjustments would improve resonance.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present – the stages of training, the analogy of a consultant, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the new “Memory” feature. There is no substantive omission or redundancy, so the content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original message accurately and is largely readable, but fluency suffers from a few awkward phrasings and inconsistency in formality. Technical terminology is handled well, and the content is complete. A polished rewrite of the stilted sentences and a uniform use of the informal register would raise the overall quality to near‑perfect."
