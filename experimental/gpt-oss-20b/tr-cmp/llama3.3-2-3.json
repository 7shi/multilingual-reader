  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to read; most sentences follow a logical order and the dialogue is clearly separated. Minor issues appear in a few long sentences where a comma could improve flow, but overall the content is comprehensible even for non‑expert readers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads mostly naturally; however, there are a few awkward phrasings (e.g., *\"La IA no se perfecciona constantemente con tus conversaciones\"* could be smoother). Some gender‑number inconsistencies and missing accents (e.g., *\"la IA se siente\"* instead of *\"la IA se siente\"*) slightly reduce the naturalness. The dialogue still feels conversational.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly translated: *pré‑entraînement → pre‑entrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning → afinamiento*, *learning by transfer → aprendizaje por transferencia*, *in‑context learning → aprendizaje en contexto*. The only notable mistake is the expansion of ICL as *Inteligencia Computacional Limitada*, which is incorrect. Terminology consistency is otherwise good.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is well adapted to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using idiomatic expressions such as *\"como estudiar para un examen\"* and *\"consejos de un consultor\"*. Cultural references are minimal and handled appropriately. The only area for improvement is a slightly more natural wording in some conversational turns.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves all the original dialogue and ideas; no major content is omitted. A small semantic shift occurs with the ICL expansion, but the overall meaning remains intact. Minor redundancies are absent, and the text stays concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and largely faithful to the original French dialogue. It preserves the structure, main concepts, and conversational tone. A few technical inaccuracies (ICL expansion) and minor fluency issues slightly detract from its polish, but the overall quality is high and suitable for native Spanish speakers familiar with AI terminology. With some fine‑tuning of terminology and smoothing of a few sentences, the translation could reach near‑native quality."
