    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, with clear explanations of concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning. Sentence structure follows standard Spanish patterns, making the text accessible to general readers. Minor issues (e.g., the typo “partes” instead of “parte” and some awkward phrasing) slightly reduce clarity, but overall comprehension remains high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly in most places, and vocabulary is appropriate. However, a few constructions feel slightly literal or awkward (e.g., “volvemos a entrenar a la IA para convertirla en una especialista” and the use of parentheses with English acronyms). These moments interrupt the natural flow for native Spanish speakers. Overall, the fluency is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are rendered correctly (e.g., pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto). The term “grounding” is left in French (‘ancrage’) rather than the Spanish ‘anclaje’, which is inconsistent. Acronyms like ICL are kept in English with a brief Spanish explanation, which is acceptable. Some terminology could be more consistent and fully translated.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the conversational tone and the structure of the dialogue, adapting idioms to Spanish when appropriate (e.g., comparing fine‑tuning to a specialization). Cultural references remain neutral and suitable for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Minor inaccuracies (e.g., the typo “partes”) and a few literal phrasings slightly weaken the adaptation, but the overall intent and purpose are maintained.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present: the stages of training, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the concept of grounding, the temporary nature of ICL memory, the introduction of a memory feature, and the final reflection. No essential information is omitted, and the text is concise without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core ideas of the original podcast episode with a solid level of readability and fidelity. While the fluency and terminology sections reveal minor lapses—particularly the mix of French and English terms and some slightly awkward phrasing—the overall message is clear and culturally adapted for Spanish readers. Refinements could include fully translating all technical terms, correcting small typos, and smoothing a few literal constructions to enhance naturalness."
