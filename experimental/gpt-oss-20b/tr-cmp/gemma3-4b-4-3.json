  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is difficult to follow due to frequent breaks, missing words, and repeated fragments. Sentences are often incomplete or abruptly cut off, which hampers comprehension even for native readers familiar with the topic.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many awkward grammatical constructions (e.g., \"Les proporcionamos a una nueva IA acceso a una cantidad masiva…\"), non‑native phrasing, and inconsistent punctuation. These elements make the text sound clunky and unnatural to a fluent Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are inconsistently rendered. \"Pre-entrenamiento\" is correct, but terms like \"grounding\" are left untranslated or poorly paraphrased. The abbreviation \"ICL\" is introduced but never expanded, and phrases such as \"memory\" are sometimes rendered as \"Memoria\" without contextual explanation. Overall terminology usage lacks precision and consistency.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to preserve the informal podcast tone but frequently misinterprets cultural nuances. Several idiomatic expressions from the French original are lost or mistranslated, and the adapted references do not resonate with a Spanish‑speaking audience. The context is not fully respected, resulting in a loss of intent in several passages.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Significant portions of the original dialogue are missing, truncated, or duplicated in the Spanish version. Important clarifications (e.g., the distinction between fine‑tuning and in‑context learning) are omitted or presented in a garbled form, leading to an incomplete and confusing narrative.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is substantially below an acceptable standard. It contains numerous structural and linguistic errors, inconsistent terminology, and critical omissions. A revision that faithfully follows the source, maintains natural flow, and ensures complete, coherent content is necessary for a quality Spanish version of the podcast transcript."
