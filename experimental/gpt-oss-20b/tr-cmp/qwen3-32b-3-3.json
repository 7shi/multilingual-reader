  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow, with clear sentence structure and logical progression. Minor issues arise from literal phrasing such as \"una cantidad muy grande de datos\" which feels slightly stilted, but overall the audience can understand the content without confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker, though a few expressions feel slightly literal or awkward – e.g., \"tome en cuenta\" and the repeated use of \"sistema inteligente\". Vocabulary choices are mostly appropriate, yet some phrases could be refined for naturalness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje (grounding)\", and \"memoria\". Explanations accompany most terms, aiding reader understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, with culturally suitable expressions such as \"consultor brillante\". Minor adaptations are needed (e.g., phrasing of “una cantidad muy grande de datos” could be more idiomatic) but overall the context is effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present; no significant information is omitted. The translation retains the dialogue structure and explanatory content, maintaining conciseness while avoiding redundancy.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and faithful to the original French script. It maintains clarity, uses appropriate terminology, and conveys the intended message without major omissions. A few phrasing adjustments would enhance naturalness, but overall the quality is high."
