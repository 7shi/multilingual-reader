    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows a logical sentence structure, but several sentences are somewhat awkward or too literal (e.g., “la IA no se perfecciona”). There are minor omissions of connective phrases that would aid flow. Overall, readers can grasp the content, but the clarity could be improved with smoother phrasing.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation often reads like a direct, word‑for‑word transfer rather than natural Spanish. Expressions such as “la IA no se perfecciona” or “una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado” feel clunky. Vocabulary is mostly correct, yet some terms could be more idiomatic (“ajuste fino” instead of “afinamiento”). The overall tone is understandable but not fully fluent.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly – pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, etc. However, there is inconsistent use of “afinamiento” vs. “ajuste fino”, and “Mémoire” is kept in French. The consistency and contextual explanation could be tightened.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original meaning but lacks some cultural adaptation. For example, keeping the French word “Mémoire” and the somewhat literal phrase “la IA no se perfecciona” might confuse native Spanish speakers. The overall intent is conveyed, but a few idiomatic adjustments would enhance readability.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The majority of the original content is present, including key concepts and examples. Minor details such as the nuance that ICL uses a temporary memory are preserved. The translation does not omit major information, though some redundant parts are slightly compressed. Overall, the content is complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the main ideas and many technical terms accurately. Nevertheless, it suffers from some literal phrasing, inconsistent terminology, and a few culturally unadapted expressions, which make it feel less natural to a native Spanish speaker. With a few revisions to smooth the language and unify terms, the quality would be significantly higher. Overall, it is a solid but improvable translation. 15/20 points are awarded for overall quality. 15/20 points for overall score. 15/20 overall score? Actually, the overall score is 15 out of 20 based on the weighted assessment of all criteria. 15/20. 15/20 overall score."
