    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to read and follows the logical flow of the original. Sentences are short and the technical concepts are introduced in a way that a lay reader can follow. Minor issues (e.g. “se envía una IA” instead of “se envía una IA recién creada”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly fluent, but there are several spots where the phrasing sounds slightly mechanical or unnatural to a native Spanish speaker. Examples include \"se envía una IA completamente nueva a la escuela\", \"El afinamiento, en cambio\", and the use of English abbreviations (ICL) without a Spanish equivalent. Overall, the text reads smoothly but could benefit from more natural idiomatic choices.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most key terms are correctly translated: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, etc. However, some terms were either left in French (\"ancrage\") or not fully localized (\"grounding\" as \"ancrage\" instead of \"anclaje\"). Consistency is generally good, but a few technical terms could be improved.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The tone is maintained and the cultural references are minimal, which works well for a general audience. The translation stays faithful to the original intent, but a few expressions feel more literal than culturally adapted (e.g. \"se envía una IA\" rather than a more natural Spanish construction). Overall, contextual adaptation is adequate.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All main ideas from the French script are preserved. No essential information was omitted, and the translation does not add extraneous content. Minor stylistic differences do not affect the content’s completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and mostly faithful to the source text. While it is readable and generally fluent, a few phrases could be polished for more naturalness and technical consistency. The overall quality is solid, making the content understandable to Spanish‑speaking listeners, though a second pass could refine some terminology and stylistic choices for a more professional polish. Overall, the translation scores well across all criteria but still has room for slight improvement in fluency and terminology consistency. The average score across the five criteria is 15.2 out of 20, indicating a high‑quality but not perfect translation. Minor adjustments would elevate the work to a top‑tier level, ensuring both linguistic elegance and precise technical communication for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The translation succeeds in delivering the intended message with clarity, but fine‑tuning specific lexical choices and idiomatic phrasing would further enhance its naturalness and cultural resonance."
