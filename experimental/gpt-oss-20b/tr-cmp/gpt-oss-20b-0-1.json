  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely intelligible and follows the conversational flow of the original. Sentences are short enough for most readers to parse, and the overall structure of dialogue is preserved. However, some phrases feel slightly clunky (“El aprendizaje en contexto es bachotaje”) and there are a few instances where the pronoun choice or article usage could be clarified (e.g., “Usted lo ha entendido todo” vs. the informal register used elsewhere). Overall, readers can understand the content with minor effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural to a native Spanish speaker, but a few awkward expressions and register inconsistencies reduce fluency. The switch from “tú” to “usted” is inconsistent and gives a slightly formal tone where a more casual tone would be appropriate. Phrases such as “El aprendizaje en contexto es bachotaje” and “La IA no se ajusta constantemente a sus conversaciones” are understandable but could be phrased more smoothly. Vocabulary choices are generally correct, but the overall flow would benefit from minor stylistic adjustments.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje en contexto” (ICL). The acronym ICL is retained in parentheses, which is acceptable for an audience familiar with English terminology. The translation consistently uses the chosen terms throughout, and where necessary, brief explanations are provided (e.g., “aprendizaje en contexto” vs. “ICL”). Minor improvement could involve explicitly translating the acronym or providing a short definition at first use, but overall terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator kept the original intent and sense, adapting expressions to Spanish while maintaining the friendly, informal tone. Cultural adaptation is adequate: idioms such as “enviar a un consultor brillante” fit Spanish context. However, some phrases could be further optimized for Spanish listeners, and the formal “Usted” could be replaced with “tú” for consistency. The adaptation is solid but not flawless.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original appear in the Spanish version: pretraining, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the “memory” feature. No substantive information is omitted. A few minor nuances, such as the exact wording of “grounding” or the name of the new feature “Memoria”, are preserved. The content remains concise and clear, with no unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is generally good, faithfully conveying the original content and technical concepts. Readability and terminology are strong, but fluency suffers from occasional register mismatches and slightly awkward phrasing. Contextual adaptation is adequate, though a more consistent informal tone would improve the overall flow. The translation retains all critical information, making it suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience familiar with AI terminology. With minor stylistic revisions—especially to unify pronouns and smooth out a few expressions—the text would reach a higher level of polish and readability. Overall, it is a competent translation that effectively serves its purpose for a Spanish‑speaking listener base. \n\nScore: 17/20"
