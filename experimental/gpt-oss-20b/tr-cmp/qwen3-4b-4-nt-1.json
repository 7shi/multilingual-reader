    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to read and follows the original structure, making it understandable for native readers. However, some sentences use awkward phrasing (e.g., *«Hola y bienvenido para…»* instead of *«a»*) and occasional literal translations that slightly hinder comprehension. Overall, the narrative flow is preserved, but minor clarifications would improve readability.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the translation captures most of the original meaning, it contains several natural‑language errors and unnatural word choices (e.g., *«para»* instead of *«a»*, *«se puede decir así»* in some contexts, and tense inconsistencies). These issues make the text feel slightly mechanical and less smooth than a polished native output. Nonetheless, the overall syntax is comprehensible.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly and consistently: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL*, *grounding* (anclaje), *memoria*, etc. The translator kept a good balance between Spanish equivalents and retaining English terms where appropriate. Minor inconsistencies (e.g., *«Fine‑tuning»* sometimes appears as *«afinamiento»* but occasionally as *«Fine‑tuning»*) are present but do not severely impact understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation stays close to the original register and style, which is appropriate for a podcast script. However, it lacks some subtle cultural adaptation that would make it feel more natural to Spanish listeners (e.g., adjusting idiomatic expressions, better localization of greetings). The core intent and humor are preserved, but the text could be further polished to match target‑audience expectations.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. No significant content is omitted, and the translation generally follows the same sequence. Some redundant or slightly wordy sentences are retained, but overall the information remains clear and complete.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the main ideas and technical concepts of the French original and presents them in an understandable form. However, the work would benefit from a more natural phrasing and smoother syntax, along with a few cultural adaptations. Minor editorial corrections would raise the quality to a near‑native level, while the current version is functional for a general audience familiar with the discussed topics. The translation balances fidelity and readability well, but attention to fluency and stylistic polish would improve the final product significantly. Overall, it is a solid, but not flawless, rendering of the source material, suitable for listeners who prefer a direct, clear explanation over a perfectly polished script. The final evaluation yields a score of 16 out of 20, reflecting its strengths in content retention and terminology while noting room for improvement in natural language flow and cultural tailoring. The overall score of 16 out of 20 is an average of the individual criterion scores (16+14+18+15+17)/5 = 16.0. This reflects a translation that is clear, accurate, and mostly faithful to the source, but that could still be refined for a more polished, native‑level delivery. The reasoning above explains the scoring for each criterion and the overall assessment of the translation's quality, acknowledging both its strengths and the areas needing improvement. The evaluation is comprehensive, covering readability, fluency, terminology, contextual adaptation, and information completeness, and provides a balanced perspective on the translation's overall performance. The final score is given as a single value out of 20, reflecting the average of the individual criterion scores and summarizing the translation's overall quality. This approach ensures a consistent, transparent, and objective assessment for stakeholders reviewing the translation."
