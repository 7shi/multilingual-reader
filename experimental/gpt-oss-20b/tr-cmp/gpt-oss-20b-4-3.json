  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version uses simple sentence structures and clear analogies (graduated student, consulting, bicycle) that make complex concepts accessible to general Spanish‑speaking audiences. However, occasional literal translations (e.g., “para la tarea que se debe hacer”) slightly hinder clarity. Overall, the content is comprehensible but could benefit from minor re‑phrasing.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural but contains a few awkward or incorrect expressions: missing accents (“masiva expansion”), unnatural phrasing (“para la tarea que se debe hacer”), and a few literal choices (“reentrenar la IA”). Despite these, the overall flow remains smooth and suitable for native readers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: preentrenamiento, afinamiento (ajuste fino), aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL. The translation preserves original acronyms and provides brief explanations where needed. No major terminological errors or omissions were found.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation respects the target culture: greetings, exclamations, and idiomatic expressions are appropriate. The original intent of explaining AI learning stages is preserved. Minor cultural nuances (e.g., use of “¡Hola!”) are correctly adapted, though some phrases could be polished for native familiarity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French source are present: pretraining, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory mechanisms, and the analogy between temporary and permanent knowledge. No substantive omissions; the translation occasionally condenses repetitive parts but remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and largely faithful to the source, successfully conveying complex AI concepts in accessible Spanish. Minor linguistic adjustments—particularly around accents and idiomatic phrasing—would improve fluency. Terminology is accurate and consistent, ensuring technical clarity for the target audience. Overall, the work demonstrates a good balance of fidelity, readability, and naturalness, making it suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI technology discussions.  The final overall score, based on the average of the five criteria, is 16 out of 20.  This reflects a high‑quality translation that could benefit from slight polishing for perfect fluency and idiomatic elegance.  The evaluation considered all relevant aspects—readability, fluency, terminology, contextual adaptation, and information completeness—to arrive at this comprehensive assessment.  Score: 16/20."
