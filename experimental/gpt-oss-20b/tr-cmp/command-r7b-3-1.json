    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely comprehensible and follows the dialogue structure of the original. Sentences are generally coherent and the main ideas are conveyed. However, there are moments where the wording is awkward or slightly confusing (e.g., \"El aprendizaje en contexto es como el bachillerato para un examen\" misrepresents the original meaning of *cramming*). These issues slightly impede smooth understanding for a native reader.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains several non‑native or incorrect word choices such as \"afinomamiento\", \"perfilar\", and the inconsistent use of hyphens in \"pre‑entrenamiento\" vs. \"preentrenamiento\". These create a stilted feel. The overall flow is understandable but could benefit from smoother phrasing and more idiomatic expressions.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly translated: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning* (though left in English in one spot), *in‑context learning*, *grounding* (*ancraje*). However, the invented term \"afinomamiento\" is incorrect, and the phrase \"entrenamiento previo\" could be replaced with the more common \"pre‑entrenamiento\" for consistency. The terminology remains largely clear for the target audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to adapt cultural references, but some adaptations are inaccurate (e.g., using \"bachillerato\" to translate *cramming*). The dialogue keeps the informal tone, but the mix of English and Spanish terms (e.g., keeping *fine‑tuning* in English) could confuse readers. Overall, the intent is preserved but some contextual choices need refinement.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No significant content is omitted. The addition of small clarifications (e.g., \"Entendido\") does not detract from the message. The translation is concise enough to maintain clarity.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the main concepts and dialogue structure of the original French text, but it suffers from several non‑native word choices, inconsistent terminology, and some cultural misinterpretations. These issues slightly lower its fluency and precision. With a few adjustments—especially correcting \"afinomamiento\" to \"ajuste fino\", refining the cramming analogy, and standardizing the use of *pre‑entrenamiento*—the translation would be strong and reader‑friendly."
