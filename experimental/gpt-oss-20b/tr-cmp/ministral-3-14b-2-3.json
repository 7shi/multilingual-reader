  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable but contains several disjointed sentences and unexplained gaps (e.g., stray \"translation\" placeholders).  Readers can follow the main ideas, yet the occasional abrupt transitions and missing context reduce overall clarity.  The average score is 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is not entirely smooth; many sentences feel awkward or incomplete, and the presence of untranslated fragments and English terms (e.g., \"ICL\") interrupts the flow.  A native speaker would find the prose somewhat choppy, meriting a score of 10/20.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms such as \"entrenamiento previo\", \"ajuste fino\" and \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" are correctly rendered.  However, terms like \"grounding\" were rendered as \"vinculación a datos concretos\", which is not the standard Spanish equivalent and leads to inconsistency.  Additionally, some essential terms (e.g., \"prompt\") are commented on rather than simply translated.  This earns a 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the overall intent but neglects some cultural nuances; for instance, the metaphor of a \"consultor brillante\" is plausible, yet the script’s humor and casual tone are somewhat lost.  The presence of literal, non‑localized expressions lowers the score to 11/20.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Significant content is missing or garbled (e.g., the lines containing \"translation\" placeholders, incomplete exchanges, and omitted explanations of concepts like \"ICL\").  These omissions and the inclusion of meta‑comments reduce the completeness to 8/20.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation shows a basic grasp of the source material but is marred by numerous inaccuracies, omissions, and stylistic issues.  It is not ready for publication without substantial revision to ensure clarity, correctness, and natural flow in Spanish."
