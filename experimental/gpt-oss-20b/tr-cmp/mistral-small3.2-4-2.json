  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are short, most complex concepts are broken into simple clauses, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue, making it comprehensible for native readers.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation feels mostly natural, but there are a few awkward phrases such as \"la IA se apoya en bases extremadamente sólidas\" and repeated wordings like \"le proporciona los documentos\". Some idiomatic choices could be smoother, affecting overall fluency slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly correctly rendered (e.g., \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\"). Minor inconsistencies like using \"ajuste\" instead of \"ajuste fino\" are present but do not hinder understanding.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the intent and conversational tone of the original. Cultural references are appropriately adapted for Spanish-speaking listeners, and the dialogue feels natural within the podcast context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No critical information is omitted, and the dialogue remains concise while maintaining clarity.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of both the content and the target language, delivering clear and mostly natural dialogue. Minor linguistic refinements would improve fluency and consistency, but overall it is a competent rendering suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience listening to a tech podcast. The average score reflects this quality level, with room for polishing some phrasing and terminology consistency. Overall, it is an effective translation that successfully conveys the original message while maintaining an engaging conversational style for listeners. The small issues noted are typical of a near-final draft and do not detract significantly from the overall quality of the translation. The final score reflects a near‑perfect translation with minor room for improvement in fluency and consistency of terminology. This makes it suitable for immediate use with only light editing required for publication or broadcast."
