    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable; sentence structures are generally clear, and the dialogue follows the original's conversational flow. However, some phrases (e.g., “lo has entendido perfectamente”) feel slightly abrupt and could be smoothed out for better readability. 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation reads naturally for a Spanish speaker, but there are a few awkward or slightly literal constructions (“le proporcionamos la información necesaria”, “lo has entendido perfectamente”). Minor syntactic adjustments would improve the flow. 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre-entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto* and *aprendizaje en contexto* are correctly rendered. The translation of *grounding* as *fundamentación* is understandable but not the most common choice; consistency could be improved by using *anclaje* or *conexión*. 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The content is culturally appropriate overall, but the title inconsistency (using “Tecno Revelada” at the start and “Tech Éclair” at the end) could confuse listeners. The Spanish phrasing is suitable for a general audience, but the title inconsistency slightly detracts from the adaptation quality. 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the original are present; no significant omissions. The translation retains the explanatory details and dialogue structure, keeping the content concise yet thorough. 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation delivers the core content accurately and is largely intelligible for native speakers. Minor issues with fluency, terminology consistency, and a title mismatch are the main drawbacks. Overall, it is a solid translation that effectively conveys the original intent while remaining accessible to a Spanish-speaking audience. 16/20."
