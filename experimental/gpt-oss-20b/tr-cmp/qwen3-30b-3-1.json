  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to read and follows a logical sentence structure. Most explanations of complex concepts are clear and the conversational tone is maintained. The only stumbling block is the use of the French verb “bachoter” instead of a Spanish equivalent, which may confuse some readers, but overall comprehension remains high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for native Spanish speakers and uses contemporary vocabulary. Minor syntactic quirks exist – for example, “parte de un contexto vacío” could be phrased more idiomatically as “partes de un contexto vacío” – but these do not hinder overall fluency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “refinamiento”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “anclaje” for grounding, etc. The only inconsistency is the misuse of “bachoter” where a Spanish phrase such as “estudiar de memoria” would be expected.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent and tone are preserved, and cultural references are adapted appropriately (e.g., using “Tech Relámpago” for the show’s name). The translation remains faithful to the French script while being accessible to a Spanish-speaking audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the original French is present in the Spanish version, including the dialogue, explanations, and examples. No substantive information was omitted, and the overall length is comparable, maintaining concision.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and mostly accurate, capturing the meaning, tone, and technical nuance of the original French script. Minor issues such as the inadvertent inclusion of a French verb and some slightly awkward phrasing slightly reduce its overall polish, but the text remains clear, fluent, and well adapted to a Spanish-speaking audience. With a few small corrections, it could be considered a high‑quality translation."
