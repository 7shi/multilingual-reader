  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is presented as a long list of multiple alternative translations, each prefaced by *Versión mejorada*, *Alternativas*, etc. While individual sentences are understandable, the sheer volume of redundant options and frequent switching between them make it hard for a reader to follow the intended flow of the podcast script. The structure is therefore confusing and detracts from a smooth reading experience. This lowers overall readability to 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the Spanish sentences read naturally and employ appropriate idiomatic expressions (“¿O sea?”, “como si fuera la primera vez”). However, the text contains occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., *“se le olvida lo que habías dicho”* vs. *“se le olvida todo lo que dijiste”*), some tense inconsistencies, and occasional leftover French fragments (*“C’est tout à fait ça”*). Overall the fluency is good but not perfect, earning a 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *entrenamiento previo*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por contexto*, *memoria temporal* are consistently used, and the translator frequently provides clarifications when a term might be unfamiliar (e.g., explaining *finetuning*). There are a few minor inconsistencies (mixing *finetuning* with *ajuste fino*) but they are generally coherent. The terminology handling is therefore solid, deserving 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., *bachotage* explained, “consultor temporal vs. experto permanente” phrasing). The dialogue flow is maintained and the Spanish audience’s cultural context is considered. Minor issues arise from retained French expressions and occasional over‑literal translations, but the overall adaptation is strong: 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original—pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory, and the consultant vs. expert analogy—are present in the translation. However, the proliferation of alternative versions introduces redundancy and some repetitive explanations, slightly diluting conciseness. No major information is omitted, so the completeness score is 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates strong technical competence and good adaptation to Spanish culture, but the format—an extensive collection of alternative phrasings—hurts readability and coherence. The resulting text is understandable and fluent for native readers, yet the overall structure feels fragmented, which reduces the overall quality. With moderate improvements in organization and consistency, the translation could reach higher marks across all criteria. The average score is 13.4/20, indicating that the translation is competent but leaves room for refinement, particularly in streamlining the content and ensuring a single, cohesive rendition."
