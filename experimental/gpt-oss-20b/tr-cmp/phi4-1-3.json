  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and follows the same logical flow as the original. Sentences are mostly concise, and complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and ICL are explained in a way that a general audience can grasp. However, a few long, compound sentences make the text slightly harder to read, and the occasional literal translation of idiomatic French phrasing slightly reduces clarity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds largely natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The vocabulary choice is contemporary, and most grammatical structures are correct. Still, there are minor awkwardnesses: a French phrase ('C’est tout à fait ça.') remains in the middle of a Spanish sentence, some plural forms are inconsistent ('informaciones' vs 'información'), and the phrasing of certain comments could be more idiomatic. These issues lower overall fluency a bit.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are consistently translated and appropriate for a general tech‑interested audience. Minor variations (e.g., using \"memoria a corto plazo\" instead of \"ventana de contexto\") are acceptable. Overall, terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and purpose. Cultural adaptation is generally adequate: references to a 'consultant' instead of a 'professor' make sense in the Spanish context. However, a few expressions could be better localized (e.g., 'Lo has entendido todo' could be 'Lo has comprendido por completo'), and the abrupt inclusion of a French phrase slightly undermines the local feel. The overall adaptation is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential points from the French original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, short‑term memory, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No critical details are omitted. The translation includes explanations for potentially confusing concepts and does not add unnecessary redundancy. The only minor issue is the stray French phrase, which does not affect comprehension but is an error in completeness of translation.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid overall. It accurately conveys the technical content and maintains the conversational tone of the original. Minor errors such as the leftover French phrase and some slightly awkward phrasing reduce the polish but do not impede understanding. With a few edits for naturalness and consistency, the translation would reach a higher level of quality.\n\nAverage score: 16.6 → 17/20."
