  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text follows a clear, conversational structure that is easy for Spanish‑speaking listeners to follow. Technical ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in plain language, with analogies that aid comprehension. Some minor punctuation choices (e.g., missing accent on *¿Entonces es una astucia?*) slightly interrupt flow, but overall the readability is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences read naturally and the vocabulary is appropriate. However, a few phrases feel slightly mechanical or literal (*Lo han entendido todo*, *¿Entonces es una astucia?*, *La IA no es constantemente refinada*) and could be smoother. There are also minor issues with article use and word order that are noticeable to native readers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are translated correctly (*preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *grounding* → *anclaje*, *memoria*). The translator consistently uses the same terms throughout, and no jargon is omitted. Minor alternative choices could improve precision, but overall terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original tone and conversational style suitable for a podcast. Cultural references are neutral and do not create confusion. The adaptation is faithful to the intended audience and maintains the informal, friendly register. Some expressions could be slightly more idiomatic, but they do not hinder understanding.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains all essential information from the French source, including the sequence of concepts and the illustrative analogies. No substantive content is omitted. There is a minor repetition of *El modelo en sí mismo no aprende…*, but it is not excessive. Overall, the translation is complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is generally accurate and readable, with clear explanations of technical concepts. It preserves the original’s conversational tone and structure, making it suitable for a podcast audience. A few sentences could be polished for smoother native fluency, but these are minor compared to the overall quality. The translation succeeds in conveying the full meaning of the source text while staying accessible to Spanish listeners. The overall score reflects a strong, well‑executed translation with room for minor refinement in style and idiomatic phrasing. The translation would be fully acceptable for publication or broadcast after minor edits for naturalness and consistency in article usage and punctuation."
