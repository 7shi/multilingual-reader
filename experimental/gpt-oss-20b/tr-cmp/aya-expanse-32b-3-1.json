  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the flow of the original French script. However, the presence of stray code‑block markers (``json``) and some awkward phrasing (e.g., *« Ella lee una cantidad masiva de datos en Internet… »*, *« aprender la lengua »*) make parts of the text feel interrupted and slightly confusing. The overall narrative is clear, but these small issues lower readability.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While many sentences read smoothly, several expressions feel unnatural for native Spanish speakers: *« ¡Y soy Luc! »*, *« aprender la lengua »*, *« se insertan automáticamente estos fragmentos en el prompt, en segundo plano »*. The abrupt use of English abbreviations (ICL, GPT) and inconsistent punctuation also disrupt the flow. The translation would benefit from more idiomatic wording and a more consistent style.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *grounding* are correctly rendered and mostly consistent. Minor issues: *ICL* is expanded as *Aprendizaje en Contexto* but the English abbreviation is left in parentheses, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the acronym. Overall, terminology handling is solid but could be tightened.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the overall intent and structure, but there are a few cultural mismatches: the show title is changed to *« Tecnología al Instante »* instead of a direct adaptation of *Tech Éclair*, and the opening greetings (*¡Hola…!* and *¡Y soy Luc!*) feel less formal than the original. These choices slightly alter the tone but do not distort meaning. Minor adjustments could improve cultural resonance.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas and dialogues from the French source are present in the Spanish version. The translation includes the same concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the memory feature. Redundancy is largely avoided, although the stray code markers are extraneous. The content is complete and concise.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely faithful to the original French text and conveys the intended message. However, it is marred by formatting artefacts, occasional unnatural phrasing, and minor terminology inconsistencies. With some polishing—removing the stray code markers, smoothing out idiomatic expressions, and ensuring consistent use of technical terms—the translation could achieve a higher level of quality and naturalness for Spanish‑speaking audiences."
