  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains many fragmented sentences, missing punctuation, and occasional untranslated fragments (e.g., “C’est une excellente remarque”). Readers will struggle to follow the flow; many sections are incomprehensible or awkwardly constructed. Overall, readability is quite low.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation frequently mixes languages (French fragments in Spanish, a few English sentences). The word order and some expressions are unnatural for native Spanish speakers. The overall rhythm and smoothness are compromised. Fluency is poor.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Some technical terms are translated correctly (“ajuste fino”, “ventana de contexto”), but others are missing or rendered in English (“in-context learning”). There is no consistent terminology strategy, and the lack of explanations for terms that could be confusing to non‑expert listeners reduces clarity. Terminology handling is mediocre.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator did not adequately adapt cultural references or idiomatic expressions. Several lines are literally carried over from French or left untranslated, and the context of the conversation (e.g., the role of the “consultant”) is not consistently conveyed. The adaptation to Spanish‑speaking audiences is therefore weak.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are omitted or incomplete. Key explanatory segments are missing (e.g., the detailed description of ICL), and some speaker turns are misattributed. The final message is significantly truncated. The translation lacks completeness.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation falls short on several fronts: readability, fluency, consistency of terminology, and completeness. The text contains numerous untranslated fragments, misplaced speaker labels, and unnatural phrasing that collectively make it difficult for a Spanish‑speaking audience to understand the original intent. Significant revision is needed to produce a clear, faithful, and natural Spanish version of the podcast transcript. The overall quality of the translation is poor and would not meet professional standards for a finished product without substantial editing and correction. The overall score reflects the need for comprehensive re‑translation and quality checks before release to listeners. The translation does not yet convey the original message effectively or naturally to the target audience. It requires a full rewrite to align with the intended tone, clarity, and technical accuracy of the source material. The low score indicates that many errors and omissions exist and should be addressed immediately to meet acceptable standards for a professional translation service. In short, the current version is unusable as a finished product and would likely cause confusion or misinterpretation among listeners. The translation needs to be fully re‑worked to achieve a reliable, professional outcome that meets the expectations of both the source material and the target audience. The current evaluation is based on a comprehensive analysis of the main evaluation criteria, and the results are consistent across the board, revealing a consistent pattern of poor translation quality that would not satisfy professional clients or end users."
