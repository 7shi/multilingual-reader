  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly easy to understand. Sentences flow logically, and the speaker’s back‑and‑forth dialogue is preserved. Minor omissions of articles or prepositions (e.g., \"La IA hace de mismo\" instead of \"la IA hace lo mismo\") do not obscure meaning, so the readability score is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds generally natural, but several phrases feel slightly literal or awkward. Examples include \"el ajuste fino (optimizarlo)\" and \"Mire más bien\". Some punctuation and article usage are off. These quirks lower the fluency, but overall the text remains smooth enough for native speakers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\". The only real issue is the parenthetical \"optimizarlo\", which is not a standard term in Spanish. Terminology is consistent throughout, so the score is fairly high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the conversational tone and cultural references suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Expressions like \"consultor brillante\" and the analogy with a bicycle are culturally apt. The only minor slip is the literal translation of some idioms, but overall the adaptation is good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant information is omitted; the dialogue covers all points from the original French script. The only potential loss is the small typo in \"La IA hace de mismo\", which does not alter the conveyed meaning. Redundancy is minimal, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and conveys the original content well. It contains a few minor grammatical and lexical inaccuracies that could be cleaned up with proofreading, but it remains clear, natural, and technically accurate for a native audience. With slight polishing, it would reach near‑perfect quality.\n\nScore: 17.8 (rounded to 18) overall out of 20.  (Readability 18, Fluency 16, Terminology 17, Contextual Adaptation 18, Information Completeness 19)."
