  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to read and the logical flow of the original dialogue is preserved. Long sentences are occasionally hard to parse, but the meaning is still clear to a native reader.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural. Some minor awkward expressions appear (e.g., “Lo has comprendido todo.”, “una astucia”) and a few prepositions feel slightly off, but overall the flow is smooth and contemporary vocabulary is used appropriately.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, etc. Explanations accompany unfamiliar concepts, and the terminology matches the target audience’s level.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original’s intent and tone. Cultural references are adapted appropriately and no major misunderstandings arise. Minor opportunities to fine‑tune idiomatic phrasing were missed, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present. No significant omissions are evident. A few subtle nuances (e.g., the exact phrasing of “astuce” as “trick”) are slightly altered, but the overall information is complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation demonstrates strong fidelity to the original French text, with clear and accurate terminology and a generally natural tone. Minor adjustments to phrasing and flow would elevate it to a flawless translation, but it already communicates the content effectively for Spanish‑speaking listeners."
