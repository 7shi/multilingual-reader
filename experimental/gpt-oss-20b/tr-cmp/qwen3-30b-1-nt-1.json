  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is mostly easy to follow. Sentence structures are clear and the flow mirrors the original. A few sentences are long or slightly clunky, but overall the text is comprehensible to a native speaker.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly in most places, but there are a handful of awkward phrasings (e.g., \"Es todo a la perfección\", \"La IA no se refina constantemente a través de sus conversaciones\"). Overall, the language feels natural, but these moments lower the fluency slightly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pré-entraînement\" → \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"fine-tuning\" → \"ajuste fino\", \"apprentissage par transfert\" → \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", etc. The terminology is consistent and understandable. Minor issues: use of \"informaciones\" instead of singular \"información\".",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the cultural context of Spanish‑speaking audiences and keeps idiomatic expressions. The meaning and intent of the original are preserved, though some idiomatic choices (e.g., \"Es todo a la perfección\") feel slightly unnatural. Overall adaptation is good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant content is omitted. All key points are present, and the translation adds no extraneous information. The only minor issue is a slightly inconsistent use of the singular/plural in \"informaciones\", but this does not affect understanding.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source text and the target language. It preserves the main ideas and technical terminology with minor issues in fluency and some stylistic choices that could be refined. The overall quality is high, with clear readability and faithful content delivery, making it suitable for native Spanish‑speaking listeners of a technical podcast."
