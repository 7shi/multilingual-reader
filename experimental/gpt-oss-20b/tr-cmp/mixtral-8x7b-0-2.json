  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely understandable for native speakers. Sentence structures mirror the original conversational tone and the explanations of technical concepts are clear. Minor punctuation omissions (e.g., missing hyphen in \"preentrenamiento\") do not impede comprehension but slightly affect readability.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text flows well overall, but there are noticeable errors that disrupt naturalness. \"ajuste fine\" should be \"ajuste fino\", and capitalising \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\" is unconventional. Some phrases feel literal (e.g., \"la IA no ha 'olvidado' en el sentido humano de la palabra\") but are still intelligible.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered (e.g., \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"contextual\"), yet inconsistencies appear: \"ajuste fine\" (typo), missing accent on \"contexto\" in the capitalised form, and omission of the abbreviation ICL. Overall, terminology is adequate but not fully consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and adapts idiomatic expressions to Spanish (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", \"proyecto en curso\"). Cultural references are minimal and appropriately handled. Minor mismatches in formality levels are negligible.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue and key points from the original French transcript are preserved. No significant content is omitted, and the translation does not add extraneous information. Redundancy is minimal, and the overall structure remains faithful to the source.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and largely faithful to the source material. It conveys the original meaning and conversational tone effectively, though a few typographical and terminology errors reduce its polish. With minor corrections, it would meet high standards for a native‑Spanish audience in a technical podcast context. The main issues are isolated mistakes rather than systemic flaws, so the overall quality is good but not perfect. A refined version would address the typo in \"ajuste fine\", standardise the use of capitalisation, and ensure consistent hyphenation and accentuation throughout the text. The resulting piece would read smoothly, appear natural to Spanish speakers, and provide clear, accurate technical explanations as intended by the original French script."
