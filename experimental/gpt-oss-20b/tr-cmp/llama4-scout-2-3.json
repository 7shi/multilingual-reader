  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logical and most technical concepts are explained in a straightforward manner. Minor issues arise from some long sentences and slightly awkward phrasing, but overall readers can comprehend the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly natural, but a few constructions feel literal or verbose (e.g., \"Se inserta automáticamente ... entre bastidores\"). The use of parenthetical explanations and occasional English terms reduces the smoothness for native Spanish speakers. Overall, it reads well but could be tightened for smoother flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled appropriately: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\". Consistency is good, though the dual use of \"pre-entrenamiento\" and \"entrenamiento previo\" could be unified. Explanations are provided when necessary.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references well and retains the conversational tone suitable for a podcast script. Minor meta‑commentary is added (e.g., the note about terminology usage) which is not harmful but slightly off‑track. Overall, intent and purpose are effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the original are present; no significant omissions. Some additional explanatory notes are included, and redundancy is largely avoided. The script remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "This Spanish translation is a solid, comprehensible adaptation of the original French podcast script. It successfully conveys the core concepts and conversational style, though a few stylistic refinements could enhance naturalness. The translation retains technical accuracy and contextual relevance, making it suitable for Spanish‑speaking audiences with a basic understanding of AI terminology. Minor polishing of sentence structure and consistency would elevate the quality to near‑flawless level, but overall it meets high standards of translation quality for the target demographic. The final rating reflects its strong performance while acknowledging small room for improvement in fluency and uniform terminology usage. Overall score: 17/20. (Average of individual criterion scores.)"
