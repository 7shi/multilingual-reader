  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is fragmented, contains repeated lines, missing punctuation, and many incomplete or nonsensical sentences (e.g., \"Luc: Exactement\" mixed with Spanish). As a result, a native Spanish speaker would struggle to follow the flow of the conversation or grasp the technical concepts. Therefore the readability score is low.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation suffers from awkward phrasing, incorrect verb conjugations, and the insertion of French words (e.g., \"Exactement\", \"finetuning\") that do not belong to the Spanish target text. Sentences are often broken or duplicated. Overall, the text does not read smoothly for a Spanish audience, warranting a low fluency score.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Some technical terms are rendered correctly (e.g., \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\"), but many others are inconsistent or missing (e.g., \"finetuning\" is left as an English word, \"contextual learning\" is translated incorrectly). There is no consistent terminology strategy and explanatory notes are absent where terms might be unfamiliar to listeners. This yields a modest score.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to adapt the original dialogue to a Spanish-speaking context. Cultural references, idioms, and the flow of conversation are not preserved, and the speaker turns are confused. This detracts from the clarity and intent of the original, leading to a low score.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Significant portions of the original French script are omitted or repeated, and many explanatory passages are missing. The Spanish version does not cover all key ideas such as the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, or the nature of memory features. Consequently, the information completeness is poor.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely unusable in its current form. It contains many errors, repeated fragments, and inconsistent terminology, making it difficult for Spanish-speaking listeners to understand the discussion. A thorough rewrite with careful proofreading and consistent technical language is required to meet professional standards."
