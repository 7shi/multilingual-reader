  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to read and follows a logical sentence structure that mirrors the original French dialogue. Most technical concepts are explained in a straightforward manner. Some minor phrasing could be clearer (e.g., \"para darle una cultura general\" could be phrased as \"para adquirir una base de conocimientos generales\"), but overall readers can grasp the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly natural for a Spanish-speaking audience. However, a few expressions feel slightly awkward or literal, such as \"El refinamiento… es ahí donde interviene el « aprendizaje por transferencia »?\" where the question mark placement and ellipsis can break the flow. Additionally, the repeated use of \"IA\" as both singular and plural can sound a bit jarring. These issues lower the overall fluency slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are appropriately translated and consistent: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine-tuning\" → \"refinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje contextual\", \"anclaje\" for grounding. The translations align with common Spanish usage in the AI field, and where needed, explanations are provided. Minor inconsistencies such as the use of \"IA\" vs. \"IAs\" do not significantly affect comprehension.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references remain neutral and suitable for Spanish-speaking audiences. Adaptations such as using \"consultor\" for the consultant analogy fit the target culture. The only slight adjustment that could improve cultural resonance would be to use \"IA\" as a collective noun consistently, but this is a minor point.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted, and redundant content is largely avoided. The translation maintains the dialogue structure, keeping the script concise and clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is strong overall, faithfully conveying the content, terminology, and intent of the original French script. Minor fluency issues and occasional awkward phrasing prevent a perfect score, but the piece remains clear, accurate, and well-adapted to Spanish-speaking listeners. With a few stylistic refinements, it would reach top-tier quality.  Overall score: 86/100 (average 17.2/20)."
