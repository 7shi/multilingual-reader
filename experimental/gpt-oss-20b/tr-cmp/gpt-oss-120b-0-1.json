  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the structure of the dialogue is logical. The translation keeps the conversational tone and explains technical concepts in a straightforward way. Minor long sentences may slightly reduce readability but overall it remains clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The language is mostly natural for native speakers. Some small awkwardness occurs, e.g., \"Lo has entendido todo\" could be \"Lo has entendido\" and the use of \"lo tiene\" in one spot is slightly informal. Grammar is correct and vocabulary is contemporary, so fluency is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"anclaje\" are correctly translated and consistently used. The translation accurately captures the meaning of the original terms and provides enough context for readers unfamiliar with the concepts.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal podcast vibe and adapts expressions to Spanish-speaking audiences (e.g., \"Vamos a levantar el velo\"). Cultural references are suitable and the translation avoids literal, stilted wording. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve naturalness but overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is present. No key details are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary repetition. The content is concise and clear, maintaining the original meaning throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the original French dialogue while maintaining natural flow and appropriate technical terminology. Small fluency issues are present but do not impede comprehension. Overall, the translation is clear, accurate, and well‑adapted to a Spanish‑speaking audience. The translation demonstrates a good balance between literal fidelity and natural expression, making it suitable for listeners of the podcast or readers of the transcript.\n\nScore out of 20: 18 (average of individual criteria)."
