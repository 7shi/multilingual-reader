  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated dialogue is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in a conversational tone. Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., a missing period after some lines) do not hinder comprehension, but the overall structure is clear and coherent for native Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally in Spanish. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary. There are a few slightly awkward or non‑idiomatic phrases – for example, ‘aprenderá el francés a una velocidad increíble’ could be ‘aprende el francés a una velocidad increíble’ – and the capitalization of ‘Aprendizaje en Contexto’ is unnecessary. Overall, the translation sounds smooth and is suitable for a general audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: 'preentrenamiento', 'ajuste fino', 'aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)', 'anclaje' (grounding), and 'memoria a corto plazo' are all accurate and consistently used. The translation provides brief explanations where needed, maintaining clarity for readers who may not be familiar with the concepts.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational style. Cultural references are neutral and adapted appropriately for Spanish-speaking listeners. The dialogue feels natural in a podcast setting, with subtle adjustments that suit the target audience’s expectations.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All original lines are present, and no substantive information is omitted. The translation includes the same explanations, examples, and rhetorical devices as the French source. Redundancy is minimal and the content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, maintaining the original dialogue’s clarity, tone, and technical accuracy. Minor stylistic tweaks would improve naturalness, but the current version is fully comprehensible and faithful to the source text."
