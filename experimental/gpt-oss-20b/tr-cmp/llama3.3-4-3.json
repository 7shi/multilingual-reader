  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable, especially for a tech‑savvy audience. However, several sentences are awkwardly constructed (e.g., *«El aprendizaje en contexto es como estudiar a última hora.」*), and some short fragments lack proper context, which can momentarily confuse the reader. Overall, the flow is acceptable but not optimal.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most vocabulary is correct, the text contains numerous unnatural turns and inconsistent capitalization (e.g., *«Aprendizaje en Contexto»* vs *«aprendizaje en contexto»*). Additionally, the inclusion of explanatory remarks such as *«This improved translation aims to maintain the original meaning...」* breaks the narrative flow. The overall tone feels partly literal and partly colloquial, reducing smoothness.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms like *«pre‑entrenamiento», «ajuste fino», «aprendizaje por transferencia»* are correctly rendered. Nevertheless, *«Aprendizaje de Características Inteligentes»* is a mistranslation of ICL, and the use of *«anclaje»* is acceptable but could be more precise. Inconsistencies in term usage and some missing parenthetical clarifications reduce overall accuracy.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely follows the original intent, preserving the informal podcast style. However, it lacks deeper cultural adaptation; some idiomatic expressions (e.g., *«la IA es como un joven graduado…」*) could be smoother. The speaker names remain unchanged, which is appropriate, but occasional literal phrasing limits engagement with a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All main points are present, but the text includes extraneous meta‑comments and a significant terminology error (*«Aprendizaje de Características Inteligentes»*). Minor omissions in explanation (e.g., the precise mechanism of memory‑augmentation features) slightly reduce completeness, but the core content remains intact.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material and preserves most of the technical content. However, it suffers from several issues: unnatural phrasing, inconsistent capitalization, a major terminology mistake, and the accidental insertion of explanatory commentary. A careful revision—especially focusing on idiomatic fluency and accurate term usage—would greatly improve clarity and reader engagement. Overall, it is a good draft that needs polishing to meet professional quality standards for a Spanish‑language podcast transcript."
