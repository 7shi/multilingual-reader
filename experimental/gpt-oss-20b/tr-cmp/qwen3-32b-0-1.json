  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely easy to read and follows a logical sentence structure.  Complex ideas such as pre‑training and fine‑tuning are explained in a straightforward way.  Minor awkwardness appears in phrases like *Lo tiene todo claro*, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural to a Spanish‑speaking audience.  Most expressions flow smoothly, but a few constructions (e.g., *Lo tiene todo claro*, *una forma astuta de aprendizaje contextual automatizado*) feel slightly contrived.  Vocabulary is contemporary and appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered (*pre‑entrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *anclaje*).  The translator keeps the original meaning intact and explains concepts when necessary, with no significant omissions.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation retains the original intent and tone.  Cultural references are minimal, and the dialogue feels natural for Spanish listeners.  A few minor style tweaks could improve idiomatic flow, but the overall message is preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the original is present.  No key points are omitted, and the translation does not add extraneous information.  The structure is concise and clear.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of very high quality.  It faithfully conveys the technical explanations, maintains a conversational tone, and keeps the content comprehensive.  Small stylistic refinements would elevate it to perfection, but as it stands it is ready for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
