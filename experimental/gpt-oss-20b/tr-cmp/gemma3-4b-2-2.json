  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is fragmented and contains numerous typographical errors (e.g., repeated curly brackets, misplaced punctuation). Sentences are often incomplete or abruptly cut, which hampers comprehension. While the basic storyline can be followed, the lack of clear structure and frequent formatting glitches make it difficult for a native reader to read smoothly.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural phrases (“una gran cantidad de información”), awkward word choices (“informaciones que se proporcionan”), and inconsistent use of verb tenses. Several sentences read like literal word‑for‑word translations, and some clauses are missing or duplicated, resulting in a stilted and sometimes nonsensical flow.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento* and *ajuste fino* are correctly used, but others are mishandled or omitted. For instance, *In‑Context Learning* is introduced as “aprendizaje en contexto” but later the abbreviation “ICL” is left unexplained. The term *grounding* is translated as “anclaje”, which is acceptable, yet the explanation that follows is garbled. Consistency is lacking, and some technical concepts are left unelaborated.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally preserves the dialogue format and the overall intent, but cultural nuances and idiomatic expressions are not fully adapted. The conversational tone of the original is partially maintained, yet the excessive repetition and literal phrasing dilute the naturalness expected by Spanish‑speaking audiences.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original text are missing or corrupted (e.g., sentences ending abruptly, repeated bracketed fragments). Key explanations about fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context memory are truncated or repeated, leading to significant gaps in the conveyed information.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation attempts to render the French source into Spanish, but it suffers from numerous structural, lexical, and typographical issues. The text is fragmented, often unreadable, and incomplete, resulting in a low overall quality. Substantial revision is required to meet a standard of clear, fluent, and accurate translation."
