  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow. The sentence structure mirrors the original, and explanations of complex concepts such as pre‑training and in‑context learning are clear. Minor issues—like the awkward “Lo han entendido todo” and the slight inconsistency between “aprendizaje en contexto” and “aprender en contexto”—do not prevent comprehension but slightly reduce readability.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly overall, with appropriate vocabulary and contemporary phrasing. However, there are small grammatical errors (e.g., “Lo han entendido todo” should be “Lo has entendido todo”) and occasional literal wording that feels slightly unnatural to native speakers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: pre‑training → preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning → ajuste fino, transfer learning → aprendizaje por transferencia, context window → ventana de contexto, in‑context learning → aprendizaje en contexto. The choice of “anclaje” for grounding is acceptable, though not the most common. Minor inconsistencies in the usage of “aprender en contexto” vs. “aprendizaje en contexto” exist but do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the intent and tone of the original French podcast script, adapting idiomatic expressions to Spanish where appropriate. Cultural nuances are respected, and the dialogue remains engaging. The small mis‑translation “Lo han entendido todo” slightly undermines adaptation but is otherwise effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All sentences from the original are present; no significant information is omitted. The translation keeps the same structure and content, ensuring that listeners receive the full context and details of the discussion.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and faithful to the original, with only minor linguistic glitches that do not obscure meaning. The technical terminology is accurate, the style is conversational, and the information remains intact. With a few corrections to grammatical phrasing, this would be an excellent final version for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Overall quality is high, reflecting a professional level of translation skill.\n\nOverall score: 17.5/20.0 (average of individual scores)."
