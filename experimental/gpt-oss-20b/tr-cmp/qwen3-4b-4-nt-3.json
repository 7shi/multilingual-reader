    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely intelligible and follows a logical flow. However, some sentences are a bit heavy and the repeated use of “por lo tanto” can feel redundant. Minor punctuation issues also hinder a smooth read.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly natural, but there are several awkward choices: the preposition “para” instead of “a” in the opening line, the phrasing “por lo tanto” repeated unnecessarily, and the phrase “aprovechando la ‘MÉMORES’ (Memoria)” which sounds clunky. Overall, the text feels like a draft rather than polished prose.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding → anclaje, ICL, etc. The parenthetical English terms (fine‑tuning, ICL) are included but may confuse a Spanish‑only audience. Consistency is good, though some terms could have been fully translated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and structure, but cultural adaptation is minimal. The phrase “Hola y bienvenido para” is incorrect, and some expressions feel too literal. Minor adjustments would make it more idiomatic for Spanish listeners.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present; no substantive information is omitted. Redundancy is acceptable given the dialogue format, and no extra content is added.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version is understandable and largely faithful to the source, but a few grammatical slips, awkward prepositions, and lingering English terms reduce its naturalness. With a bit of polishing—especially around prepositions, repetition, and consistent terminology—the translation would read more smoothly and professionally for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
