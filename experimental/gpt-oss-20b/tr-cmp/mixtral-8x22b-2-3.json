    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish transcript is generally easy to follow, with a clear dialogue structure and coherent progression of ideas. Sentences are mostly straightforward, and the use of parenthetical explanations helps readers grasp technical concepts. Minor issues arise from occasional over‑complex sentences that could be simplified, but overall the text remains comprehensible for a general audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation flows smoothly for most of the conversation. However, there are a few slightly awkward expressions and literal translations that interrupt naturalness—for example, \"Esta función se llama aprendizaje contextual, o ICL (In‑Context Learning)\" and \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje en un contexto automatizado\". Native speakers might find these constructions mildly unnatural, yet the overall register stays appropriate and contemporary.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms are mostly preserved correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinación\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\". The expansion of ICL as \"Inteligencia Computacional Linguística\" is incorrect (the proper expansion is \"In‑Context Learning\"). Otherwise, terminology is consistent and adequately explained when needed, especially for non‑technical listeners.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation captures the spirit of the original podcast and is culturally accessible to Spanish listeners. The chosen title \"TecnoDestello\" reflects the original intent, and the dialogue uses everyday expressions suitable for the target audience. Some idiomatic nuances (e.g., \"se le ha dado unas apuntes\" instead of a more idiomatic \"se le ha dado una guía\") could be refined, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains all dialogue turns and key points from the French original. No major omissions are evident. The flow of the conversation is preserved, and redundancy is largely avoided. The only small discrepancy is the erroneous expansion of ICL, but this does not affect the overall understanding of the content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation delivers a clear and engaging rendition of the original French podcast. While it excels in readability and contextual adaptation, minor fluency hiccups and a terminology error (the ICL expansion) slightly diminish the polish. With a few refinements, the translation would achieve a near‑perfect score, making it both informative and natural for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The translation is suitable for general consumption and educational purposes, and it respects the original's intent and tone well overall. The overall evaluation scores it 17 out of 20 for overall quality, reflecting strong performance with room for minor corrections. The translation is effective, clear, and culturally adapted, with only a few technical and stylistic adjustments needed to reach full excellence. The final score is 17/20. The translation is solid, and it meets most of the criteria satisfactorily. The small errors do not undermine the overall clarity and impact of the content, making it an excellent rendition for a Spanish audience seeking to understand the concepts discussed in the podcast."
