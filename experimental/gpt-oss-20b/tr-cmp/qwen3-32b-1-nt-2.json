    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly clear and easy to follow. The dialogue structure mirrors the original, and the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are conveyed in a way that a general Spanish‑speaking audience can understand. Some sentences are slightly long or could be split for better flow, but overall the target readers can grasp the concepts without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for native Spanish speakers. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary. A few expressions feel a bit literal (e.g., “anclaje” for “grounding”, “aprendizaje en contexto” for “ICL”), but they are not awkward. Minor grammatical quirks (e.g., “Olvida todo.”) do not hinder comprehension. Overall, the fluency is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto” (ICL), “grounding” (anclaje), “memoria”. The translator also keeps the English acronyms (ICL, LLM) where appropriate. Some terminology could be refined (e.g., “anclaje” might be better rendered as “enraizamiento”), but the current choices are understandable and technically accurate.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience while preserving the original tone and intent. Cultural references and idioms are appropriate (e.g., “consultor brillante”, “consultor temporal vs experto permanente”). The format and sign‑offs (“Gracias por escucharnos, y hasta pronto”) fit the podcast context. No major cultural misunderstandings are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are retained: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the question of a temporary consultant vs a permanent expert. No essential content is omitted, and redundancies are kept minimal. The translation occasionally repeats a phrase (e.g., “una excelente observación”), but overall completeness is high.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is faithful, clear, and largely natural. It preserves the original structure and intent while using appropriate terminology and cultural adaptation. Minor issues remain in some literal translations and a few grammatical nuances, but they do not significantly affect comprehension. The overall quality is excellent, suitable for a general audience familiar with AI concepts."
