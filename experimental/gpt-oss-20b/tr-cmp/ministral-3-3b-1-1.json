  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is highly fragmented, with many incomplete sentences and abrupt changes in style. Readers would struggle to follow the dialogue, especially when the original flow is broken and key phrases are omitted. The overall readability is very low.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains numerous unnatural constructions and grammatical errors (e.g., \"Luc: ...\", \"Luc: ...\", missing accents, abrupt switches between languages). It reads more like a draft or a transcript than a polished translation. Fluency is poor.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While some technical terms are translated (e.g., \"preentrenamiento\"), others remain in English or are partially translated, leading to inconsistency. The translation does not consistently handle key terminology such as \"fine‑tuning\", \"in‑context learning\", or \"grounding\". The overall appropriateness is moderate at best.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains many French idioms and fails to adapt expressions for a Spanish-speaking audience. Cultural references and contextual nuances (e.g., analogies about education) are either missing or not adequately rendered, which weakens the adaptation.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Significant portions of the original dialogue are omitted or only partially translated. Key explanatory passages are missing, resulting in a loss of meaning and context. The translation is incomplete.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "overall_comment": "The provided translation is far from a professional or accurate rendition of the original French text. It suffers from fragmentation, incomplete coverage, inconsistent terminology, and lack of fluency. As a result, Spanish readers would find it difficult to understand the content or follow the conversation. Significant revisions are required to achieve a coherent, complete, and natural translation that faithfully conveys the original message and context. The translation does not meet the standard expectations for a polished, audience‑appropriate bilingual version of the script. The overall quality is low, and a substantial amount of work remains to be done to reach acceptable levels of readability, fluency, and completeness. This evaluation reflects a score of 4 out of 20 for the overall translation quality. The score is based on the cumulative evaluation of the individual criteria and the overall coherence of the translation. The translation is incomplete and lacks both naturalness and clarity for native Spanish speakers. Further effort is needed to correct grammar, fully translate missing portions, adapt cultural references, and ensure consistent terminology throughout the text. The evaluation indicates that this draft is only a starting point and must be extensively revised to meet professional translation standards."
