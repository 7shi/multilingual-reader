  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the sentence structures are clear. However, a few awkward phrasings such as “la IA no ha ‘olvidado’ en el sentido humano del término” and the use of “Imaginen” instead of the more formal “Imagínese” slightly hinder fluidity. Overall the content is understandable, but there is room for smoother wording.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation reads naturally for a Spanish speaker. Minor issues include the use of single quotes around ‘olvidado’, inconsistent punctuation in some parenthetical explanations, and the occasional literal carry‑over of French syntax (“se va a enviar” could be “se envía”). The vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. The overall fluency is good.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are translated correctly and consistently: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje, memoria. The abbreviation ICL is retained, and definitions are provided where necessary. No major mistranslations or omissions. Minor improvement could be a brief explanation of ICL at first mention, but it’s optional.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The script retains the informal podcast style suitable for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Cultural references remain neutral and the overall tone is preserved. Some expressions could be adapted more idiomatically (“El aprendizaje en contexto es como el bachotaje” is acceptable but a more common phrase might be “como estudiar a la última hora”), but the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines and explanatory content from the original French version are present. No substantive details are omitted, and the translation does not add irrelevant information. The text remains concise and clear. The only minor omission is the explicit mention of “Tech Éclair” as a podcast in the introduction, which is present but could be highlighted more strongly. Overall completeness is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is a solid, high‑quality rendering of the French source. It conveys the intended meaning, retains technical terminology, and presents the dialogue in a natural, readable style. Minor linguistic refinements would bring it to near‑flawless fluency, but the translation is already fully functional for a native Spanish‑speaking audience. Overall score: 86/100 (4.3/5)."
