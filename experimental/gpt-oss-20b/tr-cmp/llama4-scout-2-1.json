    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable for a native audience. Sentences are mostly clear and follow the same logical flow as the French original. However, there are a few syntactic slips – for example, “Usted lo ha entendido todo” is awkward, and “la IA se acuerda” uses a reflexive verb incorrectly. Minor punctuation omissions (e.g., missing inverted exclamation marks in some exclamatory sentences) also affect readability slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The overall tone is conversational, but several expressions feel literal or stilted. Words like “empollar” (instead of “estudiar”) and the mis‑use of “se acuerda” detract from naturalness. Pronoun shifts (“Usted” vs “tú”) create inconsistency. The use of “entre bastidores” is understandable but feels more dramatic than needed. These issues reduce fluency modestly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved – ICL, fine‑tuning, grounding, context window, etc. The translation of “in‑context learning” as “Aprendizaje en Contexto” is appropriate. The explanation of transfer learning is clear and consistent. Minor lapses: the phrase “in‑context learning” is sometimes left in English, and “aprenar” could be clarified. Overall terminology handling is good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator kept the casual, podcast‑style tone and adapted cultural references (e.g., replacing “consultant brilliant” with “consultor brillante”) well. Some expressions could be tightened for Spanish‑speaking audiences (e.g., “en la ventana de contexto” instead of “en la memoria a corto plazo”), but the intent and purpose of the original are conveyed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the major points: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, anchoring, memory features, and the contrast between temporary and permanent knowledge. No substantive content is omitted. Redundancy is minimal, and explanatory remarks are included where helpful. Minor missing nuance: the explanation of “anclaje” could be expanded slightly.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful and understandable, maintaining the conversational style of the original podcast script. However, some grammatical inaccuracies, unnatural phrasing, and a few misused terms slightly reduce fluency and readability. The technical vocabulary is handled well, and the overall meaning and structure are preserved. With minor polishing—particularly in pronoun usage and reflexive verbs—the translation would be excellent."
