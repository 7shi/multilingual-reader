  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and follows a logical flow that mirrors the original French script. The translator keeps the conversational style, breaks down complex ideas into simple sentences, and uses everyday vocabulary to explain concepts like pre‑training and in‑context learning. The only minor hindrance is a few slightly awkward phrasing choices (e.g. *« Imaginen que enviamos una IA… »*), but these do not impede comprehension for native readers.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall, the translation reads smoothly for Spanish speakers. The sentence structure is coherent, and the vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. Some expressions could feel a bit literal – for instance, *« la IA no se está afinando… »* and *« Imaginen que enviamos… »* – but the overall flow remains natural. The occasional omission of the closing exclamation mark in a few sentences is a minor grammatical slip but does not significantly impact fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *anclaje*, and *memoria* are all correctly translated. The translator also preserves the French usage of the parentheses and the special punctuation around the podcast title. Minor potential improvement: *afinamiento* is correct but less common than *ajuste fino*; however it is still understood in technical contexts.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator successfully adapts the original tone to Spanish, maintaining a friendly, informal conversation that fits the target audience. Cultural nuances (like using *caja negra* for black box) are preserved, and the dialogue feels appropriate for Spanish listeners. No significant cultural disconnects are apparent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All lines from the French original appear in the Spanish version. No key details are omitted, and the explanation of each concept remains intact. The translator also preserves the final sign‑off line, ensuring a complete episode structure. Minor redundancies were not added, and unnecessary repetition was avoided.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the meaning, tone, and technical content of the original French text. While there are a few slightly literal or awkward phrases, the overall readability and naturalness are strong, making the Spanish version suitable for the intended audience of a podcast on technology and AI. A few small stylistic tweaks could push the fluency to a perfect score, but the current version is already professional and engaging. Good job!  Overall score: 84/100 (42/50 after scaling to 20‑point sub‑scores)."
