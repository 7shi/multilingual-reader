  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly easy to read; the sentence structure follows a logical flow and most technical concepts are explained in plain language. Minor hiccups such as the unnecessary article in *la fase de pre‑entrenamiento* slightly interrupt the flow, but overall a native reader can comprehend the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely natural, but a few phrases feel slightly literal or awkward (e.g., *la fase de pre‑entrenamiento*, *fundamentación* for grounding, and the repetition of *para contar con un especialista a largo plazo?*). These irregularities reduce smoothness, though they do not severely impede understanding.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms are correctly rendered: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*. The word *grounding* is translated as *fundamentación*, which is acceptable but not the most common choice. Overall terminology is consistent and technically appropriate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational tone and humor of the original are preserved, and cultural references remain suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor literalisms exist, but the adaptation effectively conveys the intended meaning for the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French source is retained. The dialogue structure, key explanations, and illustrative examples are present. No significant content is omitted, and the translation remains concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation offers a solid, mostly faithful rendering of the French source. While readability and terminology are strong, some fluency issues and a slightly awkward choice of words for *grounding* reduce the naturalness of the text. Nonetheless, the overall quality is good and the intended message is effectively communicated to a Spanish‑speaking audience."
