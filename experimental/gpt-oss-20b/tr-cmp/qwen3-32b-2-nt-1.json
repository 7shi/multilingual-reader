  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable; most sentences follow a clear, logical order and complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) are explained in a way that a general audience can follow. Minor awkwardness arises in a few literal translations (e.g., “se envía una IA totalmente nueva” sounds a bit formal). Overall, readability is very high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text flows well for most parts. Some expressions feel slightly literal (“Es un episodio que se escucha” could be “Gracias por escuchar”) and the occasional formal “usted” breaks the conversational tone. Vocabulary is contemporary, but a few idiomatic choices could be smoother. Fluency is good, but not perfect.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly translated: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, grounding → anclaje. Consistency is maintained throughout. Only minor variations exist (e.g., “IA” is used consistently). Terminology is appropriate for a general‑tech audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and informal podcast style, respecting Spanish‑speaking cultural norms. Adaptations are subtle and appropriate; no content is culturally out of place. Contextual adaptation is excellent.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All original content is present, with no omitted sections. The translation includes explanations and clarifications that aid comprehension (e.g., “aprendizaje en contexto es como memorizar a corto plazo”). Redundancy is minimal and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is a solid, high‑quality rendition that faithfully conveys the original French dialogue while maintaining clarity and a natural tone. Minor adjustments could polish some phrasing, but the translation effectively communicates technical concepts to a Spanish‑speaking audience."
