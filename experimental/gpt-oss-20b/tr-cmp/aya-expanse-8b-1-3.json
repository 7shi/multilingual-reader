    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, but several sentences are long and structurally awkward. Some explanations that were clear in the French original (e.g., the analogy of a graduate) are rendered with slightly confusing phrasing (“la IA es como un joven graduado universitario”). The overall message is comprehensible, but the flow is hindered by occasional choppy syntax and missing articles, which reduces readability.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural expressions and grammatical slips: missing accents, inconsistent article usage, and awkward parenthetical placement (e.g., \"ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\"). While the vocabulary is generally appropriate, the sentences feel forced at times and lack the natural rhythm expected in a native Spanish podcast script.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and understood in Spanish: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"memoria a corto plazo\". The translation stays consistent with these terms throughout, though some could be refined (e.g., \"preentrenamiento\" vs \"pre‑entrenamiento\"). Overall, terminology is appropriate and well explained for a general audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the core intent and tone of the French script but fails to fully adapt certain expressions to the target culture. Phrases like \"la IA se le\" or literal translation of “grounding” as “anclaje” are acceptable, but some metaphors feel a bit stiff (e.g., “la IA es como un joven graduado universitario”). Cultural nuances of a Spanish‑speaking audience could be better leveraged to enhance engagement.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present, and the script remains faithful to the sequence of ideas. Minor omissions or condensing do not distort meaning, and no essential content is lost. The addition of the phrase “detrás de escena” clarifies the process of memory integration, adding helpful detail.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid but not perfect. It successfully conveys the technical concepts and the conversational structure of the original French podcast, but suffers from occasional awkward phrasing and slight stylistic inconsistencies that reduce the naturalness of the Spanish text. With some refinement in syntax and a more culturally tuned approach, it could reach a higher level of polish suitable for native Spanish listeners."
