  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to read and understand. Sentences follow a logical order and key concepts are expressed clearly. Minor issues include a typo (“Mir”) and occasional awkward phrasing (“es increiblemente flexible” missing an accent), but these do not significantly hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences flow naturally for a Spanish speaker. However, there are some small lapses in verb form and agreement: the switch from plural to singular with \"Has comprendido todo\" versus \"usted\" later, the missing accent on \"increíblemente\", and the somewhat literal \"es un bachotaje\" instead of a more idiomatic expression. These reduce the overall naturalness slightly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled accurately: pre-entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, anclaje (grounding). The translation consistently uses the same terms throughout, and where necessary, the meaning is clarified (e.g., explaining the difference between temporary knowledge and permanent skill).",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and conversational tone. It respects cultural norms, using the familiar “¡Hola” greeting and keeping the podcast format. Slight adaptation needed for the Spanish audience is minimal, and the humor about consultants versus experts is preserved. Minor stylistic improvements could be made (e.g., phrasing “es como contratar a un consultor brillante” instead of the literal literal translation).",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French script is present. No key ideas or nuances are omitted. The translation retains the narrative flow and explanations of pre-training, fine-tuning, ICL, and memory features. Redundancy is not introduced, and the content stays concise while fully explanatory.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is high quality and faithfully conveys the original French content. It reads well for native speakers, preserves technical accuracy, and maintains the podcast’s conversational style. Minor errors—typos, small grammatical inconsistencies, and a missing accent—prevent it from reaching perfect fluency, but these are easily correctable and do not detract significantly from overall comprehension. The translator has delivered a coherent, complete, and culturally adapted version that should serve the target audience effectively. Overall, a strong translation that could be polished to a perfect score with a few quick edits. 18/20 overall."
