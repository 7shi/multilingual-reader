  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally easy to read and follows a logical structure. Sentences are long but coherent, and technical concepts are mostly explained in plain language. Minor issues arise with phrases such as \"apuntador\" and the repetition of \"aprendizaje en contexto,\" but overall the Spanish version is comprehensible for a general audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural to a Spanish speaker. Some awkward word choices appear, e.g., \"apuntador\" (instead of \"extracto\" or \"resumen\") and a few literal translations that feel slightly stilted. The overall flow is smooth, but a few minor tweaks would improve fluidity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\". However, the abbreviation ICL is incorrectly rendered as \"Lenguaje de Comprensión e Investigación,\" which is misleading. The term \"grounding\" is aptly translated as \"anclaje.\" Consistency is good, but the ICL misinterpretation lowers the score.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references are adapted appropriately, and the Spanish-speaking audience should grasp the nuances. Minor context‑specific improvements could be made, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation includes all major points from the original French text. The explanation of ICL is, however, technically inaccurate, which could mislead readers. No essential information is omitted, but the mis‑translation introduces a significant error.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is generally good and understandable, but it contains a notable error in the representation of In‑Context Learning (ICL). Apart from that, the text flows well, uses appropriate terminology, and keeps the conversational tone of the original. Small adjustments in word choice and a correction of the ICL abbreviation would elevate the quality to a near‑perfect level."
