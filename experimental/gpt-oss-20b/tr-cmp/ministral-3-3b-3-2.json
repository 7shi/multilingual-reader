  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is mostly understandable to a native reader, but the presence of meta‑commentary (“Justificación de cambios”, “Nota:”) and occasional incomplete sentences (e.g., *«Es lo que esperábamos.»*) break the flow. Some explanations are either too literal or missing context, which can confuse readers about the core concepts. Overall, the text is readable but not effortlessly clear.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences feel stilted or overly literal (“Imaginen que se envía una nueva IA a una escuela…”), punctuation is inconsistent, and several English terms (e.g., *grounding*, *ICL*) are left untranslated or poorly integrated. The repetition of phrases and awkward word choices reduce the naturalness expected of a polished Spanish text.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto* are generally correct and consistent. However, the translation fails to consistently render *grounding* and sometimes keeps English abbreviations (*ICL*) without explanation, which may confuse non‑expert readers. Overall terminology is adequate but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to adapt the original to Spanish but frequently includes explanatory notes that would not appear in a finished podcast script. Cultural adaptation is limited; the script could benefit from more natural colloquial phrasing (e.g., using *conversaciones* instead of *discusión* in some parts). The intent of the original is largely preserved but the adaptation lacks polish.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The bulk of the original content is present, but the inclusion of meta‑notes dilutes the message, and a few concepts (e.g., the full explanation of *grounding*) are either missing or only partially translated. The text also omits a few nuances present in the French source, which slightly reduces completeness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is a solid, largely faithful rendition that captures most of the technical content, but it suffers from literal phrasing, awkward punctuation, and the intrusion of explanatory meta‑text. The result is understandable but feels unpolished and occasionally confusing. Refinement of style, removal of commentary, and a smoother flow would significantly improve the quality for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The average score reflects a competent but unfinished effort, suitable for a draft rather than a final broadcast script. 13/20 is an appropriate overall evaluation based on the weighted criteria above."
