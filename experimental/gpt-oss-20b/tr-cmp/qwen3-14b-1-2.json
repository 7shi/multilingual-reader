  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows a logical sentence flow. Most complex ideas are explained clearly, and the dialogue format is easy to follow. Minor issues arise in a few sentences where the structure is slightly awkward or where a word that could be clarified is missing (e.g., the missing accent on “preentrenamiento” in some lines). Overall, readability is very good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural to a Spanish‑speaking audience, but there are a handful of awkward or overly colloquial expressions. For instance, \"Ustedes han entendido todo\" feels out of place in a conversation between two hosts; a more natural phrasing would be \"Lo has entendido todo\" or simply \"Lo has entendido\". The use of “bacotaje” for *In‑Context Learning* is very informal and may not resonate with all listeners. These small issues lower the overall fluency slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly translated – *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *grounding* (as *grounding* remains in English), *memoria a corto plazo*. The primary concern is the incomplete translation of *grounding*, which is left in English, breaking consistency. Other terminology is appropriate and consistent, though some terms could be slightly refined for clarity.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and tone of the original podcast are preserved, and cultural references are suitably adapted for a Spanish audience. The translation keeps the informal, conversational style while appropriately localizing expressions (e.g., replacing the French metaphor about a university graduate with a Spanish one). Minor stylistic tweaks could improve cultural resonance, but the adaptation is generally effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original transcript are present, including the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the memory feature. No significant omissions were detected. Some redundant phrasing was removed for conciseness, and the overall length remains appropriate for a podcast script. The only small gap is the untranslated term *grounding*, but this does not affect overall informational integrity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality and faithfully conveys the original content. It is largely readable, natural, and technically accurate. Minor issues with terminology consistency (the untranslated term *grounding*) and a few slightly awkward expressions reduce the overall polish. With minor revisions to address these points, the translation would reach an excellent standard. The average score across criteria yields a solid overall rating of 17/20, reflecting a well‑executed adaptation that could benefit from a brief final review for consistency and style refinement."
