  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is mostly clear and the overall narrative structure follows the original. However, a few sentences become slightly confusing due to literal phrasing or duplicated content, which may hinder quick comprehension for some readers. The main ideas are still understandable.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most of the Spanish sounds natural, there are several instances of awkward phrasing and grammatical errors that disrupt the flow (e.g., \"en marchas forzadas\", \"aprendizaje con contexto e instrucciones\", the long parenthetical note about different translation options). These do not make the text incomprehensible but reduce its smoothness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely correct and consistent: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"In-Context Learning\". Some terminology is slightly off or incomplete (e.g., \"aprendizaje con contexto e instrucciones\" instead of a clean translation of ICL, and the untranslated abbreviation ICL). Minor inconsistencies reduce overall precision.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent but includes an extraneous explanatory sentence about translation choices that should not appear in the final version. The adaptation to Spanish speakers is adequate but this inserted commentary detracts from the professional tone and could confuse listeners.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present and the dialogue structure is preserved. The additional parenthetical about translation options is unnecessary but does not omit any essential information. Overall, the content remains complete and concise enough for the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation communicates the main ideas of the original French script fairly well and uses appropriate terminology in most cases. Nevertheless, a handful of awkward phrasings, a non‑natural parenthetical note, and minor terminology inconsistencies reduce the overall quality. The translation would benefit from a final proofread to remove the extraneous commentary and smooth out the awkward sentences, after which it would be highly effective for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The overall quality is good but not perfect, scoring 15 out of 20 on average across the evaluated criteria. The total score out of 20 is therefore 15, reflecting a solid but improvable translation effort."
