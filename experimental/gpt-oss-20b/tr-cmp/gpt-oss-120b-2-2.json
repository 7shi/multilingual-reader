  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version keeps the original’s logical flow and is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly short and the explanation of concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning is clear. A few clauses are a bit long (e.g. “La IA no ha «olvidado» en el sentido humano de la palabra; su espacio de trabajo temporal simplemente se ha vaciado.”) which could be split for smoother reading, but overall comprehension is good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally for a Spanish speaker. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary. Minor quirks appear: the use of “ella” for the AI in one spot (“ella se olvida”) feels slightly inconsistent with the earlier “la IA”, and the sentence “El propio modelo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus conversaciones” could be smoother as “el modelo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus conversaciones”. Nonetheless, the translation sounds coherent and fluent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"grounding\" (translated as \"anclaje\") are all correct and consistent. The glossary is clear for readers with a general technical background, and the translation offers brief explanations where needed. Minor improvement could be made for the term \"finetuning\" which is consistently rendered as \"ajuste fino\".",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts idiomatic expressions to Spanish without losing the original intent. Cultural references remain neutral and appropriate for a general audience. The phrasing “contratar a un consultor brillante” nicely conveys the consultant analogy in Spanish. No cultural missteps are apparent.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No essential detail is omitted, and the dialogue structure is preserved. Redundancies were avoided while maintaining clarity, so the information is complete and concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is strong overall, offering faithful rendering of the French source with clear explanations of technical concepts. Minor refinements in pronoun consistency and sentence length could enhance readability, but the translation is largely natural, accurate, and well‑adapted for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The overall quality is high, making it suitable for publication in a Spanish‑language podcast transcript or article. 94/100 points (rounded to a 20‑point scale: 18/20)."
