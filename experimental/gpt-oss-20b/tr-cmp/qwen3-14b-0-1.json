  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow, with clear sentence structure and logical flow. Some minor repetitions (e.g., “preentrenamiento” vs “preentrenamiento”) do not hinder comprehension, and the explanations of complex concepts are mostly retained. Therefore, it scores high on readability.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation feels mostly natural, but there are a few awkward expressions such as \"Lo han entendido todo\" and literal phrasing like \"se le dio una pista\". These minor issues slightly affect the smoothness for native speakers. The overall fluency is good, but not flawless.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are largely preserved, but there is inconsistency: \"fine‑tuning\" remains untranslated in one spot, and the abbreviation ICL is not fully adapted. Consistency and proper Spanish equivalents (e.g., \"ajuste fino\") would improve clarity. This reduces the score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation successfully conveys the original intent and keeps cultural nuances appropriate for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Some literal choices slightly alter nuance but overall the context is well adapted.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No major content is omitted; all ideas are present. Minor terminology inconsistencies slightly reduce completeness, but the essential information remains intact.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid overall, with clear structure and faithful conveyance of ideas. Minor improvements in terminology consistency and smoothing of a few expressions would raise the quality to near‑perfect. It is suitable for a general Spanish‑speaking audience with a decent level of technical familiarity."
