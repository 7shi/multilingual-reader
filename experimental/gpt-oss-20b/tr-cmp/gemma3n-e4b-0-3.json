    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to read and the dialogue is clearly segmented into speakers. The sentence structures are mostly straightforward and follow the flow of the original. Minor punctuation errors (e.g., missing commas after greetings) do not significantly hinder comprehension, but a few long sentences could be split for extra clarity. Overall, listeners can follow the narrative without much effort.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most expressions sound natural, but a few choices feel slightly literal or informal. For instance, \"Y soy Luc\" is grammatically acceptable but less common than \"Yo soy Luc.\" The phrase \"¡Una analogía perfecta!\" is fine, yet \"¡Qué buena analogía!\" might flow better. The translation sometimes uses literal literalisms like \"ajuste fino\" for fine‑tuning, which is correct but could be phrased as \"afinamiento\" to match typical tech Spanish. The overall flow is smooth, but these small quirks reduce perfect fluency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, ventana de contexto, anchoring (grounding) is rendered as \"anclaje.\" The translator keeps the parenthetical English acronyms (ICL, GPT) intact, which aids comprehension for Spanish speakers familiar with the tech domain. Explanatory phrases are included where needed, such as the description of what ICL is. Terminology is thus accurate and coherent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent: it keeps the conversational, informal tone appropriate for a podcast audience. Cultural references are minimal, but the translator adapted the address from singular to plural in the last part (“vuestras conversaciones”) to reflect an inclusive audience. The Spanish phrasing is generally culturally appropriate, though a few expressions could be tweaked for better idiomatic resonance.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major parts of the original French script appear in the Spanish version: introductions, explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, memory mechanisms, and closing remarks. No substantive content is omitted, and the translation avoids excessive repetition while maintaining the original pacing. Minor differences in wording (e.g., \"cuando comienza una nueva conversación\" vs \"cuando abre una nueva ventana\") do not alter the meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and largely faithful to the original French script. It preserves the key technical concepts, conversational tone, and structure. Minor refinements in phrasing and punctuation would elevate it to a near‑perfect score, but it already serves as a clear, understandable, and contextually appropriate rendition for Spanish‑speaking listeners."
