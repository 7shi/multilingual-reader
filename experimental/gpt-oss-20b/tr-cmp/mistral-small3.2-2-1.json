  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and easy to follow. Most sentences convey the same logical flow as the French original, and complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in straightforward language. A few long sentences could be split for added clarity, but overall comprehensibility is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The use of idiomatic expressions like \"en lugar de enviarlo\" and the general sentence rhythm are appropriate. However, there are a couple of awkward repetitions (e.g., \"aprendizaje en contexto, o aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\") and a minor typographic slip (missing accents in a few words). These issues slightly hinder the otherwise smooth flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", and \"anclado\" are all accurate. Consistency is maintained throughout. A small caveat is the double use of \"aprendizaje en contexto\" in the same sentence, which could confuse readers, but the meaning remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The show title was adapted to \"Tecnología Revelada\" and later to \"Tecnología Rápida\" which localizes the brand for Spanish listeners. This is a sensible cultural adaptation, though it could be more consistent. The rest of the dialogue stays true to the original intent, respecting the conversational tone and the target audience’s cultural expectations.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present in the Spanish translation. No substantive content is omitted, and the explanatory notes about transfer learning, ICL, and memory features are preserved. The text is concise, with no unnecessary repetition beyond the noted duplication in the ICL explanation.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of both the technical content and the conversational style of the original. It remains faithful to the source while delivering clear, mostly natural Spanish. Minor issues—especially the duplicated phrase regarding in‑context learning and a few typographical slips—prevent it from being flawless, but the overall quality is high and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. With a few small edits, the translation would achieve a perfect score in all categories. The current overall rating reflects this strong performance with room for minor polish: 18/20. The translation effectively conveys the intent, keeps the terminology consistent, and is largely understandable and fluent for native readers. The score reflects an average of the individual criteria, resulting in a final score of 18 out of 20. Overall, it is a well‑executed translation that serves its purpose well."
