    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is readable for a general audience, but the frequent interjection of French fragments (e.g. *C’est tout à fait ça. C’est pourquoi…*) interrupts the flow and creates confusion. Simple sentences are well‑structured, yet the mix‑language style reduces overall comprehensibility for Spanish‑speaking readers.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several constructions feel unnatural – e.g. *On peut dire eso.* instead of *Se puede decir eso.*, and *Il n’a pas besoin de réapprendre* translated as *No necesita volver a aprender* is fine, but the sentence “On peut dire eso.” is ungrammatical in Spanish. Word choices are mostly appropriate, but the blending of French and Spanish creates a choppy rhythm that detracts from smoothness.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento* and *ajuste fino* are correctly rendered. However, *apprentissage par transfert* is partially left in French, and *In‑Context Learning* is translated as *aprendizaje en contexto* but later referred to with the French word *ICL*. This inconsistency weakens the clarity of the terminology. Overall, the core technical vocabulary is present but inconsistently handled.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The script’s intent is mostly preserved, but cultural localization is lacking. The Spanish version keeps many idiomatic French expressions (e.g., *C’est tout à fait ça*) that are not idiomatic in Spanish. Moreover, the mix‑language style can alienate native readers. Some contextually appropriate phrasing (e.g., analogies) is retained, yet the overall adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience could be improved.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely covers all points from the original, including the explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning. However, the embedded French sentences mean that some information is effectively lost for Spanish readers. No major omissions, but the presence of untranslated fragments reduces clarity. The content is largely comprehensive but not fully accessible.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material and retains most of its content. Nevertheless, the interleaving of French language fragments, occasional grammatical slips, and inconsistent terminology undermine the overall quality. A more disciplined approach to full Spanish translation and tighter editing would significantly improve readability, fluency, and cultural relevance. The current version is functional but requires substantial refinement for publication to a Spanish‑speaking audience."
