    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version uses clear, conversational sentences that are generally easy to follow. The core ideas of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning are presented in a straightforward manner. Minor structural issues (missing articles such as *El* before *Entrenamiento previo*) do not significantly impede understanding. Complex concepts are adequately explained with simple analogies, making the transcript accessible to a general audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The overall flow feels natural for Spanish‑speaking listeners. However, there are a few slightly awkward phrasings: *Entrenamiento previo* (missing the article *El*), *Ella lo olvida todo* could be *Olvida todo*, and the sentence *La competencia está incorporada* is a literal translation that sounds clunky. Despite these, the dialogue reads smoothly and uses appropriate contemporary vocabulary.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly. *Pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino* (fine‑tuning), *aprendizaje en contexto*, *memoria* and *transfer learning* are all used consistently. The only discrepancy is the mix of *ajuste fino* and *ajuste*, but this is minor. The terminology matches what a Spanish‑speaking audience would expect and is applied consistently throughout the transcript.",

    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation respects cultural expectations; conversational tone and idiomatic expressions are appropriate. The translator keeps the original intent of the hosts, but the insertion of *Bonjour* in Spanish and the occasional literal translation of *",

    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is preserved. However, there are two notable omissions and one conceptual error:\n1. The opening line *C’est un sujet fascinant* is omitted.\n2. The word *Bonjour* remains in French instead of being translated to *Hola*.\n3. In the exchange where Camille asks if fine‑tuning is transfer learning, the translation incorrectly responds with *ajuste fino* instead of *transferencia de aprendizaje*, misrepresenting the original meaning.\nThese issues reduce completeness slightly.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and mostly faithful to the original French dialogue. It effectively conveys the main ideas in a readable, fluent Spanish style, with accurate terminology and good contextual adaptation. However, a few minor errors—particularly the misinterpretation of the transfer learning concept and the omission of a few lines—detract from perfect fidelity. The translation would benefit from a final proof‑read to correct these points and ensure full accuracy of the technical content."
