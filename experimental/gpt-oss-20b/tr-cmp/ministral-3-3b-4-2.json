  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text contains long, sometimes repetitive sentences and a mix of dialogue with explanatory comments that can distract the reader. While the main ideas are understandable, the flow is interrupted by parenthetical remarks and inconsistent line breaks, making it harder for a typical reader to follow the conversation smoothly.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation uses correct Spanish grammar and a fairly natural tone, but there are several awkward expressions (e.g., “preentrenamiento”, “la IA se le proporcionó un resumen breve justo antes de que comience a interactuar contigo”) and some literal phrasing that sounds stilted to native speakers. Additionally, the interspersed commentary (e.g., “Camille: Dans le contexte…”) breaks the natural rhythm of the dialogue.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “fine‑tuning”, “in‑context learning (ICL)” and “memoria a corto plazo” are correctly translated and consistently used. The translator occasionally adds explanatory paraphrases that help comprehension, which is a plus for a general‑audience target.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent of the original podcast—explaining how AI learns—is preserved, and cultural references (e.g., “consultant brillante”, “montar en bicicleta”) are appropriate for Spanish‑speaking audiences. However, the inserted meta‑commentary about translation choices (e.g., “Camille: Dans le contexte d'un dialogue technique…”) is not part of the original context and may confuse listeners.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The core dialogue is largely present, but several lines are omitted or truncated (e.g., the original exchange about “Je vois” is replaced with a commentary). The translation also contains extraneous explanatory text that isn’t in the source. While the main points remain, some nuances and exact wording are missing, and redundancy is introduced.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures most of the technical content and uses appropriate terminology, but it suffers from readability and fluency issues due to awkward phrasing and interspersed commentary that breaks the narrative flow. For a professional Spanish‑speaking audience, the translation would benefit from a cleaner, more streamlined rendering that focuses solely on the dialogue without added explanatory notes."
