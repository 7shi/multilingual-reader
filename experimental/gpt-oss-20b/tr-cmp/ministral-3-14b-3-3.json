    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is fragmented, with many inserted notes such as \"**Versión mejorada**\" and incomplete dialogue fragments. While individual sentences are mostly intelligible, the overall flow is disrupted, making it hard for a reader to follow the conversation or grasp the structure. The presence of placeholders and repeated lines reduces clarity.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions feel awkward for native Spanish speakers: the hyphenated \"pre-entrenamiento\" (should be without hyphen), repeated meta‑notations, and some literal translations such as \"aprendizaje por contexto\" instead of the more common \"aprendizaje en contexto\". The overall tone is uneven, mixing formal and informal registers inconsistently. The script reads more like a draft than a polished dialogue.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are rendered correctly – e.g., \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ICL\" (In‑Context Learning) – and the glossary is largely consistent. However, some inconsistencies appear (e.g., \"pre-entrenamiento\" vs. \"preentrenamiento\"), and the term \"grounding\" is translated as \"anclaje\" which is acceptable but not universally adopted. Overall terminology handling is adequate but not flawless.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator tries to maintain the original intent, but many parts remain literal or too formal for the target audience. Cultural references are largely preserved, but the dialogue loses some of its original warmth and conversational cadence. Moreover, the inclusion of notes and placeholders hinders proper contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation omits several sections of the original script and contains numerous editorial notes instead of finished lines. Key exchanges are missing, and some parts of the conversation are duplicated or partially removed, resulting in an incomplete narrative. The lack of a cohesive structure also reduces overall completeness.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "overall_comment": "The provided translation appears to be a draft or a set of notes rather than a finished, polished text. While many terms are correctly translated and the core concepts are retained, the fragmentary nature, mixed registers, and numerous placeholders render it unsuitable for publication. A substantial rewrite is needed to achieve coherence, naturalness, and completeness for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The final product should eliminate meta‑notations, streamline the dialogue flow, and ensure consistent terminology throughout. Once those adjustments are made, the translation could reach a much higher quality level."
