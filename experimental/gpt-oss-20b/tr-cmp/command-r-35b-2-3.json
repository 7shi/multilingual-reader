    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but several sentences are long, contain ambiguous pronouns (e.g., *sus* referring to the model), and have awkward word order. Some paragraphs are hard to parse due to the literalness of the translation. 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are multiple instances of unnatural phrasing (“El refinamiento, en cambio, busca crear una habilidad permanente”, “El modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus discusiones”) and grammatical errors (“del modelo” vs “de su modelo”). The text sounds more like a literal machine‑translation output than a natural Spanish narration. 10/20.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are not handled correctly. *In‑Context Learning* was rendered as “Aprendizaje por Inserción y Calibración (ICL)”, which is incorrect. “Fine‑tuning” is sometimes omitted or loosely translated as *afinado* instead of the usual *ajuste fino*. Some terms like *grounding* are translated as *anclaje* (acceptable) but consistency suffers. 7/20.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely literal and does not adapt idiomatic expressions for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The meta‑commentary inserted (“El uso de la palabra 'propuesta'…”) is not part of the source text and creates a cultural mismatch. However, the overall intent of the conversation is preserved. 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The main narrative and concepts are retained, but the erroneous terminology and the extraneous meta‑commentary reduce the faithfulness to the source. Some explanatory parts (e.g., the description of *pre‑training*) are clear, yet the incorrect rendering of ICL and the missing explicit mention of *transformers* in the adaptation context mean important details are misrepresented. 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the gist of the original but suffers from several serious problems: incorrect terminology, awkward phrasing, and the insertion of non‑original commentary. While the overall narrative remains, the lack of linguistic polish and factual accuracy would likely confuse a native Spanish audience. The piece would need significant revision to meet professional standards for a podcast script translation. The total score is 54 out of 100, reflecting a moderate level of quality that requires substantial improvement in terminology, fluency, and contextual adaptation."
