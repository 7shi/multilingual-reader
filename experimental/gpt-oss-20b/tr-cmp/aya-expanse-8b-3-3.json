    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is mostly comprehensible and follows a logical sentence order. However, a number of sentences are either too long, lack proper connectors, or have slightly awkward phrasing that can momentarily confuse the reader. The dialogue format is preserved, but a few instances (e.g., the placement of quotation marks or the abrupt transition in some lines) interrupt the flow. Overall, the text is readable but could benefit from tighter editing to enhance clarity.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the translation is understandable, several expressions are unnatural or grammatically incorrect for native Spanish speakers. Examples include “Luc destaca:” which is not a common construction, “pocas nuevas informaciones” instead of “poca información nueva”, and occasional misuse of prepositions and articles. The overall tone is conversational, but the presence of these quirks reduces the sense of naturalness. The vocabulary is generally appropriate, but the syntax could be smoothed out in several places.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely retained and correctly translated: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\" (although rendered as \"afinado\"), \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", \"ventana de contexto\". The abbreviation \"PLN\" is used without initial definition, which might confuse readers unfamiliar with the term. Nonetheless, the key concepts are conveyed accurately and consistently across the dialogue.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and style intact, with minimal cultural adaptation needed due to the generic, tech‑focused content. The script’s friendly, conversational tone is preserved, and the Spanish version remains suitable for the same audience. Minor improvements could be made to localize idiomatic expressions, but overall the contextual adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. The translation does not omit significant details; it faithfully reproduces the explanations about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory, and the analogy of a consultant. Some redundant phrases are condensed, which helps clarity without losing content. The overall information coverage is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the core content and dialogue structure of the original French script, but it suffers from a few grammatical inaccuracies and unnatural phrasing that diminish readability and fluency. The technical terminology is mostly handled well, though a few inconsistencies and an undefined abbreviation appear. With modest revisions—particularly in sentence construction and word choice—the translation would reach a higher standard of naturalness and clarity while maintaining all essential information."
