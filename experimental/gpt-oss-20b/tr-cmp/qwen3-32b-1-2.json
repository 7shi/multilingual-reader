    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable but suffers from several grammatical mistakes, missing accents (e.g., \"¿Porque\" instead of \"¿Por qué\"), and occasionally abrupt or incomplete sentences that can momentarily confuse a reader. The overall sentence structure follows the original, yet the lack of some punctuation and occasional truncations lower the ease of reading.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many literal, word‑by‑word renderings that feel stilted to a native speaker. Phrases such as \"Tienes todo claro\" and \"El modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus discusiones\" are understandable but not entirely natural. Unnecessary interjections (e.g., \"#black boxes\") and occasional word order oddities reduce smoothness. Nevertheless, the text is largely intelligible and not heavily disjointed.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\". However, there are inconsistencies: the abbreviation \"AIC\" appears instead of the correct \"ICL\" for In‑Context Learning, and the term \"affinage\" is left untranslated and unexplained. The terminology is largely appropriate for a general‑audience tech podcast, but small inaccuracies reduce precision.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational tone of the original is largely preserved, and cultural references (e.g., consultant analogy) translate well. Yet certain localized expressions feel slightly forced (e.g., \"Tienes todo claro\" is a bit informal for a podcast). The translation does not adapt idiomatic French expressions into equally natural Spanish equivalents in a few places, but overall the intent and purpose are maintained.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all of the original content is present in the translation. Minor omissions are evident, such as the mislabeling of ICL as AIC and a few explanatory lines about grounding and context that are either too brief or omitted. No major thematic details are lost, and the conversation flows logically, so the completeness is acceptable but not perfect.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is serviceable and conveys the main ideas of the original French podcast. However, it is hampered by a handful of grammatical errors, missing accents, and a few term mismatches that could distract or confuse a native reader. With a careful copy‑editing pass to fix the small mistakes and align terminology more precisely, the quality would rise significantly to a professional standard suitable for broadcast or publication. The current version is clear enough for casual listeners but falls short of flawless fluency and technical precision expected in a polished translated script. Overall, it’s a good draft that requires refinement rather than a finished product. The average score across categories is 13.4/20, reflecting an adequate but improvable translation."
