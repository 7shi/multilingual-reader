  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is difficult to follow in several places due to repetition, abrupt switches between French and Spanish, and incomplete sentence structures. Although the main ideas are present, the overall flow feels fragmented, making comprehension harder than in a polished translation.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many phrases sound literal and awkward, e.g., \"preentrenamiento\" used repetitively, \"memoria\" without context, and several grammatical errors. The text does not read smoothly for native Spanish speakers, lowering naturalness.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are sometimes correct (e.g., \"preentrenamiento\"), but inconsistencies appear such as \"fine‑tuning\" → \"afinar\" versus earlier use of \"ajustar\". Some terms are missing or misrepresented (e.g., \"in‑context learning\" is partially translated). Overall terminology handling is uneven.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is overly literal; it keeps many French expressions and doesn't adapt cultural references for a Spanish audience. No improvement for clarity or localization is evident, so the intent of the original remains obscured in places.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The core information is largely present, but there are redundancies, omissions (some French nuances are lost), and repeated paragraphs. The translation does not add clarity or remove unnecessary parts, so the completeness is moderate.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation struggles with readability, fluency, and contextual adaptation, and it shows inconsistent terminology use. While most information is conveyed, the text feels disjointed and lacks the natural flow expected in a high‑quality translation. Significant editing is needed to achieve clarity and naturalness for native Spanish readers."
