  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation preserves the overall flow and logical structure of the original French dialogue. Sentences are mostly clear and concise, and the speaker turns are easy to follow. However, a few phrases—such as *« la IA no se perfecciona constantemente por tus conversaciones »*—feel slightly awkward and could confuse a native reader. Overall, the text is quite readable but could benefit from minor smoothing.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The majority of the translation reads naturally and uses contemporary vocabulary. Some expressions are slightly literal or carry an awkward tone: *« Se puede decir eso »*, *« la IA no se perfecciona constantemente por tus conversaciones »*, and the missing article in *« insertará automáticamente esos fragmentos »*. These do not majorly impede comprehension but detract from a fully native feel. Still, the text is fluent enough for a native audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto* and *grounding* are correctly translated and consistent throughout. The translation provides brief context where needed, e.g., explaining *ajuste fino* as a specialization. The only minor slip is the missing hyphen in *preentrenamiento* (should be *pre‑entrenamiento*), but this does not affect meaning. Overall terminology is highly appropriate.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the informal, conversational tone of the podcast and preserves the dialogue’s rhetorical structure. Cultural references remain generic enough for a Spanish-speaking audience. The phrase *« consultar brillante »* is a bit literal; a more idiomatic expression could improve adaptation, but overall the intent and purpose are maintained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant information from the original French is omitted. The Spanish version contains all the speaker exchanges, technical explanations, and examples. The text is concise; redundancy is minimal. The only slight loss is the nuance in the phrase *« Se puede decir eso »* which could have been more explicit, but it does not compromise completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid, faithfully conveying the original content with appropriate technical language and a natural conversational flow. Minor stylistic and grammatical refinements would elevate it to a near‑perfect level. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation that effectively serves its intended audience."
