    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version retains the original's clear, conversational tone, making the concepts understandable for a general audience. Sentence structures are mostly straightforward, though a few long sentences and occasional abrupt transitions slightly hinder smooth reading. Minor punctuation inconsistencies (e.g., missing commas after introductory clauses) also affect readability marginally.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly natural and native‑like, with appropriate idiomatic expressions and a consistent register. However, there are a few points that feel slightly mechanical or formal: \"Y ese aprendizaje comienza con un proceso llamado 'pre-entrenamiento'\" (a more natural phrasing could be \"Y ese aprendizaje comienza con el proceso de preentrenamiento\"), \"Ustedes han entendido\" (plural when the speaker might be addressing a single listener), and the occasional literal translation of French idioms that do not carry the same nuance in Spanish. These minor issues lower the fluency score a bit.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "All key technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"In‑Context Learning\" → \"aprendizaje en contexto\". The terms are consistent throughout and are appropriate for the target audience. One could argue that adding a brief definition for “ICL” (learning en contexto) would aid readers unfamiliar with the abbreviation, but overall terminology handling is excellent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation effectively conveys the original intent and maintains the informal, conversational style suitable for a podcast script. Cultural references are preserved, and the Spanish version adapts idioms where necessary. However, a few expressions could be further localized for naturalness (e.g., using \"a partir de cero\" instead of \"parte de cero\" for a more colloquial feel). Nonetheless, the adaptation is largely successful.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No substantive content from the original is omitted. All dialogue exchanges, explanations, and examples appear in the Spanish version. The translation also keeps the structure of the script, including the closing remarks and speaker introductions. Redundancy is minimal, and the overall content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is a strong, faithful rendering of the original French podcast script. It captures the conversational tone and explains technical concepts clearly. Minor fluency hiccups and occasional word choice tweaks could be improved to achieve a fully natural feel, but these do not detract significantly from overall quality. The translation demonstrates good handling of terminology and contextual adaptation, and it preserves all essential information without omission. It would be well-suited for a Spanish‑speaking audience familiar with basic technical language in AI and machine learning contexts. A few stylistic refinements could push the translation into a perfect score, but as it stands, it is a high‑quality, professional translation."
