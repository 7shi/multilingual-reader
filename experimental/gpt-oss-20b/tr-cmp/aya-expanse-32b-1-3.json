  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version keeps the dialogue structure and the flow of ideas intact. Sentences are mostly short and logical, making complex concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) understandable to a general audience. Minor errors (“Imaginen” instead of “Imagínense”) do not hinder comprehension, so readability is high – 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural for a Spanish‑speaking listener overall, but several phrases feel slightly awkward or grammatically incorrect. Examples: “Imaginen que envían una nueva IA” (incorrect plural), “para proporcionarle una educación general” (could be “para dotarla de una educación general”). These issues lower the fluency score to 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are translated correctly and consistently: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, memoria, IA, anclaje. The translator occasionally uses more descriptive phrases (“vincular las respuestas”) that aid understanding. Thus terminology is strong – 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Cultural adaptation is generally good: the host greeting is adapted, the brand name is localized to “Tecnología Relámpago” (acceptable, though could have kept “Tech Éclair”), and idioms fit Spanish usage. Small inconsistencies in tense or formal address reduce the score slightly – 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French transcript are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory, and the concluding remarks. No major omissions, and the text remains concise, so completeness is high – 19/20.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation faithfully conveys the content and tone of the original French podcast script. While a few grammatical slips and slightly unnatural phrasing reduce fluidity, the overall message is clear, the technical terminology is handled well, and the dialogue remains engaging for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor polishing would raise the translation to near‑perfect quality."
