  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely intelligible and follows the original structure closely, making the content accessible to native readers. Some phrasing is a bit literal (e.g., \"¿es donde entra en juego?\" and \"La IA deja de usar toda esa información.\") and could be smoother, but overall the passage is easy to follow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text mostly reads naturally; however, several expressions feel a little stiff or overly literal (\"en el prompt\", \"aparecerá\" instead of \"se le dará\", etc.). Minor punctuation issues and occasional word‑choice oddities slightly hinder the flow.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled accurately and consistently: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"anclaje\" are all correct and appropriate for a general audience. No major mistranslations.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the conversational tone and cultural context suitable for Spanish listeners. Some idiomatic expressions could be improved (e.g., replacing the literal \"en el prompt\" with a more natural phrase), but the intent and humor of the original are preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present, with no omissions of essential information. Redundancies are minimal and do not detract from clarity. The overall length and detail remain comparable to the source.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is faithful to the original, captures the technical content, and preserves the friendly, explanatory tone of the podcast. Minor awkward phrasings and some literal word choices slightly affect readability and fluency, but the overall quality is high and the translation would be easily understood by the target audience."
