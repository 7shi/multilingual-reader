  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to read and follows a logical sentence structure. The dialogue flows naturally and the explanations of technical concepts are clear. Minor syntactic quirks (e.g., “Imagínese: no enseñarías…”) do not impede comprehension, so the readability score is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for native Spanish speakers. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary, and most sentences sound natural. Some punctuation (colons, commas) and word order could be tightened (e.g., “Imagínese: no enseñarías…”), but overall fluency is excellent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately rendered in Spanish (preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, memoria a corto plazo). Terminology is consistent throughout the episode, and explanations of key concepts are provided where needed. The translation does not introduce incorrect or ambiguous terms.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts idiomatic expressions to Spanish culture while preserving the original intent. The host greetings, cultural references, and explanatory analogies are all localized appropriately. There are no mistranslations that alter meaning, and the tone remains conversational and engaging.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue segments from the original French script are present. No significant content is omitted, and the translation does not add extraneous material. Redundancy is minimal, and the script remains concise yet thorough.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the Spanish translation is of very high quality. It is faithful to the source text, uses correct terminology, and reads naturally for a Spanish-speaking audience. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve flow, but the translation effectively conveys the original message and technical details."
