  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely easy to follow. Sentences are short, logical, and the flow mimics the original dialogue. However, a few structural choices (e.g., missing articles before *ventana de contexto*) slightly interrupt the natural rhythm for native Spanish readers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall fluency is good; the translation sounds conversational. Minor issues include phrases like \"Lo has entendido todo\" which, while understandable, feel a bit mechanical, and the occasional over‑literal rendering of idioms. The overall tone remains natural for a podcast script.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled appropriately. *Pre-entrenamiento*, *entrenamiento especializado*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *grounding* (anclaje) and *ICL* are all correctly translated and consistently used. No significant mistranslations or missing terms are observed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the informal, conversational style of the original French. Cultural references are adapted to a Spanish‑speaking audience, and the dialogue feels tailored to that context. Minor wording choices could be smoothed out for better cultural resonance, but overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original script are present, including the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No essential information is omitted, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers a clear, engaging, and technically accurate rendition of the original French podcast script. While a few phrasing choices could be polished for maximum naturalness, the overall quality is strong and suitable for Spanish‑speaking audiences seeking a clear explanation of AI learning concepts in a podcast format. Minor adjustments in idiomatic expressions would elevate the translation to an exemplary level. Overall, the work demonstrates a solid understanding of both the source material and target language conventions, with a few small opportunities for refinement to achieve perfect fluency and readability."
