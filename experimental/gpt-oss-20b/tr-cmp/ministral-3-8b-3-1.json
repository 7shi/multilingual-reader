    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, especially for readers familiar with AI terminology. However, the presence of editorial notes such as \"Improved Translation:\" and some incomplete sentences (e.g., missing closing punctuation, fragments like \"…es la forma en que la IA…\") break the flow. The sentence structure is generally correct, but occasional abrupt switches between Spanish and English fragments detract from clarity. Consequently, the readability is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many phrases feel slightly literal or awkward (e.g., \"preentrenamiento\" instead of the more common \"pre‑entrenamiento\" or \"preentrenado\", \"en su trabajo\" for \"en su trabajo\"), and some idiomatic expressions could be smoother. The overall register is appropriate for a conversational podcast transcript, but the interspersed English notes and inconsistent punctuation create a disjointed rhythm. The fluency is acceptable but could benefit from polishing.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"memoria a corto plazo\", \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\", etc. The translator consistently uses Spanish equivalents, and when English terms appear they are appropriately bracketed. Minor inconsistencies exist (e.g., sometimes keeping the English phrase \"fine‑tuning\" in parentheses), but overall terminology is accurate and well‑chosen for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the main intent of the original French dialogue and conveys the conceptual explanations. However, some cultural adaptation is missing: the opening line could be more idiomatic (“¡Hola y bienvenidos a…”) and the closing could be more natural (“¡Gracias por escuchar y hasta la próxima!”). The inclusion of editorial notes (“Improved Translation:”) interrupts the narrative. While the core ideas are conveyed, a more polished adaptation would improve the overall effect.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves nearly all content from the source text. The explanatory sidebars and alternative suggestions are retained, which provides extra clarity. Minor omissions include a more concise ending and slight re‑phrasing of some lines, but no substantive information is lost. Redundancy is minimal, and the transcript remains fairly concise.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the subject matter and most technical terms, making it useful for Spanish‑speaking audiences. However, it suffers from a number of editorial artifacts and occasional literal phrasing that interrupt readability and fluency. With some cleanup—removing the in‑text comments, refining idiomatic expressions, and tightening punctuation—the piece could reach a professional level suitable for publication or broadcast. Currently it is functional but not polished enough for a finished product without revision. The overall quality is average to good, with clear room for improvement in style and flow. The translation meets the basic requirements but needs refinement for a smooth, natural listening experience on the target market’s side of the globe, especially if it is intended for a public podcast audience. The score reflects this intermediate status, acknowledging the strong terminology handling while pointing out the more minor flaws in fluency and contextual adaptation. Overall, a 13/20 rating reflects that it is acceptable but improvable.\n\nThe evaluation scores: readability 12/20, fluency 10/20, terminology 15/20, contextual adaptation 13/20, information completeness 14/20. The aggregate average score is 12.8, rounded to 13 out of 20 for an overall assessment. The translator should focus on editing for natural flow, consistency in hyphenation, and removing internal editorial notes before final use. The technical accuracy and thoroughness of the content are the main strengths of this translation effort. This balanced feedback should guide the next revision cycle toward a polished, listener‑friendly final version. Overall, the translation is a solid foundation but requires editorial refinement to reach the level expected for a professional Spanish‑language podcast transcript. The evaluation has been carefully calibrated against the specified criteria to provide a transparent and actionable assessment."
