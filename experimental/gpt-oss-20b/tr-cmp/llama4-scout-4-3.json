    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is broken into many short fragments and meta‑commentary sentences. While the basic ideas of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are present, the flow is disrupted by frequent asides and repeated translations. Readers can grasp the concepts, but the text is difficult to follow because of the fragmented structure and occasional missing links between sentences. 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural phrasings (e.g., \"aprenderá el francés a una velocidad increíble\", \"por lo que se mantiene la fidelidad al original\"), literal carry‑overs, and inconsistent punctuation. Many sentences feel stilted or incomplete, and some English terms are left untranslated. Overall, the text sounds clumsy to a native Spanish speaker. 10/20.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled unevenly: \"pré‑entraînement\" is rendered as \"pre‑entrenamiento\" in some places and \"preentrenamiento\" in others; \"fine‑tuning\" is mostly left in English; \"grounding\" is translated as \"anclaje\" only once. The translator does not consistently provide explanations or choose the most common Spanish equivalents. 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator attempts to adapt idioms and cultural references, but many adaptations are either too literal or incorrect (e.g., \"aprenderá el francés a una velocidad increíble\" instead of a more idiomatic expression). Some phrases that rely on French wordplay are lost or poorly rendered. The overall intent is preserved, yet the adaptation could be smoother and more culturally resonant. 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "While most key points of the original dialogue appear, the translation is interspersed with editorial comments and suggestions that distract from the core content. Some details, such as the nuanced difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, are mentioned but not fully fleshed out. The text is not fully concise; redundancies are present. 10/20.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates an awareness of the source material and attempts to render technical concepts in Spanish, but it suffers from structural fragmentation, inconsistent terminology, and awkward phrasing. The end result is a text that is partially understandable but not polished or fully faithful to the original. The translator should focus on streamlining the narrative, standardizing technical terms, and removing meta‑commentary to improve clarity and fluency before delivering a final version. The overall quality is moderate but needs substantial revision to meet professional translation standards."
