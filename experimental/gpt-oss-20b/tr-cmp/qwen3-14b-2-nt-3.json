    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely readable for Spanish speakers. Sentences follow a logical order and the core ideas of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are conveyed clearly. Minor issues arise from slightly awkward phrasing such as \"y durante mucho tiempo\" or “por lo tanto, después del preentrenamiento,” which could be smoother, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall, the text sounds natural to a native speaker. However, there are a few syntactic oddities: the phrase \"y durante mucho tiempo\" is less idiomatic than \"y durante mucho tiempo,\" and the repetition of the word \"éclair\" (though a brand) can feel jarring. The line that remains in French—\"D'accord.\"—breaks fluency. Despite these, the translation maintains a smooth flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: \"preentrenamiento,\" \"ajuste fino,\" \"aprendizaje por transferencia,\" \"ventana de contexto,\" and \"memoria\". The Spanish equivalents are correct and familiar to the target audience. Minor omissions include the parenthetical English form of \"fine‑tuning,\" but the Spanish term alone suffices. Terminology is accurate and coherent throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references well, using Spanish idioms such as \"levantar el velo\" and \"cajas negras.\" The brand name \"Tech Éclair\" is preserved, which is acceptable for a brand. The adaptation of the French phrase \"D'accord\" into Spanish was missed, which slightly undermines contextual adaptation. Overall, the tone and style suit a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major sections of the original script are present in the translation. The only notable omission is the untranslated French line \"D'accord.\" This is a minor error that does not change the meaning but indicates incomplete handling of the source text.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and conveys the main ideas of the original French script. Terminology is handled with care and consistency, and the text is generally fluent and readable. The presence of a single untranslated French phrase and a few slightly awkward phrasings are the primary shortcomings, but they do not substantially detract from the overall quality. With minor refinements, the translation would achieve near‑perfect clarity and naturalness for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
