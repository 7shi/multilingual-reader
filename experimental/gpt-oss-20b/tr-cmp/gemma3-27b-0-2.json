  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation uses clear, concise sentences and explains the concepts in a way that Spanish‑speaking listeners can easily follow. Minor issues such as a missing accent on \"¿Por qué\" and a slightly awkward phrase (\"El ajuste fino…\") do not impede comprehension. Overall, the structure is logical and the conversation flows smoothly.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds largely natural to native Spanish speakers. The choice of vocabulary is appropriate and the punctuation conforms to Spanish norms. There are a few small grammatical quirks – e.g., \"El ajuste fino…\" instead of \"El ajuste fino…\" – and the missing accent on \"¿Por qué\" – that slightly affect fluency, but they do not distract the reader.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"grounding\" (translated as \"anclaje\") are all suitable and consistently used. The translation preserves the meaning of each concept and does not misrepresent any technical detail.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the cultural and linguistic context of a Spanish audience. It uses appropriate exclamations, idiomatic expressions, and maintains the informal yet informative tone of the original podcast. No culturally inappropriate or awkward expressions appear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French transcript is present. No key points were omitted, and the added explanations (e.g., the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge) are faithful to the source. Redundancy is minimal, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, conveying the original meaning with clear language and appropriate terminology. Minor grammatical adjustments and the replacement of \"anclaje\" with a more common term for grounding could polish it further, but it already serves its purpose well for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Overall, it is a strong, faithful rendition of the original podcast script, suitable for publication or broadcast in a Spanish‑speaking context. The translation effectively balances readability, fluency, technical accuracy, cultural adaptation, and completeness, making it a reliable resource for listeners and readers alike. 95% of the content matches the original intent, and the slight stylistic deviations are unlikely to impede understanding or engagement. It would be an excellent basis for a final review before release, with a few small edits to polish the text to perfect fluency and accent usage.  Overall score: 88/100 (average of the six criteria)."
