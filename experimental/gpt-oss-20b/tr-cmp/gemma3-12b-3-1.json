  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. The sentence structure mirrors the original conversational style, and key concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL) are explained in straightforward language. Some complex metaphors (e.g., “una IA como un joven universitario”) remain clear, but occasional phrasing like “le enseñaría” can feel slightly literal. Overall, readers can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural for native Spanish speakers. However, a few expressions feel slightly stiff or non‑idiomatic, such as “Tecno Revelada” instead of a more common show title, and “le enseñaría” instead of “le enseñarías” or “le mostraría”. Vocabulary is contemporary and appropriate, but minor grammatical tweaks would improve flow.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved (pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto). The term ‘grounding’ is rendered as ‘fundamentación’, which is understandable but not the most common choice; alternatives like ‘enraizamiento’ or ‘basado en datos’ could be clearer. The abbreviation ICL is kept, maintaining consistency. Overall, terminology is correct and consistently applied.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone, adapting idioms for a Spanish-speaking audience (e.g., consulting analogy). Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is mostly literal, which is suitable. Minor adjustments could improve local flavor (e.g., using “consultor” instead of “consultant”), but the essence is preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French original is present. The dialogue flow, explanations, and examples remain intact. No major omissions are detected, and redundancies are avoided. Minor stylistic repetitions (e.g., “Le perfeccionamiento” vs “El perfeccionamiento”) are negligible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation delivers the core message accurately and clearly, maintaining the conversational tone of the original podcast script. While some phrasing could be polished for greater naturalness and the terminology could be slightly refined, the translation is competent, readable, and faithful to the source material. It serves its purpose well for a Spanish‑speaking audience, especially those familiar with AI concepts. The overall quality is high, with minor room for improvement in stylistic fluency and term nuance. 17/20 marks reflect a solid, reliable translation that meets the intended communicative goals with only slight refinements needed for optimal polish. 18/20 would be achievable with fine‑tuning of idiomatic expressions and terminology consistency."
