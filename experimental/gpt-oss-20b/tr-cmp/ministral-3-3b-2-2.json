  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish script contains many parenthetical notes and meta‑commentary that interrupt the flow of the dialogue. These interjections (e.g., *Opción 1*, *Opción 2* and explanations about translation choices) confuse the reader and make the overall text harder to follow. The core ideas are present, but the added commentary and occasional awkward phrasing reduce clarity. Overall, readability is moderate at best.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the core vocabulary is generally correct, several sentences feel clunky or unnatural for a native Spanish speaker. For instance, *«Hoy vamos a explorar»* and *«Se olvida todo»* are acceptable, but the presence of inserted commentary, mis‑placed commas, and inconsistent use of accents (*bienvenido/a*) disrupts the natural rhythm. The text also mixes English acronyms (ICL, finetuning) without clear Spanish equivalents. Fluency is therefore fairly good but not polished, earning a moderate score.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *finetuning*, *aprendizaje por transferencia* and *ventana de contexto* are correctly translated and largely consistent. However, some key concepts (e.g., ICL) are left in English, and the dialogue includes unexplained parenthetical notes on translation options, which detract from the clarity of terminology usage. Overall, terminology handling is acceptable but could be more consistent.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation changes the show’s name from *Tech Éclair* to *Tecno Relámpago*, which might confuse listeners familiar with the original brand. Apart from that, the dialogue is adapted reasonably to Spanish culture, but the inserted commentary and explanatory notes are unnecessary and break immersion. Contextual adaptation is therefore decent but not optimal.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the main ideas and conversational structure of the original script. Nevertheless, the added meta‑commentary and occasional omissions of short phrases (e.g., subtle nuances in the French original) slightly reduce conciseness. The core information remains intact, but the extra commentary adds redundancy. Information completeness is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures most of the original content and uses appropriate technical terminology. However, the presence of extraneous explanatory notes, occasional unnatural phrasing, and a change of the show’s name weaken readability, fluency, and contextual fidelity. The result is a moderately understandable text that could be improved by removing interjections, smoothing sentence flow, and maintaining consistent branding. Overall, the translation is functional but falls short of a polished, professional script for a Spanish‑speaking audience. A final score of 12/20 reflects these strengths and weaknesses."
