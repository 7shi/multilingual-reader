  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation uses clear sentence structures and explains complex concepts in an accessible way. Some phrases such as *‘memorizar a corto plazo’* or *‘ajuste fino’* are perfectly understandable to a general audience, though a few minor refinements could improve flow. Overall, readers can easily follow the conversation.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural for native speakers, with idiomatic expressions and appropriate register. Occasional awkward constructions appear, e.g. *‘La IA no se refina constantemente por medio de tus conversaciones’* could be phrased more smoothly, but these do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *grounding*. The Spanish equivalents are current and widely accepted, ensuring that the audience recognises each concept.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references suitably for a Spanish-speaking audience. Phrases like *‘consultor brillante’* and *‘consultor permanente’* are appropriate and resonate with the target demographic. No cultural missteps are evident.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the original French script is present. No omissions or additions distort the meaning, and redundant parts are preserved only when they mirror the original structure. The translation remains concise while fully conveying the intended message.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, accurately reflecting the source text’s intent, tone, and technical detail. Minor fluency adjustments could enhance readability, but the current version is already functional and professional for a podcast audience. Overall, it demonstrates a strong grasp of both language and content domain, delivering a clear, engaging, and faithful rendition of the original French script. The translation achieves a balanced performance across readability, fluency, terminology, contextual adaptation, and completeness, making it well-suited for its intended purpose and audience. Minor stylistic polish could elevate it to an exemplary standard, but the existing work stands out as a competent and effective translation for a Spanish-speaking tech podcast audience."
