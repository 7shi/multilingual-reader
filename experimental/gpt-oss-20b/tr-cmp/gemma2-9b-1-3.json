  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable, with clear explanations of the concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning. However, the presence of untranslated French fragments (e.g., \"C'est tout à fait ça\") and a few awkward sentence constructions make the flow less smooth, especially for readers who may not be fluent in French. The overall sentence structure is logical, but minor edits would improve readability.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While many sentences read naturally, there are several instances of unnatural phrasing or grammatical mistakes (e.g., \"Ustedes han comprendido todo\" instead of \"Ustedes lo han comprendido todo\"). The translation occasionally mixes languages, keeping French phrases like \"C'est tout à fait ça\" and using English abbreviations (ICL) without clarification. These issues reduce the overall fluency and make the text feel slightly disjointed.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\" and \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" are correctly rendered. However, the term \"grounding\" is left untranslated, and the explanation of certain concepts (e.g., the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge) is sometimes missing or unclear. Consistency is adequate, but some terminology could be better aligned with Spanish technical language.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and tone of the podcast are preserved. The dialogue format and informal, conversational style work well for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor cultural adaptations (e.g., using Spanish idioms) could enhance relatability, but the translation generally respects the original context.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is present, but a few French fragments and missing translations (e.g., the sentence that begins with \"C'est tout à fait ça\") lead to small omissions. Additionally, some explanatory passages that clarify how ICL works are slightly truncated. The core message is retained, but a few details are lost.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main ideas and follows the dialogue structure, but it suffers from a handful of untranslated French fragments, minor grammatical errors, and a few missing explanatory details. With a few edits—removing the remaining French lines, polishing sentence structures, and ensuring all technical terms are consistently translated—the text would achieve a high level of readability, fluency, and completeness for Spanish‑speaking audiences."
