    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the overall structure of the dialogue and uses sentences that are generally clear and logical. Simple explanations of concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are conveyed in a way that most Spanish‑speaking listeners can follow. However, some minor sentence fragments (e.g., “Tienes todo comprendido.”) feel slightly abrupt and could be smoothed. Overall, the text is readable and comprehensible for a general audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly natural, but a few word choices and idiomatic expressions could be improved for a native‑speaker audience. For instance, “el aprendizaje en contexto es como repasar intensamente para un examen” is correct but a more common phrasing would be “como estudiar intensamente para un examen.” The use of “ancrage” instead of a Spanish equivalent (“anclaje”) and the capitalised “Memoria” feel slightly out of place. Grammar is generally sound, though occasional awkwardness appears in the flow of dialogue.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL (In‑Context Learning) are correctly rendered. The translator keeps the English acronyms (ICL) and explains them. Minor inconsistencies appear (e.g., ‘ancrage’ is left untranslated instead of ‘anclaje’), but overall the terminology is appropriate, consistent, and comprehensible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish adaptation retains the original intent and informal podcast tone, using colloquial phrases like “una nueva ventana” and “consultor brillante”. Cultural adaptation is adequate; however, some expressions could be further localized (e.g., “no tiene ninguna idea” → “no tiene ni idea”). The translation keeps the conversational flow and humor, effectively conveying the original purpose.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines are present, and no significant content has been omitted. The translator includes the same explanatory content, and even adds clarifying parentheses (e.g., “(grounding)”). Redundancy is minimal, and the translation remains concise while preserving the necessary detail.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful and well‑structured, successfully conveying the original French podcast’s explanations of AI learning methods. While minor stylistic and terminological adjustments could enhance fluency, the text remains clear, accurate, and approachable for Spanish‑speaking listeners."
