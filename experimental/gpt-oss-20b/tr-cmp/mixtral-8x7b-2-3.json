    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly understandable and follows the logical flow of the original. However, there are several places where the sentence structure is awkward or incomplete (e.g., “¡Qué te?” and the interjected “I am seeing”). These fragments disrupt the reading rhythm and may confuse readers. The core concepts are conveyed, but clarity could be improved with smoother phrasing and removal of untranslated fragments.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation exhibits several unnatural expressions and grammatical slips. Phrases like “¡Qué te?” are idiomatically incorrect, and the insertion of an English fragment (“I am seeing”) breaks the flow. Vocabulary is generally appropriate, but word choice could be more idiomatic (“especialización” instead of “fine‑tuning” is acceptable but less technical; “aprendizaje en contexto” is good). Overall, the text feels a bit stilted for a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning” rendered as “especialización”, “in‑context learning” as “aprendizaje en contexto”, “memory” as “memoria a corto plazo”. The term “transfer learning” is rendered as “aprender por transferencia”, which is understandable. Consistency is good, though the choice of “especialización” for fine‑tuning is less precise than “ajuste fino”. Nonetheless, the terminology conveys the intended meaning.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the title to “Tech Iluminado” and keeps the dialogue style. Cultural references are generally appropriate. However, some adaptations are less natural (e.g., “¡Qué te?”). The overall intent of the original is preserved, but the adaptation could better match Spanish idioms and avoid literalism in certain parts.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The majority of the original information is present. Minor omissions or distortions include the awkward “¡Qué te?” and the English fragment, which do not add value. No major content is missing, but the presence of these errors slightly reduces the completeness. The dialogue’s structure and key points are intact.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is comprehensible and covers the main points of the original French script. However, it contains several awkward expressions, literal translations, and an interjected English phrase that break the flow. Technical terms are largely correct, but some choices could be more precise. Overall, the text would benefit from a polish to improve fluency and remove non‑Spanish fragments before it can be considered a high‑quality professional translation."
