  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation uses clear and straightforward language that most native speakers can follow. Technical concepts are adequately explained, and the overall sentence flow is logical. Minor instances of literal phrasing or missing conjunctions slightly interrupt the flow, but the text remains comprehensible.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly smooth, but there are several spots where the wording feels slightly literal or awkward—for example, \"Lo han entendido\" (plural) instead of \"Lo has entendido\" and the blend of French and Spanish in \"Bonjour y bienvenido\". Vocabulary is mostly appropriate, yet a few expressions could be more idiomatic. These issues lower the naturalness slightly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje (grounding)\", and \"memoria a corto plazo\". The translation consistently applies these terms throughout the text, which aids understanding. No significant terminology errors or omissions are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent of the original podcast is preserved, but the opening line \"Bonjour y bienvenido\" unnecessarily mixes French and Spanish, which is culturally jarring. Other than that, the translation considers the target audience and does not introduce inappropriate cultural references. The adaptation is adequate but could be slightly refined for full naturalness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present in the Spanish version. No major information is omitted, and the dialogue flows without losing content. Minor nuances, such as the exact phrasing of “Lo han entendido”, do not affect the conveyed meaning. The translation is concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is strong overall, successfully conveying the technical content and the conversational tone of the original podcast. While there are a few literal phrasings and minor grammatical inconsistencies that reduce naturalness, the message remains clear and accurate. With a few minor edits—particularly in pronoun agreement and eliminating the French-Spanish mix—the translation would achieve an excellent level of fluency and cultural adaptation. The overall quality is good, suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience interested in AI concepts, and would benefit from a final polish to address the highlighted issues. The total score reflects a solid, high‑quality translation with room for minor improvements in naturalness and stylistic refinement."
