  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable, but several mistakes reduce clarity. The most noticeable issues are missing accents (e.g., \"¿Porque\" should be \"¿Por qué?\"), incorrect article usage (\"una conocimiento\" instead of \"un conocimiento\"), and a mix of French words in the middle of Spanish sentences. These errors interrupt the flow and can confuse readers, especially non‑native speakers. Nevertheless, the overall meaning is usually preserved, so the score reflects moderate readability.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many awkward constructions and unnatural phrasings, such as \"Usted lo tiene claro\" (instead of a more natural \"Lo tiene claro\") and the overuse of the word \"precisely\" in a Spanish context. The frequent insertion of French phrases (e.g., \"D'accord\" and a whole block of French at the end) severely compromises naturalness. The lack of proper accents and occasional mis‑punctuation also detract from fluency. Thus the score is relatively low.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms are largely preserved: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\", \"memoria a corto plazo\". However, the term \"apri en contexto\" is misspelled with a hyphen and several expressions are literal translations that feel unnatural (e.g., \"reentrenar\" instead of \"re‑entrenar\"). The inconsistent use of accents on technical words like \"aprendizaje\" and the mixture of French terminology in Spanish sentences reduce consistency. The score reflects these inconsistencies.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator attempts to adapt some cultural references, such as changing \"décryptons\" to \"analizamos\". However, the inclusion of French phrases and the literal translation of idioms (e.g., \"Es ahí donde\" instead of a more idiomatic Spanish equivalent) indicate a lack of full contextual adaptation. The translator also keeps the original sentence order and structure, but the heavy reliance on French can alienate Spanish‑speaking listeners. Score reflects this partial adaptation.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is present, but the final paragraph is left in French, which could confuse readers. Some nuance is lost in a few translations, such as \"Es ahí donde interviene el concepto de anclaje\" (instead of the smoother \"Es ahí donde se presenta el concepto de anclaje\"). Despite these omissions, the overall narrative remains intact. Score acknowledges both presence and minor losses.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation communicates the main ideas of the original French script, but it suffers from significant linguistic and contextual errors. Missing accents, grammatical mistakes, and the intrusion of French phrases break the flow and reduce naturalness. Technical terminology is largely preserved, yet inconsistencies in phrasing and word choice diminish clarity. The translation could benefit from a thorough proofreading and localization to meet native‑speaker expectations. Overall, the quality is moderate but requires revision for publication or professional use. The overall score, reflecting an average of the five criteria, is 12 out of 20. "
