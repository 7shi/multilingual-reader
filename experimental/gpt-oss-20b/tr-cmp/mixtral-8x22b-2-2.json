  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable for a native speaker. Sentence structures follow typical Spanish patterns, and the dialogue format is preserved. However, a few phrases feel slightly awkward (“puedes tomar un modelo experto en inglés y luego presentarle…”). Overall, readers can follow the conversation without major confusion.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation reads naturally and uses contemporary vocabulary. Some minor issues arise from literal transpositions, such as the retention of the French word *ancrage* and the phrase “Inteligencia Computacional Linguística”, which sound unnatural in Spanish. Despite these slips, the overall flow remains smooth.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms like *pre-entrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *aprendizaje por transferencia* and *ventana de contexto* are correctly rendered. The acronym ICL is inconsistently handled: it is first kept in English, then later translated incorrectly to *Inteligencia Computacional Linguística*. This inconsistency may confuse readers. Additionally, *ancrage* is left untranslated, whereas *anclaje* would be preferable.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original intent well, retaining the names, tone, and structure. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is adequate. Minor inconsistencies appear in the podcast name—*TecnoDestello* is introduced, yet the closing line reverts to *Tech Éclair*, which could confuse listeners.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the source are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, memory, and the consultant metaphor. No critical content is omitted. However, some explanatory passages are slightly condensed, and the repeated *Inteligencia Computacional Linguística* may mislead readers about the ICL concept.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is overall strong, capturing the conversational style and technical concepts with clarity. Minor terminological inaccuracies and a few unnatural phrases slightly detract from its polish. A more careful handling of acronyms and consistent use of the podcast title would elevate the quality."
