  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely easy to understand. The sentence structure follows a natural flow and the speaker turns are clearly marked. Minor points such as “partes” instead of “parte” and the slightly verbose wording in a few places slightly reduce clarity, but overall the content is comprehensible to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly in most parts. However, expressions like “Entrenamiento ajustado” are not the most idiomatic choice (the common term is “ajuste fino”), and “Lo has comprendido todo” feels slightly awkward. The abbreviation “ACL” for “Aprendizaje en Contexto” is inconsistent with the earlier use of “ICL”. These issues mildly detract from the naturalness of the text.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly. The use of “ajuste fino” or “entrenamiento ajustado” is acceptable, and “grounding” is rendered as “anclaje”. The only notable mismatch is the abbreviation for ICL/ACL. Overall consistency is good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the informal, conversational tone and the explanatory intent of the original. Cultural references are appropriately adapted, and the dialogue feels natural to Spanish listeners. The small inconsistency in the abbreviation is the only contextual slip.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present. No significant omissions or extraneous additions. The information remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "This is a solid, high‑quality translation that effectively conveys the original message with only minor naturalness and terminology issues. It would be suitable for a native Spanish‑speaking audience with minimal editing needed."
