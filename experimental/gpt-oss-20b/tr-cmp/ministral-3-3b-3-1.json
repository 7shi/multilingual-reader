  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is mostly intelligible but the presence of explanatory parenthetical remarks and mixed-language annotations (French‑Spanish) interrupts the flow. The core dialogue remains understandable, though the added comments may distract readers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several phrases feel awkward or literal (e.g., \"Se envía una nueva IA a la escuela\", \"La IA no 'olvida' en el sentido humano\"). There are also inconsistent uses of accent marks and foreign quotation marks. The overall sound is acceptable but not entirely natural for native speakers.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, and *memoria* are used consistently and correctly. A few terms are left in English (e.g., \"grounding\"), but these do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to keep the original intent but includes many editorial notes and some mistranslations (e.g., \"c’est une observation très valiosa\"). These notes break the natural flow and slightly distort the original tone.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all content from the original is present, though some lines are interleaved with explanatory comments. The transcript remains largely complete, but the extra commentary can be seen as superfluous.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the main ideas and most technical terms, but the inclusion of translator notes, occasional mistranslations, and awkward phrasing lowers its suitability for a polished Spanish‑speaking audience. The core content is intact, yet the text would benefit from editing to remove the parenthetical notes and smooth out the language."
