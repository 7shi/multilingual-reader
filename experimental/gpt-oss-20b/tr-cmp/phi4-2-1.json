  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and the dialogue structure is preserved. However, some sentences contain awkward phrasing or slightly ambiguous word choices that could confuse readers (e.g., \"la memoria a corto plazo de la IA, o 'contexto'\" and \"la IA no está constantemente afinada\"). These issues lower overall readability but do not render the text incomprehensible.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for most parts, but there are several places where the natural flow of Spanish is disrupted: \"sería excesivamente ineficiente\" (would be better as \"sería muy ineficiente\"), \"se puede decir eso\" (could be \"se podría decir\"), and the repeated use of abbreviations without explanation. Overall, the text is fluent but with noticeable minor errors.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, grounding, and ICL are correctly rendered. The abbreviation AIC is misleading (it expands to \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\" but should be ICL). Additionally, some terms like \"memoria a corto plazo\" are slightly mis‑phrased. Consistency is mostly maintained, but a few corrections are needed.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to adapt expressions for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but a few choices feel unnatural (e.g., \"la IA no está constantemente afinada\", \"se puede decir eso\"). The overall intent is preserved, yet some cultural nuances could be better handled, such as using \"ventana de contexto\" instead of simply \"contexto\".",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French transcript are present. No major content was omitted, and the structure of the conversation is intact. Minor details (e.g., the explicit meaning of the abbreviation ICL) could be clarified, but overall the information is complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation accurately conveys the main ideas of the French original and is largely readable. Some stylistic and terminological refinements would improve clarity and naturalness. Minor grammatical adjustments and clearer abbreviation usage would raise the quality to a higher level of fluency and precision, but the current version is functional for a general Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts."
