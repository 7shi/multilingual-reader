  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, but some sentences have awkward structure that could confuse a casual reader. For example, \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\" is a literal translation that feels formal and slightly unnatural. The flow of ideas follows the original, yet a few phrasing choices (e.g., \"enviar una IA completamente nueva a la escuela\") are not idiomatic in Spanish. The overall readability is good but could be smoother.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural expressions and grammatical quirks. Phrases like \"enviar una IA completamente nueva a la escuela\" and \"en lugar de enviarlo a un programa de formación de varios años\" do not sound natural to native speakers. There are also some missing articles and slightly abrupt turns of phrase (e.g., \"Olvida todo\"). While the vocabulary is appropriate, the overall flow is uneven, lowering fluency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\". The translation stays consistent with the original terminology and includes explanatory context where needed. Minor inconsistencies such as capitalizing \"IA\" in some places are not problematic for comprehension. The terminology is clear and appropriate for a general audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator generally preserves the intent of the original. However, some cultural adaptations feel off: the expression \"enviar una IA a la escuela\" is literal and does not align with how Spanish speakers would describe training a model. A more natural phrasing would be \"entrenar la IA\" or \"exponerla a una amplia base de datos\". Other than that, references to consulting and memory functions are adequately adapted to Spanish context.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. The translation does not omit any key ideas such as the difference between fine‑tuning and in‑context learning, the notion of temporary memory, or the emerging memory feature. Some explanatory details are slightly condensed, but this keeps the text concise without sacrificing clarity. Therefore, information completeness is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core ideas of the original French text and uses generally appropriate terminology. However, several expressions feel literal or awkward, which affects readability and fluency. The translation would benefit from more idiomatic phrasing and a smoother narrative flow. Overall, it is a solid but improvable effort, suitable for a general audience familiar with AI concepts but not necessarily fluent in technical jargon. The average score across criteria is about 16/20, indicating a good but not perfect translation. The main improvements would focus on natural sentence structure and cultural adaptation to make the dialogue feel more native to Spanish speakers. The translator should review awkward verb forms, article usage, and the overall rhythm of the conversation to elevate the quality to a near-native level."
