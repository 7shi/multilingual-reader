  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the logical flow of the original script and uses clear, understandable language. Sentences are mostly straightforward and the concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in a way that is accessible to a general audience. However, some phrases feel slightly literal or clunky (e.g., “Lo han entendido todo”), which can momentarily distract the reader. Overall, the text is readable and comprehensible.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally smooth but contains a handful of unnatural or awkward expressions that a native speaker would find slightly off. Examples include the plural verb “Lo han entendido todo” (should be singular) and the phrase “El aprendizaje en contexto es como empollar” which is an imperfect idiomatic choice. The vocabulary is contemporary and appropriate, but a few grammatical tweaks would improve naturalness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\". The translation keeps the English acronyms (ICL) and provides their Spanish equivalents. No major terminology errors were found, and explanations are concise.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and humor of the original podcast are preserved. The translation adapts expressions to Spanish while maintaining the conversational tone appropriate for a podcast script. Minor cultural adjustments could enhance relatability (e.g., replacing “empollar” with a more common Spanish phrase), but the current version remains faithful to the source.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the French script is present in the Spanish translation. No key information was omitted or misrepresented. The translation also avoids unnecessary repetition and keeps the narrative concise. Therefore, the information completeness is excellent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation delivers a clear and faithful rendition of the original French podcast script. It accurately conveys the technical concepts and the conversational tone, making it suitable for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Minor grammatical and idiomatic adjustments would elevate the naturalness, but overall the translation is of high quality and effectively serves its intended purpose. The final score reflects strong performance across readability, fluency, terminology, contextual adaptation, and completeness, with slight room for improvement in natural language usage and cultural nuance. The translation is ready for use in a podcast or educational material aimed at Spanish‑speaking listeners, with a small polish to enhance flow and idiomatic expression. The final score out of 20 points is 16.4, indicating a well‑executed translation that meets most professional standards but could benefit from a final review for polish."
