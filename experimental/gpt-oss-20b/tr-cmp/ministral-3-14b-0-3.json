  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and closely mirrors the sentence structure of the French source. Complex ideas such as transfer learning and context‑window size are explained in plain language, making it accessible to a general audience. Minor spacing issues around quotation marks do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly overall, with natural phrasing and appropriate Spanish vocabulary. Some stylistic quirks—such as the comma after the opening quotation mark and the slightly abrupt exclamation “¡Lo olvida todo.”—could be polished, but they do not disrupt the flow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered (preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, anclaje) and remain consistent throughout the text. Explanatory paraphrases are provided where necessary, ensuring comprehension without over‑simplification.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent of the podcast script is preserved, and the Spanish version uses culturally neutral expressions that would resonate with Spanish‑speaking listeners. Adaptation is appropriate, though some localized idioms could have been added for extra flair.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant content is omitted; the dialogue’s flow and all technical points are intact. The translation keeps the conversation concise while covering every key concept from the original.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, maintaining clarity, naturalness, and technical accuracy. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve polish, but the text is ready for a native Spanish audience."
