    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the overall structure and most of the dialogue, so the narrative flow is mostly clear. However, several awkward or incorrect expressions (“el afino”, “ACL (In‑Context Learning)”, “Siéntale el sistema más inteligente”) break the natural rhythm and may confuse readers. The sentence construction is generally logical but these glitches reduce overall comprehensibility.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the majority of the text reads smoothly, there are several unnatural idioms and grammatical slips (“el afino”, “Siéntale el sistema más inteligente”, “aprenderá el francés a una velocidad increíble” – the latter is fine but the rest are odd). Vocabulary choices are generally appropriate, but some phrases feel translated literally rather than naturally, diminishing the native‑speaker feel.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “fine‑tuning” (as “ajuste fino” would be preferable), “aprendizaje en contexto” are present. However, inconsistencies and errors (“el afino”, “ACL” instead of ICL) weaken precision. “Grounding” is rendered as “enraizamiento”, which is understandable but not the most common term in Spanish AI discourse (usually “anclaje”). Overall terminology handling is acceptable but not perfect.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the show’s friendly tone and references (e.g., “desciframos la tecnología”, “Hola y bienvenido”), but a few culturally neutral choices (like “consultor” vs “asesor”) could be refined. The adaptation does not misrepresent the intent; however, the presence of literal translations and some awkward phrasing reduces cultural polish.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the original are present, and no critical content was omitted. Nonetheless, the erroneous phrase “Siéntale el sistema más inteligente” disrupts the intended meaning and may mislead readers. The rest of the content remains faithful and concise.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the overall message and structure well, but several linguistic inaccuracies and awkward phrasing detract from readability and naturalness. Refining the terminology, correcting obvious errors, and smoothing out idiomatic expressions would elevate the quality to a near‑native standard. It is functional for a general audience, but would benefit from a professional polish to ensure clarity and accuracy in a technical context."
