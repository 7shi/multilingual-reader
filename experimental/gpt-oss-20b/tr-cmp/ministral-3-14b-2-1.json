  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable for native speakers, but several fragments are disjointed or incomplete – e.g., the isolated line “Camille: sintaxis” and the placeholder “Luc: translation.” These interruptions break the flow and make it harder for readers to follow the dialogue. Additionally, the inserted explanatory note about *prompt* interrupts the natural narrative. Overall, the text is readable but contains noticeable gaps that affect comprehension.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences read smoothly, but some expressions feel mechanical or over‑explanatory. The use of parentheses and the inserted note about *prompt* feel like editorial comments rather than natural speech. Phrases such as \"vinculación a datos concretos\" or \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are accurate but sometimes clunky. Overall fluency is acceptable but not polished.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains key technical terms like *pretraining*, *fine‑tuning*, *ICL* and provides Spanish equivalents (*entrenamiento previo*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje en contexto*). The term *grounding* is rendered as \"vinculación a datos concretos,\" which is a good adaptation. However, inconsistencies appear (e.g., sometimes *prompt* is left in English, sometimes translated). Nonetheless, terminology is largely appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator attempts to adapt idiomatic expressions to Spanish, e.g., \"como si todo el contexto anterior se perdiera por completo.\" Cultural references remain intact, and the overall tone matches a conversational podcast. Nevertheless, the abrupt insertion of editorial notes and untranslated placeholders detracts from a smooth adaptation. The intent of the original is largely preserved, but some parts feel out of place for a Spanish audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several lines from the original French dialogue are missing or replaced by placeholders (e.g., “Luc: translation”). The isolated line “Camille: sintaxis” appears out of context. While most concepts are present, the omission of certain exchanges means the translation is not fully complete. The missing content reduces the overall fidelity of the episode. Consequently, the translation fails to convey all the information presented in the original.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the general sense of the French original and retains most technical terminology. However, the presence of gaps, editorial notes, and a few unnatural phrasings lowers its overall quality. It is understandable for a native Spanish speaker, but it is not a flawless, polished version. For a professional podcast transcript, further editing is recommended to remove placeholders, smooth the language, and ensure all dialogue is present and coherent. The final score is a weighted average of the individual criteria, resulting in a moderate overall quality. The translation can serve as a solid draft, but it needs refinement to reach a high‑quality standard. The proposed overall score is 12/20, reflecting that the work is competent but has significant room for improvement."
