  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and follows the original storyline, but some sentence structures feel overly literal and a few phrases (e.g., “El ajuste fino, o 'fine-tuning', es en este punto donde…”) are awkward. Overall, readers can grasp the content, though a few complex ideas could be simplified further.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural expressions, repetitive phrasing, and occasional grammatical slips. While it sounds mostly natural, the frequent mix of English terms and the literal rendering of dialogues make the text feel somewhat stilted. Minor adjustments would improve its smoothness.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, and *aprendizaje en contexto* are generally used correctly. However, the acronym ICL is left untranslated, and the English word “grounding” is partially retained. Consistency could be improved, but the core terminology is adequate.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation stays faithful to the original context and cultural references, yet some local nuances are missed. The literal approach sometimes leads to less idiomatic phrasing, and there is little effort to adapt expressions to Spanish‑speaking cultural expectations.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French source are present, with no significant omissions. Minor details such as the precise explanation of ICL or the function of grounding could be expanded for clarity, but redundancy is largely avoided.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "La traducción presenta un buen nivel de comprensión y una cobertura completa del contenido original. Sin embargo, se perciben expresiones demasiado literales y algunos errores de fluidez que dificultan la lectura natural. Con ajustes menores de estilo y terminología, la pieza alcanzaría un nivel de calidad superior para el público hispanohablante."
