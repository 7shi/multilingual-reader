  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely easy to follow and the conversation structure is preserved. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., “Lo han entendido todo” instead of “Lo has entendido todo”) slightly reduce clarity, but overall the flow remains understandable.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is fluent in most parts, but a handful of phrases sound unnatural to native Spanish speakers (e.g., “Lo han entendido todo”, “La IA lo olvida todo”, “las leyes de la balanza”). These quirks slightly impede smooth reading.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, etc., are correctly rendered and consistently used. Minor issues include the mistranslation of ‘antisèche’ and the incorrect phrase ‘las leyes de la balanza’ which should be ‘las leyes del equilibrio’.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the conversational tone and references relevant to Spanish-speaking audiences. Cultural nuances are largely respected, though some expressions (e.g., “las leyes de la balanza”) reflect literal rather than idiomatic usage. Overall, the adaptation is good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No major information is omitted; all key points from the original dialogue are present. The narrative continuity is maintained, and the added contextual notes (e.g., about the memory feature) remain faithful. Small redundancy issues are minimal.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation faithfully conveys the main ideas of the original French script and maintains a conversational style. Minor grammatical and idiomatic errors slightly detract from fluency and clarity, but the overall quality is solid. With a few adjustments—particularly around article usage, idiomatic expressions, and the correct rendering of technical terms—this would be an excellent translation for Spanish-speaking audiences interested in AI technology discussions. The translation demonstrates a strong grasp of both linguistic nuance and technical content, making it suitable for general consumption while preserving the speaker’s intended tone and intent. The final score reflects these strengths and the small areas for improvement, indicating a competent but not perfect translation overall."
