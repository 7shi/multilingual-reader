    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely comprehensible, with clear dialogue and logical sentence flow. However, a few awkward constructions (e.g., \"Imaginen que enviamos una IA totalmente nueva a la escuela\") and inconsistent capitalization reduce overall readability. Minor typos (\"de la Universidad\" instead of \"de la universidad\") also affect clarity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly in many places, but several phrases feel forced or incorrect for native speakers: \"Imaginen que enviamos…\", \"El afinamiento…\", and the repeated exclamation “¡Exactamente!”. The use of the future subjunctive in \"no enseñaríais…\" is unidiomatic, and some grammatical errors (missing accents, incorrect verb forms) disrupt the natural flow. The overall fluency is acceptable but not native‑level quality.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms are mostly preserved: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", \"Memoria\". Yet inconsistencies arise: \"afinamiento\" is used instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\", and \"Aprendizaje Contextual Instruccional (ICL)\" misrepresents the original acronym. Terminology is generally appropriate but would benefit from uniformity and more accurate equivalents.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content well for a Spanish‑speaking audience, maintaining the conversational tone and cultural references. Minor adjustments could improve cultural relevance (e.g., phrasing about consultants), but overall the intent and purpose are preserved without significant loss.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. However, the shift from \"In‑Context Learning (ICL)\" to \"Aprendizaje Contextual Instruccional\" introduces slight ambiguity, and a few explanatory nuances are missing (e.g., the explanation of how prompts embed past information). Redundancies are minimal, but some detail could be refined.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the essential ideas and overall flow of the original French dialogue, yet it suffers from several linguistic inaccuracies and terminology inconsistencies. It is intelligible and largely faithful, but not yet polished to a native‑speaker level. With targeted edits—especially around terminology consistency, natural phrasing, and minor grammatical corrections—the quality could rise to a near‑perfect standard. Overall, a solid first draft that needs refinement for professional publication or academic use. 16/20 points overall. 16"
