    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable, but a few sentences feel a bit awkward or overly literal (e.g., “entendiste todo” instead of a smoother phrasing). The structure follows the original, so readers can follow the flow, but a few places could benefit from clearer wording or shorter sentences to aid comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural expressions and slightly clunky phrasing, especially where the original French idioms were rendered word‑for‑word. Examples include “la IA no se perfecciona” and “Inteligencia Computacional Limitada” for ICL. The overall flow is acceptable, but the text does not sound fully natural to a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly translated (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, anclaje). However, the abbreviation ICL was misinterpreted as “Inteligencia Computacional Limitada” instead of the correct “Aprendizaje en Contexto”. This inconsistency reduces the precision of the terminology.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the intent and humor of the original dialogue, but it occasionally lacks cultural adaptation, particularly in the use of formal vs informal register and the mishandling of ICL. Some expressions feel literal rather than adapted to Spanish-speaking audiences.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present, and no significant content was omitted. Minor details such as the exact wording of the ICL explanation are slightly altered, but overall the translation remains faithful to the source material.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely understandable and covers the same information as the original French text. However, it suffers from occasional literal renderings, awkward phrasing, and a key terminology mistake regarding ICL. A revision focusing on natural phrasing and correcting the terminology would raise the overall quality significantly. The current version scores 70/100, reflecting competent but improvable translation work."
