    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, but frequent omissions (e.g., the stray \"pre-entrenamiento\" lines), incomplete sentences, and missing context make it difficult for a reader to follow the dialogue smoothly. 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several grammatical mistakes, awkward word choices (e.g., \"El IA\", \"proporcionárselas\"), and unnatural phrasing. 10/20.",

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered (e.g., \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"fine-tuning\" as \"especialización\"). However, inconsistencies appear (e.g., \"mémoire\" left untranslated, \"Conocimientos\" missing article). 13/20.",

    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue keeps the original intent and cultural references, but some elements (e.g., title mismatch, missing adaptation of brand names) reduce effectiveness. 14/20.",

    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Key parts of the original script are omitted or misrepresented, especially the initial lines and the ending reference to the podcast title. 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is a solid draft that captures most of the content, but it is undermined by several grammatical errors, missing sections, and inconsistent terminology. It would benefit from a thorough proofreading and correction of omitted lines to improve clarity and completeness."
