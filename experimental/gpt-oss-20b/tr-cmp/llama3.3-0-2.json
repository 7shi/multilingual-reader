  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation preserves the logical flow of the original French text. Sentences are mostly short and clearly structured, making complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning accessible to a general audience. Only a few minor punctuation errors (e.g., missing spaces before punctuation) distract from overall comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The language feels natural for native Spanish speakers. Vocabulary choices are appropriate, and the text reads smoothly. Minor awkward phrasings—such as “Se tiene la impresión” instead of “Se da la impresión” or “aprender en contexto” instead of “aprender en contexto” (duplicate wording)—do not hinder understanding but slightly reduce the native feel.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\" for fine‑tuning, \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\". Consistency is maintained throughout, and explanations accompany terms where necessary. One could argue for \"ajuste fino\" instead of \"afinamiento\", but the chosen term is still widely understood in Spanish technical contexts.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts idiomatic expressions to Spanish (e.g., \"la IA hace lo mismo\", \"el aprendizaje por transferencia\"), respecting cultural context and avoiding literal carry‑overs that might feel odd. Minor opportunities for tighter localization (e.g., using \"el fin de semana\" instead of \"las últimas semanas\") exist but do not compromise clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All substantive content from the French original is present. No key points are omitted, and the narrative structure remains intact. The translation preserves the dialogue's rhythm and does not add extraneous information, maintaining conciseness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation demonstrates a strong grasp of both the source material and the target language. While there are a few minor stylistic hiccups, the overall readability, fluency, technical accuracy, and contextual appropriateness are high. The final product is clear, natural, and faithful to the original intent, making it suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience familiar with AI concepts. The translation could benefit from a final proofreading round to polish the few lingering awkward phrasing and punctuation issues, but it is already of excellent quality.\n\nOverall Score: 18/20"
