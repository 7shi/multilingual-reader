    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the conversational style of the original. Sentence structure is mostly logical, and explanations of complex concepts are clear. However, some sentences are long and a few phrases are redundant or awkward, slightly reducing readability.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation flows well in most places, but there are several unnatural constructions and minor grammatical errors (e.g., “Luc destaca:” instead of simply “Luc”, incorrect hyphenation, inconsistent use of “aprender en contexto” vs. “aprendizaje contextual”). These issues interrupt the naturalness of the dialogue for a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely correct: “preentrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning” → “afinado”, “transfer learning” → “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “in‑context learning” → “aprendizaje en contexto”. Some terms were repeated or slightly mis‑spelled (“afinanción”), but overall consistency is good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original to Spanish culture fairly well, using idiomatic expressions and appropriate references. The addition of brief explanatory sentences helps comprehension but occasionally feels slightly redundant. The intent and tone of the podcast dialogue are preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all original content is retained; the conversation flow, key points on pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, and memory features are present. Minor omissions are negligible, and no significant new content that would mislead the reader.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is overall competent, capturing the main ideas and maintaining a conversational tone. Some grammatical and stylistic glitches reduce fluency, and a few terminology slips appear, but the content remains clear and complete. With a few edits for naturalness, it would be an excellent localized version of the original French podcast script."
