  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally easy to follow and the sentence structure is logical. However, a few sentences are slightly awkward (e.g., \"El ajuste fino… ¿Es allí donde interviene…?\"), and the repetition of \"Aprendizaje en contexto\" in the same line reduces flow. Overall, the text is comprehensible for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly in most places, but there are minor unnatural expressions such as the repeated phrase \"Aprendizaje en contexto\" and the use of a hyphen in \"pre-entrenamiento\" which is not common in Spanish. The punctuation also contains a stray question mark in a statement. These issues slightly detract from a native‑speaker’s naturalness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly translated (preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding -> anclaje, memory -> memoria). The terminology is consistent throughout and is appropriate for a general audience. Only a very small inconsistency in the hyphen usage of pre-entrenamiento, but this does not affect understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects cultural conventions (opening with \"Hola y bienvenidos\", maintaining the brand name \"Tech Éclair\"). The expressions are adapted for Spanish listeners while preserving the original intent. Minor improvements could be made to avoid literal translations of some idioms, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present. No essential information is omitted, and the flow of the conversation is maintained. The translation even adds a slightly more natural phrasing in some places. No redundant content that would obscure meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the content, tone, and intent of the French original. Minor stylistic tweaks and punctuation corrections would raise it to a near‑perfect level, but it is already suitable for a native audience. Overall score: 86/100 (approx. 17/20)."
