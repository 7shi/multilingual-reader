  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version presents the ideas in clear, straightforward sentences that most Spanish‑speaking readers can follow. The complex concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained without unnecessary jargon, and the dialogue flow remains logical. Minor sentence length variations do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads largely naturally for a native Spanish speaker, with appropriate verb tenses and consistent phrasing. Some awkwardness appears in a few expressions – e.g., \"la IA no se fine‑tune constantemente con sus conversaciones\" and \"en el sentido humano del término\" – which could be phrased more idiomatically. Overall, the fluency is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL). The translator retains English acronyms where appropriate and provides enough context for each term. Minor inconsistencies in the use of the abbreviation \"ICL\" could be addressed, but overall terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the conversational tone and cultural references suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Expressions such as \"consultor brillante\" or the bicycle analogy resonate culturally. The adaptation could improve on idiomatic phrasing in a few spots, yet the overall intent and purpose of the original are effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French transcript are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is omitted, and the added explanations for terms aid understanding. Redundancy is minimal and the content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely accurate, readable, and faithful to the original French transcript. While minor fluency issues exist, the overall quality is high, and the translation serves its purpose well for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The scores reflect a solid performance with room for slight refinement in naturalness and idiomatic expression. Overall rating: 17/20 on average across criteria (85/100)."
