    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and follows a logical sentence structure. Most ideas are expressed in an easily comprehensible way, and long sentences are occasionally broken up to aid understanding. Minor readability issues arise in a few places where the flow could be smoother, but overall the text remains accessible to a general Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for native speakers. Word choice and grammar are mostly appropriate, and the dialogue flows smoothly. A few phrases feel slightly literal or could be rendered more colloquially (e.g., \"La IA no ha « olvidado »…\" could be \"La IA no ha olvidado…\"), yet the overall tone is conversational and engaging.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are translated correctly and consistently: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, ventana de contexto, anclaje. The term \"grounding\" is rendered as \"anclaje,\" which is acceptable in the context. No major terminology errors are present, though some could be further localized (e.g., \"memoria\" could be \"memoria contextual\" to highlight its feature).",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is adapted for Spanish speakers, using idiomatic expressions and maintaining the conversational style of the original podcast. Cultural references are minimal and effectively translated, and the overall intent of the dialogue is preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No important content has been omitted, and the translation remains concise while preserving the nuances of the discussion.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation of the French podcast script is of high quality. It retains the original meaning, maintains a conversational tone, and uses appropriate technical terminology. Minor improvements could be made in readability and natural phrasing, but these do not detract significantly from the overall effectiveness of the translation. The translation is suitable for a native Spanish audience and successfully conveys the intent and details of the original dialogue."
