  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version uses clear sentence structures and logical flow, making the content easy to understand. Minor issues like the missing accent on \"última hora\" or a slightly awkward word order in a couple of places do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall, the text reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker. The use of English terms such as \"prompt\" and \"ICL\" is acceptable in tech contexts. Minor stylistic quirks – e.g., \"Se puede decir eso\" and the typo \"partes\" instead of \"parte\" – are the only points that slightly detract from full naturalness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: \"pré-entraînement\" → \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"affinage\" → \"afinamiento\", \"apprentissage par transfert\" → \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"apprentissage en contexte\" → \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\". The chosen terms are appropriate for the target audience and remain faithful to the original.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts idiomatic expressions well, e.g., \"consultor brillante\" and the comparison to a bicycle lesson. Cultural references are retained accurately, and the tone remains conversational as in the source. No unnecessary cultural adjustments are made, keeping the original intent intact.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the original is preserved. No key information is omitted, and the structure of dialogue is maintained. Redundancy is minimal and the text remains concise while fully conveying the intended meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is highly faithful, clear, and natural. It maintains the technical precision and conversational tone of the original French text while adapting it smoothly to Spanish. Minor linguistic tweaks could enhance fluidity, but overall it is an excellent rendition suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience familiar with AI terminology."
