    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and easy to follow. Simple sentence structures and logical flow allow most readers to grasp the concepts. Minor issues arise in a few places where terminology is confused (e.g., \"AIC\" instead of \"ICL\"), which can momentarily disrupt understanding, but overall the content is comprehensible.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is fluent overall, with native‑like diction and a smooth narrative. However, some awkward choices appear, such as \"encadenamiento\" and the phrase \"el sistema busca rápidamente en tus intercambios anteriores la información que parece relevante\" which feels slightly clunky. These do not break understanding, but they reduce the naturalness compared to a polished copy.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"transfer learning\" (translated as \"aprendizaje por transferencia\"), and \"grounding\" as \"fondeo\". The major issue is the mis‑translation of \"ICL\" as \"AIC (Aprendizaje Interactivo Contextual)\", which is not a standard term and could confuse readers. Aside from that, terminology remains consistent and appropriate for a general audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural adaptation is largely unnecessary for the target audience, and the translator kept the informal style of the podcast dialogue. Minor adaptation choices—such as using \"ventana de contexto\" instead of a literal translation of \"context window\"—are acceptable. The overall cultural fit is good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present. No significant content is omitted. The mis‑named \"AIC\" is the only potential source of confusion but does not remove information. Redundancies are minimal, and the text remains concise while keeping the original's detail.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the original meaning and conversational style fairly well. It excels in readability and overall content coverage, but suffers from a notable terminology error—mislabeling \"ICL\" as \"AIC\"—which could mislead readers. Additionally, a few phrases are slightly awkward, reducing fluency. With minor corrections to the terminology and a few phrasing tweaks, the translation would reach a high standard of quality for native Spanish speakers."
