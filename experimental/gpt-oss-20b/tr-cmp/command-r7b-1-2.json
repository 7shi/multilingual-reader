    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version retains the conversational flow of the original dialogue. Sentence structures are mostly clear and easy to follow. However, some literal translations (e.g., *‘Aprendizaje contextual, es memoria de estudios’*) are confusing for native readers, and a few phrases (like *‘la IA se olvidaba todo’* in the original but omitted here) are missing or mis‑rendered. Overall, the text is readable but could benefit from smoothing a few expressions.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural, but there are several awkward or literal phrasings that interrupt the flow. Examples include *‘Aprendizaje contextual, es memoria de estudios’* (unnatural), *‘entras una nueva ventana’* instead of *‘abrir una nueva ventana’*, and *‘tras bambalinas’* which feels odd in this context. Vocabulary is generally appropriate, but the overall rhythm is slightly stilted.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are generally correctly translated: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *ICL*. However, the translation of *grounding* as *encaje* is incorrect; a better choice would be *anclaje* or *fundamentación*. The term *memoria* is used inconsistently and sometimes lacks context. Terminology consistency could be improved.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator captures the informal tone and the podcast style well. Cultural references (consultor brillante, ventana de contexto) are appropriate for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Some expressions such as *‘se ha vaciado’* convey the intended meaning, but a few literal translations (e.g., *‘la IA se olvidaba todo’* omitted) reduce the naturalness of the dialogue. Overall, contextual adaptation is solid but not perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original dialogue are present, including the explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. Minor omissions or slight paraphrasing do not alter the overall meaning. Redundancy is minimal and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is generally faithful to the original French text and conveys the main ideas clearly. However, several awkward phrasings, terminology inaccuracies, and a few literal translations detract from its naturalness and readability. With some polishing—especially in terminology and flow—the translation could reach a higher level of quality. Currently, it stands as a solid, but not perfect, rendition suitable for a general audience familiar with podcasting and AI concepts. The overall quality score is 78 out of 100 points, reflecting a good but improvable translation effort. The translator should focus on refining terminology consistency, smoothing out literal phrases, and ensuring each sentence reads naturally for native Spanish speakers to achieve a higher level of fluency and precision. This will result in a more engaging and authoritative final product."
