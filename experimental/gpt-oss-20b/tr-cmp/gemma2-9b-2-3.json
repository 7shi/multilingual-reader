    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally understandable, but several sentences are awkwardly constructed or overly literal. For example, “Imagínese que se le da a una nueva IA en la escuela” is a strange construction that could confuse readers. Repeated use of “El” at the start of many lines makes the flow feel choppy. Nevertheless, the overall structure follows the original dialogue and readers can follow the concepts, so it scores 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most of the vocabulary is appropriate, the text contains several unnatural phrasings (“se le da a una nueva IA en la escuela”, “en la escuela”) and missing punctuation (e.g., missing inverted exclamation marks in some places). The repeated use of the definite article at the start of many sentences also hampers smoothness. Consequently, fluency is moderately low, earning 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, y memoria a corto plazo are correctly rendered. However, the translation keeps the French word *ancrage* and the English word “grounding” untranslated, which weakens consistency. The term ICL is also presented with its full Spanish translation in parentheses, which is acceptable but could be clearer. Overall, the terminology is largely accurate, meriting 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator mostly preserves the informal, conversational tone of the original interview, but some cultural adjustments are missing or awkward. The phrase “en la escuela” does not naturally convey the intended meaning in Spanish. Additionally, the use of bilingual parentheses (ancrage (grounding)) distracts from a fully localized style. The adaptation is competent but not optimal, scoring 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, temporary vs. permanent knowledge, and the memory feature. Minor explanatory details are retained, and no substantial information is omitted. A few repetitive sentences appear, but they do not hinder comprehension. This criterion earns 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is broadly faithful to the source and conveys the core ideas, but it suffers from several linguistic inaccuracies and awkward phrasings that reduce readability and fluency. Technical terminology is largely correct, though a few terms remain untranslated. Cultural adaptation is decent but could be polished further. Overall, the translation is usable but would benefit from a more natural rewrite and careful editing of recurring linguistic quirks. Overall score: 15/20."
