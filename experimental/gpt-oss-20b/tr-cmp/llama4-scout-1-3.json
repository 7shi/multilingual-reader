    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish transcript is largely understandable, but several sentences are awkward or fragmented. Pronoun usage (‘Usted lo ha entendido todo’) feels literal and a bit stiff, and a few lines contain unnecessary fragments (e.g., the “La traducción es:” comments). Overall, a native reader can follow the dialogue but would notice these small breaks in flow.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Naturalness suffers in several spots: direct translations of French idioms such as ‘Usted lo ha entendido todo’ or the inserted meta‑commentary ‘La traducción es:’ break the rhythm. Verb tenses and prepositions are generally correct, but word order in some sentences feels off. The text feels conversational but not fully smooth.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: ‘pre‑entrenamiento’, ‘ajuste fino’, ‘aprendizaje por transferencia’, ‘ventana de contexto’, ‘anclaje’. Consistency is good, though a few terms (e.g., ‘grounding’ translated as ‘anclaje’ in one place but not elsewhere) could be uniform. Overall, terminology is suitable for a general tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the casual, podcast tone and references to everyday experience, which fits Spanish‑speaking listeners. Cultural references are minimal, so no major issues. However, some literal phrasing and the accidental insertion of explanatory comments reduce contextual polish.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is present, but a few lines are slightly altered or duplicated (e.g., the ‘La traducción es’ fragment). No major ideas are omitted, though a few sentences are redundant or incomplete, slightly reducing conciseness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the main ideas and maintains the conversational style of the original French podcast. Nonetheless, it contains several awkward phrasings, a few literal or incomplete translations, and extraneous commentary that disrupts fluency. With some smoothing of sentence structure and removal of unnecessary inserts, the text would read naturally for a native audience."
