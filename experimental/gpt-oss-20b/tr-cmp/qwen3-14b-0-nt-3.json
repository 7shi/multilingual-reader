    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation follows the original structure closely and most sentences are easy to understand. Minor issues – such as the abrupt shift to formal “Usted” and a few awkward phrasings – slightly interrupt the flow, but the overall content remains logically organized and comprehensible for a native speaker.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads largely smoothly, but several natural‑language errors weaken its fluency: missing accent marks (e.g., “¿Porque” → “¿Por qué?”), a misplaced comma after “el aprendizaje en contexto”, and the use of formal “Usted” in a conversational context. These reduce the overall naturalness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core terms such as \"pré-entraînement\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"apprentissage par transfert\", \"fenêtre de contexte\" and \"ICL\" are correctly rendered. However, the concept of grounding was left as the French word \"ancrage\" in quotes instead of the Spanish equivalent \"anclaje\", and some technical phrases (e.g., \"in‑context learning\" → \"aprendizaje en contexto\") could be polished further. Consistency is mostly maintained but not optimal.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the informal, back‑and‑forth tone of the podcast and adapts cultural references (e.g., swapping \"consultant\" for a more everyday figure). Nonetheless, the formal pronoun “Usted” in several places feels out of place in a casual chat between two peers. A more consistent conversational register would improve the adaptation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all content from the original French text is present, including the detailed explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning. Minor omissions are negligible (e.g., a missing accent or a slightly altered phrase). The translation therefore remains largely complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the core ideas of the French original and preserves its conversational flow, but several linguistic and terminological issues detract from its overall quality. The main problems are the use of a formal register in an informal context, missing accent marks, a comma in an unexpected place, and the retention of a French technical term that should be translated. With these corrections, the translation would reach a higher standard of naturalness and accuracy. Overall, the translation is competent but would benefit from a more careful editing pass to address the noted flaws and to ensure consistent terminology throughout the text. It effectively communicates the original content while leaving room for refinement to achieve native‑level fluency and precision in terminology usage. A modest overall score of 15/20 reflects the solid foundation of the translation with room for improvement in polish and consistency. This assessment takes into account all five evaluation criteria, offering a balanced view of readability, fluency, terminology, contextual adaptation, and information completeness."
