    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version keeps the dialogue structure and most sentences are understandable. However, several typographical and grammatical errors (e.g., “¿Porque” instead of “¿Por qué”, missing accents, use of a slash in “bienvenido/a”) hinder smooth reading. The flow is logical, but the errors affect clarity slightly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text mostly reads smoothly, but there are unnatural phrases such as “¿Porque ya comprende” and the inconsistent use of “ICl” instead of “ICL”. Some word choices (e.g., “perfeccionamiento” for fine‑tuning, “ventana de contexto” incorrectly inverted) sound less idiomatic. Overall, the translation feels only moderately fluent.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely correct: pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, memoria a corto plazo. Minor inconsistencies appear (e.g., “perfeccionamiento” vs the more common “ajuste fino”, “ventana de contexto” inverted). Nevertheless, the terminology is appropriate and mostly consistent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the informal tone and added culturally familiar expressions (e.g., “¡Gracias por escucharnos!”). Some cultural nuances were missed – the gendered “bienvenido/a” is awkward in Spanish. Still, the overall intent and purpose of the podcast episode are well conveyed.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No substantive content was omitted; all dialogues are present. The translation does not add unnecessary repetition and remains concise. The only concern is missing accents that could confuse readers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the main ideas and dialogue flow of the original French script, but it suffers from several grammatical and typographical errors that affect readability and fluency. Terminology is mostly accurate, though a few terms could be rendered more idiomatically. Cultural adaptation is adequate but could be refined (e.g., gendered greetings). Overall, it is a decent translation but would benefit from proofreading and minor style adjustments."
