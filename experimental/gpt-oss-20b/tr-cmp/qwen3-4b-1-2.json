  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to read, but several sentences feel a bit forced—e.g., *“Imagínate que se envía una IA completamente nueva…”* and *“aparecer una prueba de fuego”*. A few typos (e.g., *conocenes* instead of *conocimientos*) and missing accents slightly hinder flow. Overall, however, listeners can follow the dialogue without major confusion.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text mostly sounds natural, yet there are several grammatical slips and unnatural word choices: *le darle* instead of *le dar*, *aparecer una prueba de fuego* instead of *dar una anverso* or *apuntes*, and missing accents. These affect smoothness but do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly translated—*preentrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *in‑context learning (ICL)*, *anclaje*—and the terminology is consistent throughout. The only slip is the typo *conocenes*.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation to Spanish culture is adequate; idiomatic expressions are used appropriately, though the phrase *prueba de fuego* feels off. The overall intent and tone of the podcast are maintained, and the script feels conversational for a Spanish audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No substantive content was omitted. All key ideas—pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory features—are present, and the dialogue structure is preserved. Minor repetition exists but does not detract from clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and mostly faithful to the original French script. It communicates the concepts clearly and retains the conversational tone suitable for a Spanish‑speaking podcast. Small errors in wording, grammar, and typos slightly reduce readability and fluency, but these are easily corrected. Overall, the translation meets professional standards with room for minor polishing."
