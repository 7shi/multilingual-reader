  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version reads smoothly for a native audience. Sentences are logically ordered and complex ideas are broken down with clear examples. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., “Los nueva conocimientos”) do not hinder comprehension, but overall the text is easy to follow.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text feels natural and conversational. Occasional awkward phrasings—such as “Ya había escuchado ese término” and the use of guillemets for quotation marks—are minor and do not disrupt flow. Vocabulary choices are appropriate for a general audience, though some technical terms could be further polished.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are consistently translated (preentrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL). The only inconsistency is the grammatical error “Los nueva conocimientos”, which should read “Los nuevos conocimientos”. Overall, terminology is accurate and well adapted to the target readership.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original intent and style. Cultural references are handled appropriately for a Spanish-speaking audience. Minor opportunities for further localization (e.g., replacing “prompt” with a more common Spanish term) exist, but they do not detract from the message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All main points from the French original are present. No critical information is omitted, and the Spanish version does not introduce unnecessary redundancy. It remains concise while retaining clarity.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid, faithfully conveying the original content with good readability and fluency. Small grammatical corrections and a touch more natural phrasing would elevate it to near‑perfect quality, but it is already functional and well‑adapted for a Spanish audience."
