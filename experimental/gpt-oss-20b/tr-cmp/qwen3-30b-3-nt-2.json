  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely intelligible and follows the same logical flow as the original. The sentences are long but still understandable; however, a few phrasing choices (e.g., “se expandió masivamente la memoria a corto plazo”) are slightly awkward for native readers. Overall, readability is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most of the text reads smoothly, there are several instances of unnatural phrasing and minor grammatical errors (e.g., “I” instead of “IA”, missing accents, overly literal verb choices). The flow could be improved with more idiomatic Spanish, but the translation is still comprehensible.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly—\"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\" (as \"refinamiento\"), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"in‑context learning\" (ICL), and \"anclaje\" are used appropriately. Consistency is largely maintained, although occasional lapses in using the abbreviation \"IA\" versus \"I\" create minor confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references are adapted sensibly (e.g., describing the AI as a “consultor brillante”). Some expressions could be more natural, but overall the adaptation suits a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present; nothing significant is omitted. The translation includes the same details about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, and memory features. No redundant content, and the information remains concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and largely faithful to the source text. It preserves the core technical concepts and conversational style, though there are minor issues with naturalness and consistency in terminology usage. With a few refinements to phrasing and a stricter application of the AI abbreviation, the translation would reach a higher level of polish. Overall, it is a solid, understandable rendition suitable for Spanish‑speaking audiences familiar with AI terminology. The average score reflects these strengths and weaknesses at roughly 16/20, indicating good quality with room for improvement in fluency and consistency.\n\nThe provided scores for each criterion sum to 82, yielding an average of 16.4, rounded to 16/20 for the overall assessment.\n\n"
