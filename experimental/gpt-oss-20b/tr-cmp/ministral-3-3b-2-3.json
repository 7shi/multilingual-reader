  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version largely follows the original structure, but many lines are interrupted by editorial notes (e.g., *Improved translation (based on context of learning transfer…)*). These notes break the flow and make it harder for a reader to follow the dialogue. Sentence length is generally acceptable, yet the abrupt insertion of comments reduces overall comprehensibility.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall tone is quite mechanical; many sentences feel clunky or overly literal (e.g., *Camille: El pre‑entrenamiento (o entrenamiento previo si se prefiere mayor claridad)…*). The translation also mixes explanatory asides with dialogue, which creates awkward pauses. Vocabulary is mostly correct but the cadence lacks the smoothness expected of a native‑speaking podcast script.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *aprendizaje por transferencia* and *In‑Context Learning* are present, but inconsistencies appear (e.g., *ICL* is left untranslated, *grounding* sometimes stays in English). The translator occasionally adds clarifying remarks, which is good, but the mix of English and Spanish terms can confuse readers who rely on consistent terminology.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to adapt cultural references (e.g., *Tech Éclair* → *Tecno Relámpago*), but the inserted editorial comments interfere with the intended message. The original conversational tone is somewhat preserved, yet the additional explanatory sections detract from the context‑specific flow expected in a podcast transcript.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is present; the translator retains the main storyline and concepts. However, the inclusion of numerous notes and occasional omissions of fine details (e.g., the exact phrasing of *grounding*) slightly diminish completeness. The dialogue still conveys the core ideas, but some contextual nuance is lost or buried in the comments.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers the main ideas and maintains the dialogue structure, but it is heavily punctuated by editorial notes that disrupt readability and flow. The language is technically correct but lacks the natural cadence expected of a polished Spanish podcast script. Consistency of terminology could be improved, and contextual adaptation would benefit from removing the inserted asides. Overall, the translation is functional but requires refinement to reach a professional level of polish and clarity for native listeners.\n\nScore: 12 out of 20 (average of the five criteria)."
