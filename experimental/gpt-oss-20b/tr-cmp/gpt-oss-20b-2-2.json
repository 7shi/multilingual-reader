  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely understandable and follows the narrative flow of the original. Most sentences are short and coherent, and the speaker roles are clearly indicated. Minor issues such as missing spaces or slightly awkward word order (e.g., \"«ventana de contexto\"\", \"es toda la potencia de esta forma\") do not impede comprehension. The explanation of complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) is conveyed in a way that a Spanish‑speaking audience can follow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly overall, with appropriate verb forms and tense usage. However, there are a few phrases that feel slightly literal or clunky, such as \"¿Es decir?\", \"es toda la potencia de esta forma\", \"sillón\" instead of \"silla\", and some missing accents. The use of French terms in parentheses (e.g., \"ancrage (grounding)\") and the occasional direct transliteration of English terms (e.g., \"preentrenamiento\") also affect naturalness. Nevertheless, these do not severely disrupt fluency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled mostly correctly. Terms like \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL), \"grounding\", and \"memoria\" are either translated or appropriately kept in English when they are widely used in the Spanish AI community. Consistency is maintained throughout the script. Minor improvements could include using \"finetuning\" or \"ajuste fino\" consistently and providing a brief Spanish definition for terms introduced for the first time.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and humor of the dialogue. Cultural references are adequately adapted (e.g., the consultant analogy works in Spanish). The dialogue keeps the same register (informal, conversational) and the pacing is maintained. Some idiomatic expressions could be slightly refined (e.g., \"¿Es decir?\" → \"¿Qué significa?\") to match native usage, but overall the adaptation is faithful.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No content has been omitted, and the logical progression of ideas (pre‑training → fine‑tuning → in‑context learning → memory features) is intact. The Spanish version also includes the final takeaway question. The script remains concise and avoids unnecessary repetition, so the information completeness is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality. It successfully conveys the technical concepts and conversational tone of the original French podcast script. While there are a few minor linguistic and typographical issues that could be smoothed out, the translation is clear, natural, and largely faithful to the source. The main strengths lie in the faithful preservation of terminology and context, as well as maintaining a readable and engaging dialogue. Small edits—especially around idiomatic phrasing and consistent spacing—would elevate the translation to near‑perfect status. Overall, the script is ready for use in a Spanish‑speaking audience with minimal polishing required."
