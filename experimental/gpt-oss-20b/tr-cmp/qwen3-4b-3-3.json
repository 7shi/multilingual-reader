  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely understandable; most sentences flow logically and convey the core ideas. However, typographical errors such as “francque” instead of “francés” and inconsistent verb forms (e.g., “aprendra” vs. “aprende”) create small comprehension hurdles, slightly reducing overall readability.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the translator has kept many expressions natural, the presence of several awkward constructions (e.g., “se ataque a la mecánica cuántica”, “precibido”, “Usted ha entendido” in a casual podcast setting) and grammatical slips (missing accents, wrong verb forms) interrupt the smooth flow expected from a native speaker. These issues lower the overall fluency score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *ventana de contexto*, and *anclaje* are accurately rendered and consistently used throughout the text. Minor inconsistencies arise only in capitalization or the retention of English terms, but these do not compromise understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts many colloquial French expressions into Spanish equivalents and adds culturally relevant phrasing. Nevertheless, some choices feel slightly formal (use of “usted” in a relaxed podcast), and a few literal renderings (“se ataque a la mecánica cuántica”) feel awkward for Spanish speakers, slightly diminishing contextual fidelity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present in the Spanish version. The translation does not omit any major idea, and redundant phrases are minimized. Minor typographical errors do not change the meaning but do affect clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in conveying the original meaning and technical content, with clear terminology and a solid grasp of the overall message. However, typographical mistakes, occasional grammatical slips, and slightly unnatural phrasing reduce the text’s readability and naturalness. With minor corrections, the translation would reach a higher quality level suitable for a native Spanish‑speaking audience in a podcast setting."
