  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, but a few small errors (e.g., duplicate speaker labels, missing accents, and slightly awkward phrasing) make the text less smooth. Overall, readers can follow the narrative without major difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the translation conveys the meaning, it contains several unnatural expressions and grammatical slips (e.g., “Mire:”, “Porque”, missing accents). A native speaker would find the flow a bit jarring, but it is not prohibitively difficult.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje. The terminology is consistent and appropriate for a general audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation keeps the intent and style of a casual podcast, using colloquial Spanish and preserving the friendly tone. Cultural references are appropriate, though some phrasing could be slightly refined.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All main points from the original French text are present; no significant content is omitted. Minor redundancies exist (e.g., repeated speaker labels), but they do not detract from comprehension.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation faithfully conveys the original content and technical concepts, but it falls short in fluency and readability due to a handful of grammatical errors and slightly awkward phrasing. The terminology is solid and consistent, and the contextual adaptation is generally effective. Overall, it is a competent translation that would benefit from a final proof‑read to polish the language and remove small mistakes. Score: 84/100 (out of 100)."
