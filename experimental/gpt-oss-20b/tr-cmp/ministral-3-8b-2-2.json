  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to follow; the sentences are clear and the logical flow mirrors the original. Minor issues arise with occasional literal wording (e.g., “Imaginen que envías” instead of “Imagínese”) that slightly hampers readability for some readers, but overall the text remains comprehensible.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is fluent for the most part; however, a few phrases feel slightly formal or redundant, such as “en el prompt” or “en la conversación.” The use of “Imaginen” and “vosotros” could be more consistent with standard written Spanish. Overall, the text sounds natural, but a few grammatical adjustments would improve smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje. The translation keeps terminology consistent and understandable for a Spanish-speaking audience with a good grasp of AI concepts.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation successfully conveys the original intent and tone. Cultural references are minimal, so no significant adaptation is needed. The text remains appropriate for Spanish-speaking listeners, with a few minor idiomatic tweaks that could be made for greater localization.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present; no critical information was omitted. The translation maintains the nuance of ICL versus fine‑tuning and the explanation of memory functions. The content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully representing the French source while maintaining clarity and technical accuracy. Minor stylistic and grammatical refinements would raise the fluency even further, but the overall readability and comprehension are excellent for a Spanish‑speaking audience familiar with AI terminology."
