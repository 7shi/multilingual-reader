  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to follow. Sentences are clear, the logical flow mirrors the French source, and technical concepts are explained with plain language. Minor grammatical slips such as \"esas conocimientos\" or the slightly awkward phrasing of the first sentence about the IA being given a culture general do not seriously hinder comprehension. Overall, the text is readable for a general Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads quite naturally, using idiomatic expressions like \"revelar\", \"consultor\", \"memoria a corto plazo\" and \"en un solo uso\". Some minor lexical choices feel a bit literal, e.g. \"se le da a una nueva IA en la escuela para darle cultura general\" is a direct translation that could be smoother. The use of \"afianzamiento\" instead of \"ajuste fino\" in one place creates a small inconsistency. Despite these, the overall fluency is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pré‑entraînement\" → \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\" → \"ajuste fino\" (and later \"afianzamiento\"), \"in‑context learning\" → \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"ancrage\", \"memory\" → \"memoria\". The translation maintains consistency for most terms, though the shift from \"ajuste fino\" to \"afianzamiento\" may confuse readers who are not familiar with both equivalents. No major mistranslations or omissions.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The text is well adapted for Spanish readers; cultural references are minimal, but the use of \"consultor\" instead of the literal French \"consultant\" and the inclusion of a closing remark in Spanish demonstrate thoughtful adaptation. The tone remains conversational and approachable. Minor mismatches, such as keeping the French quotation marks in some places, do not significantly impact the adaptation.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French transcript is present. No major omissions or additions that would alter the meaning. The translation even expands slightly in the explanation of pre‑training, which can aid comprehension. Redundancy is minimal, and the content stays concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the original content with clear language and appropriate terminology. Minor grammatical errors and slight inconsistencies in term choice exist but do not detract significantly from readability or understanding. The translation achieves a balance between literal fidelity and natural expression, making it suitable for a general Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts."
