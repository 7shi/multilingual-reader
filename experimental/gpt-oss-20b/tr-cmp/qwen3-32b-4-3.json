    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation uses mostly clear sentence structures and follows the dialogue format. However, there are several lexical errors (e.g., \"moldena\" instead of \"moldea\") and some awkward phrasing (“desciframos la tecnología que moldena nuestro mundo”) that can hinder comprehension. Punctuation issues and extraneous parentheses at the end also reduce readability. Overall, the text is understandable but could be smoother.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most sentences flow reasonably well, the presence of literal translations and grammatical slip‑ups (missing hyphens, wrong word forms, odd word choices) make the text feel slightly mechanical. Some expressions feel out of place for native Spanish speakers, but the overall naturalness is acceptable.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", and \"anclaje\" are accurately rendered and consistently used. Minor issues include the lack of a hyphen in \"preentrenamiento\" and occasional informal wording, but overall terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent but contains some culturally inappropriate or incorrect wording (e.g., \"moldena\", extraneous parentheses, over‑literal phrasing). Adapting idioms and simplifying certain expressions would improve the adaptation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present; the dialogue is complete and no substantive information is omitted. Minor stylistic additions (e.g., explanatory parentheses) do not add redundancy and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is generally faithful and clear, correctly handling most technical terms and maintaining the dialogue structure. However, some lexical mistakes and awkward phrasing detract from readability and naturalness. With a few edits to correct word choice, punctuation, and cultural adaptation, the Spanish version could reach a higher level of polish. Overall, the translation demonstrates good competence but leaves room for improvement in fluency and contextual refinement, earning a solid score of 15/20."
