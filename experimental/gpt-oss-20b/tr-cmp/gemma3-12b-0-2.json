  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the logical flow and sentence structure of the original. The dialogue is easy to follow, and complex ideas (e.g., pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) are introduced in a way that a Spanish‑speaking audience can grasp. Minor grammatical hiccups and slightly literal wording reduce the score a touch.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall, the text sounds natural to a native speaker. Some phrases feel a bit literal (e.g., \"Imaginen que enviamos una IA completamente nueva\" instead of \"Imaginen enviar a una IA…\") and there are a few minor awkward word choices, but the text reads smoothly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently and correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, grounding (anclaje). The use of abbreviations (ICL) is clear and appropriate for a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue retains its conversational tone and adapts idiomatic expressions to Spanish (e.g., \"Imaginen\", \"para aprender los fundamentos…\"). Cultural references are minimal, but the translation remains faithful to the original's intent. Slightly more natural phrasing could improve the adaptation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All lines from the original are present, no significant omissions or additions. The translation remains concise and clear while conveying every idea.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation effectively conveys the content, tone, and technical detail of the original French script. While there is room for smoothing some literal phrasing, the overall quality is strong, with accurate terminology and a clear, natural style suitable for Spanish‑speaking audiences interested in AI concepts. The translation demonstrates a good balance between fidelity to the source and readability in the target language. Overall, it is a competent and largely polished rendering that will serve its intended purpose well. The average score reflects this solid performance with minor areas for refinement. Score: 17/20."
