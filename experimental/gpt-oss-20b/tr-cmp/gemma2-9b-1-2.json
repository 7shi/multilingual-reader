    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but it contains several fragments that remain in French (“C’est tout à fait ça. C’est pourquoi il…”, “telle est la réalité de l’ICL.”) and awkward phrasing (“Ustedes han comprendido todo”). These lapses interrupt the flow and can confuse readers, especially those who are not bilingual. However, the main ideas are conveyed and most sentences are clear enough for a native speaker to grasp the content.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mixes French and Spanish terms without proper adaptation, leading to unnatural expressions. Sentences like “C’est tout à fait ça. C’est pourquoi il” or “C’est donc une mémoire de uso único” break the rhythm expected in Spanish. The overall tone feels stilted and occasionally disjointed, reducing naturalness.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, and *aprendizaje en contexto* are correctly rendered. However, key terms like *ancrage* (“grounding”) and *grounding* itself are left untranslated, and there is inconsistent use of French phrases (*ICL*, *C’est*) within the Spanish context. This inconsistency weakens the clarity of technical concepts.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation stays close to the original content but fails to fully localize the language for a Spanish-speaking audience. The presence of untranslated French expressions and occasional literal translations of idioms reduce the cultural resonance and smoothness of the dialogue.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original information is present, but some sentences are incomplete or omitted. For instance, the explanatory sentence “C’est tout à fait ça. C’est pourquoi il peut devenir un expert….” is not fully translated, which leaves a gap in the logical flow. Redundancies are not overly present, but the missing translations create an incomplete picture.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is serviceable in terms of conveying the main ideas, yet it suffers from noticeable issues of language mixing, incomplete rendering of key terms, and a lack of full fluency. For a polished, professional Spanish version, the translator should remove residual French phrases, ensure all technical terms are consistently translated, and refine awkward phrasing to improve readability and naturalness. Overall, the quality is moderate but falls short of a high‑standard translation suitable for a broad Spanish-speaking audience.\n\nScore: 8.4/20 (average of the five criteria)."
