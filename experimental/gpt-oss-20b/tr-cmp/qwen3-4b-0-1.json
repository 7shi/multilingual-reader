    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely comprehensible to native speakers. The sentences follow a logical order, and most complex concepts are explained clearly. However, some long sentences and occasional missing articles (e.g., \"se puede tener una conversación larga y detallada\") slightly reduce clarity. Overall, readability is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly in most parts, but there are several unnatural expressions and awkward grammar: \"Usted ha entendido todo\" (should be \"has entendido\"), \"una antisèche\" (a French word that is not commonly used in Spanish), and some literal phrasing that feels stilted. Vocabulary choices are mostly appropriate, but the fluency suffers from these quirks.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled well: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto), anclaje, ventana de contexto. The terminology is consistent throughout the text, and the translator provides brief explanations where needed. The only minor issue is the retention of the French word \"antisèche\", which could be replaced with a Spanish equivalent. Overall, terminology is accurate and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and purpose of the original are preserved, and cultural references are adapted for a Spanish-speaking audience. However, some expressions (e.g., \"se puede tener una conversación larga y detallada\") feel a bit literal. The translator could have chosen more idiomatic Spanish in places to enhance cultural resonance. Nevertheless, the adaptation is largely effective.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation includes all major points from the original French script: pretraining, fine-tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory features, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No critical information is omitted, and redundancy is generally avoided. Minor omissions in nuance are negligible.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and conveys the essential ideas of the original French transcript. While readability and terminology are strong, the text could benefit from smoother phrasing and a more natural use of Spanish idioms. Addressing the few unnatural expressions would raise the overall quality noticeably. The translation is suitable for a general audience but could be polished further for a professional or native audience seeking fluency and cultural nuance. Overall, a solid effort with room for refinement in fluency and naturalness."
