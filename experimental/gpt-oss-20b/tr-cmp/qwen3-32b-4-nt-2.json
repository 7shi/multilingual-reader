  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow and the logical progression of ideas mirrors the original. However, some sentences contain awkward phrasing (e.g., *‘hacerla una especialista’* instead of *‘convertirla en una especialista’*) that slightly hampers smooth comprehension. Overall, readers can understand the content with minimal effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly fluent, but a few choices feel mechanical or unnatural for native speakers. Phrases like *‘en lugar de reentrenar la IA para hacerla una especialista’* and the capitalized *‘Memoria’* stand out as less idiomatic. The remainder reads smoothly, but these instances lower the overall fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *in‑context learning*, and *grounding* (anclaje) are accurate and consistently used. Minor inconsistencies appear only in the title and the capitalization of *Memoria*. The terminology overall supports the intended technical level.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The title has been altered from *Tech Éclair* to *Tecnología Claro*, which does not convey the original brand name and may confuse listeners. Additionally, the final sign‑off says *‘Iluminación Tecnológica’* instead of preserving the original phrase. Aside from this, cultural adaptation is adequate, but the title mismatch is a significant contextual error.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the full content of the French source, including all technical explanations and conversational nuances. No essential information is omitted, and redundancies are minimal. The slight shift in title does not impact the substantive message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is generally competent, maintaining clarity and most technical terms. However, inconsistencies in the title and some awkward phrasing lower the overall quality. With minor revisions—especially restoring the original podcast name and smoothing out a few unnatural expressions—the translation would reach an excellent level of fidelity and naturalness for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Overall, it is a solid but improvable effort, scoring 16/20 on average across the evaluated criteria. The average score is calculated by taking the mean of the five individual scores: (16+15+18+14+17)/5 = 16.0. The final score is 16/20.}"
