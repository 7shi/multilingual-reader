    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the conversational structure of the original. However, some sentences are awkwardly phrased (e.g., “Específicamente” as a reply, “I am seeing” literally translated). The logical flow is maintained, but the clarity suffers slightly from these odd phrasings and from occasional grammatical slips.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many expressions sound forced or non‑native. For example, “Vea usted” and “Tienes toda la razón” mix formal and informal tones inconsistently. Word choices such as “especialización” for *fine‑tuning* are acceptable but some verbs are used incorrectly (e.g., “específicamente” as a response). Overall, the translation feels patchy rather than smooth.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved: *pre-entrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *grounding* → *ancorado*. Minor inconsistencies exist (e.g., *specialization* translated as *especialización* but earlier *fine‑tuning* retained in English). The terminology is understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience, though a few could be refined for consistency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The show title is inconsistently translated: sometimes “Tech Iluminado” and sometimes “Tech Éclair”. Pronoun usage alternates between ‘tú’ and ‘usted’ without a clear rationale. Cultural adaptation is minimal; the translation does not improve or localize expressions beyond a literal rendition, which limits naturalness for Spanish listeners.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The bulk of the original content is present, and explanations are largely maintained. However, some lines are missing or garbled (e.g., the literal “I am seeing.”, some explanatory details are omitted or simplified). The overall message remains intact, but a few key nuances are lost or misrepresented.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the gist of the conversation and retains most of the technical terminology, but it suffers from inconsistent naming, awkward phrasing, and a few missing or garbled lines. For a polished, professional output, more careful copy‑editing and consistency checks would be needed. It would work for a quick draft, but a final version should address the noted issues to improve readability and fluency for native Spanish speakers. Overall, it is a decent attempt but falls short of a high‑quality translation. The average score of 13 out of 20 reflects these strengths and weaknesses. The translation is functional but requires revision for professional use. The missing elements, such as the consistent show name and smoother conversational flow, reduce its overall effectiveness in a Spanish‑speaking context. The translation is understandable but not entirely natural or polished. A more careful editing pass would raise the fluency and contextual adaptation scores significantly, improving the overall quality of the translation.  The current version is adequate for informal or internal use but would benefit from refinement before public distribution. The overall score of 13 indicates moderate quality that can be improved with targeted edits to address the highlighted problems, especially the consistency and naturalness of expressions, as well as ensuring all key details are accurately conveyed without loss or distortion. The result is a functional but uneven translation that needs tightening for optimal clarity and engagement in Spanish."
