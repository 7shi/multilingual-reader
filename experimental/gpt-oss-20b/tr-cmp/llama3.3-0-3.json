  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and explains the core concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning in a clear, step‑by‑step manner. Sentence structure is mostly straightforward, and the dialogue format preserves the conversational flow of the original. Minor syntactic quirks (e.g., “entre bastidores”) do not impede comprehension. Overall, readers can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a Spanish‑speaking audience, with appropriate colloquial expressions such as “Hola y bienvenidos” and idiomatic phrases like “¡Una analogía perfecta!”. Some phrases feel slightly formal or mechanical (“el sistema busca rápidamente … entre bastidores”), but they do not detract from fluency. The occasional use of the English word “prompt” is understandable but could be replaced with a Spanish equivalent for full smoothness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, ventana de contexto, memoria a corto plazo, etc. The translation preserves key English acronyms (ICL) while providing their Spanish meanings. No significant terminology errors or inconsistencies appear, and the chosen words are appropriate for a general audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator kept the cultural nuance of the original French podcast while adapting expressions for Spanish listeners. Phrases like “consolidad la identidad” and “consultor brillante” resonate with the target audience. Some minor cultural references (e.g., “entre bastidores”) could be more idiomatic, but overall the intent and tone are preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present: the stages of learning, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, the role of memory features, and the concluding remarks. No critical information is omitted, and the translation stays concise without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is a high‑quality rendition that accurately conveys the original content, maintains the dialogue style, and uses appropriate terminology. While a few phrases could be polished for even greater naturalness, the translation is clear, comprehensive, and suitable for a general Spanish‑speaking audience."
