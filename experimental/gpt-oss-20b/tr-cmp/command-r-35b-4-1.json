  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version uses mostly clear sentence structures, but some phrases are overly literal or wordy (e.g., \"se envía una nueva o completamente nueva IA a la escuela\"), which can confuse readers. Overall, the text remains comprehensible, but the flow could be smoother.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several awkward phrasings and non‑native idioms such as \"en la caja de texto\" for prompt, and a few grammatical slips. The vocabulary is generally appropriate, yet the overall feel is more literal than natural for native Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly translated: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, memoria. Some consistency issues (e.g., switching between \"ventana contextual\" and \"ventana de contexto\") appear, but the terminology remains largely accurate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts some cultural references (e.g., changing the podcast name to \"Tecnología Relámpago\") but also introduces inconsistencies like \"Tech Flash\" at the end. Certain expressions feel unnatural or are not fully adapted to Spanish cultural norms, reducing contextual cohesion.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The main points of the original dialogue are preserved. Minor omissions or paraphrasing may slightly alter emphasis, but no critical content is missing. The translation keeps the structure and content largely intact.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is understandable and captures the essential ideas, but its naturalness suffers from literal phrasing and occasional inconsistencies. Refining sentence flow and standardizing terminology would raise the overall quality significantly. It would benefit from a final polish to align it more closely with native Spanish expectations for a podcast transcript about AI concepts. Overall, it’s a solid foundation but needs further refinement for fluency and cultural adaptation. The translation shows clear effort but leaves room for improvement in style and precision. The average score across the criteria is 14 out of 20, reflecting a competent but not exemplary translation. A more attentive edit would elevate it to an 18‑20 range, ensuring both readability and naturalness for Spanish‑speaking audiences."
