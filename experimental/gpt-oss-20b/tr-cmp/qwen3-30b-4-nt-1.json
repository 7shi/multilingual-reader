  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly coherent, but the presence of repeated blocks and misattributed speaker labels (e.g., \"Camille: Soy Luc.\") interrupts the flow and makes it harder for readers to follow the dialogue. These artifacts reduce readability. The core ideas remain understandable, but the redundancy and occasional confusion lower the score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences read smoothly and use appropriate Spanish syntax. However, some expressions feel awkward (e.g., \"Ha comprendido todo.\"), and the accidental insertion of the English word \"inefficient\" disrupts fluency. Overall, the translation is fluent but not perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved (preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, anclaje). Minor issues include the misspelling of \"ineficiente\" as the English word \"inefficient\" and the generic use of \"aprendizaje en contexto\" for ICL, which is acceptable. Consistency is good, but the small typo lowers the score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references (e.g., \"¡Gracias por habernos escuchado!\") and maintains the informal podcast tone. Yet, the duplicated segments and mislabeling of speakers break the contextual flow, reducing the effectiveness of the adaptation. Therefore, the score is modest.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French are present in the Spanish version; no essential content is omitted. The repetition merely adds redundancy rather than missing information, so the translation is considered complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the overall meaning of the French source and uses correct terminology for the most part. However, duplicated passages and misattributed speaker labels detract from readability and fluency. The translation would benefit from a thorough proofread to eliminate repetition and correct the accidental use of English words. With those corrections, the translation could reach a high level of quality, but as it stands, it falls short of perfect execution. Overall, the translation is adequate but requires cleanup to meet professional standards."
