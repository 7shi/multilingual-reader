    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "Readability: 17/20 – The dialogue is easy to follow, with logical sentence structure and clear explanations, but some punctuation and phrasing could be smoother.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Fluency: 15/20 – Generally natural, yet a few awkward verb choices (e.g., “Entienden” instead of “Entiendes”) and the retention of the French word “D’accord” reduce fluidity.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Terminology: 14/20 – Core terms are correctly translated, but “fine‑tuning” and “ancrage” remain untranslated, creating slight inconsistency.",

    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Contextual adaptation: 16/20 – Cultural adaptation is good overall; the only slip is the untranslated French phrase “D’accord”.",

    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Information completeness: 18/20 – The translation includes all major points of the original, with no substantial omissions; a few minor details are redundant or slightly misphrased.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful and understandable, though it contains a few lingering French terms, minor grammatical quirks, and some terminology left in English. The overall sense of the dialogue and technical explanations is preserved, and the text remains clear for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Some polishing would bring the quality closer to native fluency, but the translation meets most quality standards for readability, fluency, terminology, contextual adaptation, and information completeness. The overall score is 16/20, reflecting strong performance with room for minor refinements in consistency and naturalness of language use. "
