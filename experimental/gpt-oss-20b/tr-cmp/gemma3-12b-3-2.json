  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is overall easy to read and the dialogue flows logically. The concepts are explained in a straightforward manner, and the sentence structures are generally clear. However, a few phrasing choices (e.g., “Lo has entendido” and “bachoter”) could be slightly confusing for native speakers. Overall, the text is quite readable.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation sounds natural and follows Spanish syntax. Minor issues include the use of “bachoter” (an uncommon term) and a few repeated phrasing (“Lo has entendido”). Vocabulary choices are largely appropriate and contemporary. These small quirks prevent a perfect fluency score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly correctly rendered: *pre-entrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto*. The choice of *fundamentación* for *ancrage* is acceptable but could have been *anclaje* for precision. Overall consistency is good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapted the podcast name to *Tecno Revelada*, which localizes the brand. However, the final line still refers to *Tech Éclair*, creating a minor inconsistency. Cultural references are otherwise handled well, but this inconsistency slightly weakens contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are preserved. No essential information is omitted, and the translation does not add extraneous content. Minor details such as the ICL abbreviation are maintained. Thus, the translation is complete and concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation effectively conveys the original dialogue and technical concepts, making it understandable for native speakers. While there are minor fluency hiccups and a slight inconsistency in brand naming, the work demonstrates solid handling of terminology and contextual adaptation. The translation is suitable for a general audience interested in AI technology discussions, though a final polish could address the few awkward phrasing choices and name consistency for a flawless result. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation with room for minor refinement. The final overall score reflects an average of the individual criteria, indicating strong overall quality but acknowledging small areas for improvement. 17/20."
