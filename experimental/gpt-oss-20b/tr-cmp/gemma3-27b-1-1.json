    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly clear and logical. The dialogue structure is preserved and most complex ideas are explained in a way that a Spanish‑speaking listener could follow easily. Some sentences feel slightly wordy (e.g., “El modelo en sí no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de tus conversaciones.”) and a few small gaps in the flow appear due to untranslated fragments. Overall, readers can understand the content without much difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most of the script, with appropriate colloquial phrasing for a podcast format. However, there are a few non‑native touches: the residual French phrase “C'est une excellente remarque,” appears in the middle of Spanish dialogue, and some expressions (“¿Entonces es un truco?”) could be slightly more polished. These issues make the text a little less smooth but do not severely hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto* and *In‑Context Learning* are correctly rendered and consistently used. The term *ancrage* was rendered as *anclaje*, which is appropriate. Minor inconsistency: “ICL” remains in English but this is acceptable for a specialized audience. Overall terminology is handled well.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation captures the informal, conversational tone of the original French script and respects the cultural context of Spanish‑speaking listeners. Phrases such as “el mundo en general” and “entender los conceptos” fit well. The only issue is the leftover French fragment, which slightly disrupts the cultural coherence.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the bulk of the information, including all key explanations about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL, memory, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. However, the stray French sentence “C'est une excellente remarque,” and the absence of a Spanish equivalent for the final line “C'est une excellente remarque,” represent minor omissions that could confuse readers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is strong overall, delivering the content with clarity and a natural, conversational tone suitable for a podcast audience. Minor issues such as the residual French phrase and some slightly awkward sentences slightly lower the fluency and completeness, but they do not compromise understanding. With a few edits to remove untranslated fragments and polish a few expressions, the translation would be nearly perfect."
