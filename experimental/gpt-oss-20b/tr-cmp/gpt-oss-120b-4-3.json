    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version keeps the same clear, conversational structure as the French original and explains technical concepts in a straightforward manner. Minor issues appear in word choice consistency (e.g., switching between *tu* and *usted*) and occasional wordiness (“su propio modelo” versus “el modelo”), but overall the text is easy to follow and well‑structured.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural to native Spanish speakers, but a few phrases feel slightly awkward or literal, such as “El aprendizaje en contexto equivale a un estudio intensivo de última hora” and “se ha vaciado su espacio de trabajo temporal”. The occasional mix of formal/informal pronouns and the use of the English word *prompt* in italics reduce smoothness. Nevertheless, grammar is correct and vocabulary is appropriate.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL* and *grounding* → *anclaje*. The translation preserves the original acronyms and explains concepts when needed, ensuring readability for a non‑expert audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and tone, adapting idioms and cultural references for Spanish listeners (e.g., using “consultor brillante” instead of a literal “consultor inteligente”). Small inconsistencies in formality (tu/usted) slightly weaken the adaptation, but the overall cultural relevance remains strong.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All parts of the original script are present, including the final sign‑off. No critical information is omitted, and redundancies are not introduced. The translation even adds a subtle clarification in the last line (“en el próximo episodio”) which preserves the original meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and faithful to the source. It balances clarity, technical accuracy, and naturalness quite well. Minor stylistic polish would improve flow, but the text already delivers the intended message clearly to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Overall, it represents a strong, near‑perfect adaptation of the French original into Spanish, suitable for a professional podcast audience. The overall score reflects an excellent performance with room for small refinements in fluency and formality consistency. The translation demonstrates good control over terminology and contextual nuances, ensuring the content is both technically accurate and culturally resonant. Great job overall, just a touch of smoothing could take it from very good to excellent."
