    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version keeps the dialogue format and the flow of ideas, allowing listeners/readers to follow the discussion easily. Minor punctuation issues (e.g., missing accents in “¿Porque”) and a couple of slightly awkward phrases (“Y ese aprendizaje…”) reduce clarity a little, but overall the text is comprehensible.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly natural. Some expressions are slightly clunky (e.g., “Y ese aprendizaje” instead of “Y este aprendizaje”, “¿Entonces es una artimaña?”). Grammar is mostly correct, but the lack of an accent in “¿Porque” and occasional literal word‑for‑word rendering of idioms lower the naturalness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are translated appropriately: pre-entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, grounding, etc. The usage is consistent throughout. Explanations for key concepts are present, so the target audience can understand.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The tone remains conversational, matching a podcast script. Cultural adaptation is adequate; Spanish idioms are used when necessary. The translation preserves the original intent and engages a Spanish‑speaking audience without awkward cultural references.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All main points from the original are present, including the explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL, and the memory feature. No substantial content is omitted, and redundancies are minimal. The only minor loss is a slightly less explicit mention of the “grounding” concept, which is still covered.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and largely faithful to the source text. It captures the conversational tone, explains technical ideas clearly, and keeps the information complete. Minor fluency and punctuation issues prevent a perfect score, but the overall quality is high and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience familiar with AI concepts. A few small edits (e.g., adding accents, smoothing a few expressions) would bring it to near‑perfect quality. Overall, a strong translation that effectively communicates the original content in Spanish. 16/20 points overall."
