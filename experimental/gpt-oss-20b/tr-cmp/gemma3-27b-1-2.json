    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and easy to follow. The dialogue flows naturally and most technical concepts are explained in a way that a lay reader can grasp. Minor readability hiccups stem from a few awkward sentences and a small missing line that interrupts the logical flow. Overall, the text is readable for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural and smooth. The speaker turns and idiomatic expressions are mostly preserved. However, the presence of untranslated French fragments such as \"C'est une excellente remarque,\" as well as a few literal phrasings (e.g., \"aprendizaje en contexto\" instead of the more common \"aprendizaje por contexto\") slightly disrupt fluency. Grammatical errors like \"una conocimiento\" further reduce smoothness. Hence, the fluency is high but not perfect.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: \"pre-entrenamiento,\" \"ajuste fino,\" \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL), and \"IA\" are all accurate and appropriate. Consistency is good, though sometimes \"IA\" is switched to \"modelo\" without a clear pattern. The occasional misspelling of a grammatical article (\"una conocimiento\") does not significantly affect terminology clarity. Overall, terminology is appropriate and largely consistent.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator has considered cultural background and used expressions familiar to Spanish speakers. The narrative tone and the conversational style fit a podcast format. Some expressions that might feel more idiomatic in Spanish were kept literal (e.g., \"In-Context Learning\" translated directly). The untranslated French phrase indicates a lapse in contextual adaptation. Nonetheless, the intent and purpose of the original text are largely preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The majority of information from the source is present. However, the phrase \"C'est une excellente remarque,\" remains untranslated, creating a gap. Additionally, a small portion of the dialogue feels incomplete because of that missing line, which slightly affects the comprehensiveness. No major content was omitted otherwise, and redundancy is minimal.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "This is a high‑quality translation that effectively conveys the original French content to a Spanish audience. It demonstrates strong readability, terminology usage, and contextual adaptation. Minor issues—most notably the untranslated French fragment and a few grammatical slips—prevent it from achieving a perfect score. With a few edits to correct those errors, the translation would be polished and fully coherent. Overall, it stands as a solid translation suitable for a podcast audience, with a few small refinements needed to reach excellence."
