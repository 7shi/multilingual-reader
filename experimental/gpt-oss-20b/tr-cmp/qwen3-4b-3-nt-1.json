    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish dialogue is generally clear and the ideas follow the structure of the original. However, several sentences use literal or awkward phrasing (e.g., “bienvenido en” instead of “bienvenido a”), which can momentarily distract readers. Overall, the target audience can understand the content, but a few constructions hinder smooth flow.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the text reads naturally, but there are noticeable unnatural expressions and grammatical slips: “bienvenido en” is incorrect, “se le ha proporcionado solo un precalentamiento” is a literal but inappropriate translation of *antisèche*, and “la IA se recuerda” would sound odd. These issues lower the sense of native‑speaker fluency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly rendered (*preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *anclaje*). Minor inconsistencies appear (e.g., *memoria a corto plazo* vs *memoria de corto plazo*), but overall terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the conversational tone suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but some cultural adjustments are missed: the use of “en” instead of “a” in the welcome line, and the word “precálido” for *antisèche* feels off culturally. The adaptation is acceptable but could be refined.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All main points from the original are present; no significant omissions or additions. Redundancies are minimal, and the translation retains the essential content. A few phrases (e.g., the explanation of “memorization” as a feature) are slightly re‑phrased but still convey the same idea.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the core meaning and conversational style of the French original, but it contains several linguistic inaccuracies and unnatural expressions that affect readability and fluency. Technical terminology is largely correct and consistent. With a few adjustments—especially in phrasing, grammar, and idiomatic choices—the translation would reach a higher quality level suitable for native readers."
