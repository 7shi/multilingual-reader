  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the structure of the original. Sentences are clear enough for a general audience to grasp the concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning. However, a few phrases are literal and somewhat clunky (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido para…”) and a few long sentences could be broken up for better flow. Overall readability is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural expressions (e.g., using \"para\" instead of \"a\" in the greeting, repeated phrases like \"Aprendizaje en contexto\"), and some punctuation choices are awkward. Word choice is mostly appropriate, but the text would sound more natural with minor adjustments. Fluency is competent but could be improved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"transfer learning\" and \"ventana de contexto\" are correctly rendered. The translation consistently uses the same Spanish equivalents, which aids comprehension. The term \"grounding\" is rendered as \"anclaje\", which is acceptable in this context. The terminology is accurate and well applied.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and style, and adapts cultural references appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Some expressions could be more idiomatic (e.g., \"consultor brillante\" vs. simply \"consultor\"), but overall the adaptation is effective and culturally appropriate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French text is preserved; nothing significant is omitted. The Spanish version includes all explanations, analogies, and examples. Minor redundancies exist but they do not detract from clarity. The translation is complete and concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is generally faithful to the original French script and conveys the intended concepts with good readability and technical accuracy. Some linguistic nuances and naturalness could be refined, but the overall quality is solid and suitable for a general audience familiar with AI terminology. The translator has successfully maintained the conversational tone and informational depth of the original episode while providing clear, comprehensible Spanish text. With a few stylistic adjustments, the translation would be close to native‑level quality. The average score across criteria is 16.4/20, indicating a strong but slightly improvable job. The translator demonstrates solid technical knowledge and a good grasp of contextual adaptation, though attention to natural phrasing and idiomatic usage would further elevate the final product. The translation is reliable and could serve as a basis for public consumption with minimal editing needed. Overall, a commendable effort with room for fine‑tuning in fluency and stylistic polish. The overall score is 16.5 out of 20."
