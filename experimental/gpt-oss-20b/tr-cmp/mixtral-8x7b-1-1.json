  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several grammatical errors that impede comprehension, notably the misuse of gender for *IA* (“El IA” instead of *la IA*). Sentence structure is mostly preserved, but these errors and occasional missing accents make the text harder to read for a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation often reads awkwardly. Phrases such as ‘El aprendizaje en contexto es bachotear!’ feel clunky, and the gender mistake with *IA* disrupts natural flow. Vocabulary choices are generally correct but the overall smoothness is lacking.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: *pre-entrenamiento*, *finetuning* (translated as *especialización*), *in-context learning* (aprender en contexto). Minor inconsistencies appear with the term *afinamiento* for *fine‑tuning*, but overall terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The brand name *Tech Éclair* was partially changed to *Tech Flash* at the beginning, which may confuse listeners. Aside from that, cultural references such as *cajas negras* are fine, but the inconsistency in brand naming and some literal translations reduce contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is preserved. No major sections are omitted, though the brand name inconsistency and some missing accents could affect clarity. The translation retains the essential information and examples.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the main ideas of the original French script, but it suffers from significant grammatical errors (particularly the gender mistake with *IA*), awkward phrasing, and an inconsistent brand name. While technical terminology is largely correct, readability and fluency need considerable improvement to match the quality expected of a polished, professional podcast script in Spanish. The translation could benefit from a thorough copy‑editing pass to correct gender usage, improve natural flow, and ensure consistent branding throughout the episode. Overall, the script is understandable but would be considered sub‑par for a native Spanish audience until these issues are addressed. 13/20 points overall reflect these strengths and weaknesses, with the main shortfall being fluency and accurate gender usage, and a minor issue with contextual adaptation due to the brand name change. The content is complete, but readability and naturalness require refinement to achieve a professional standard for the target audience. 13.4/20."
