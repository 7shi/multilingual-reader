  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically structured, and complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and transfer learning are explained in a way that most Spanish speakers would understand. Minor syntactic oddities (e.g., “Imaginen que envían una IA recién creada…”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation flows naturally for native Spanish speakers, using a conversational register appropriate for a podcast. Some phrases feel slightly informal or repetitive (e.g., “El ajuste fino... ¿no es donde se aplica el aprendizaje por transferencia?”), but overall the text reads smoothly with minimal grammatical awkwardness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL). The term grounding becomes anclaje, which is a correct adaptation. Explanations are concise and aligned with the target audience’s likely knowledge level.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator keeps the original tone (informal, conversational) while using Spanish idioms that are natural for a podcast audience. Cultural references are minimal, and the content remains faithful to the French source without adding unnecessary localization.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, short‑term memory, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No significant omissions or misleading alterations appear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation demonstrates a high level of fidelity and readability, with only minor fluency issues. It successfully conveys the technical concepts and the conversational tone of the original French podcast script, making it suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners interested in AI and technology. Minor refinements could improve the naturalness of a few colloquial expressions, but overall the translation is of very good quality and would serve its intended purpose well. The average score is 18/20, reflecting a strong translation with room for slight polish in flow and stylistic consistency. The detailed reasoning behind each criterion is provided above to justify the scores and highlight the strengths and minor weaknesses of the text. Overall, the translator has produced a clear, accurate, and contextually appropriate Spanish version of the French script."
