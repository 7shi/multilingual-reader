  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely easy to follow, and the conversational tone is preserved. Minor issues such as \"El ajuste fine\" (missing accent), \"¿Porque ya\" (missing accent), and \"es una truco\" (incorrect gender agreement) slightly impede clarity, but the overall structure is logical and the concepts are understandable to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly for the most part, but some awkward constructions appear: \"proporcionarle los documentos de información exactos\", \"preguntas y respuestas\" (unidiomatic), and the repetition of \"Ella olvida todo.\" These issues reduce naturalness. The vocabulary is contemporary and appropriate, but a few grammatical slips lower the fluency score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are translated correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"ancraje\". The abbreviation ICL is retained and explained. Minor concern: \"ancraje\" may be less common than \"anclaje\", but it is still understandable. Overall, terminology handling is consistent and clear.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and humor, and it adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., using \"Tech Éclair\" unchanged). Some expressions could be further localized (e.g., \"desvelar\" could be \"revelar\"), yet the current version effectively conveys the same meaning for Spanish listeners.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original is present. There are no significant omissions, and the content stays concise. Minor repetitions (e.g., the double statement about forgetting) do not detract from completeness. The translation preserves the nuance of temporary vs. permanent knowledge.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and largely faithful to the original French script. It maintains the conversational flow and covers all technical concepts accurately. The main drawbacks are a handful of grammatical mistakes and slightly awkward phrasing that affect readability and fluency. With a few editorial fixes, it would be a strong, listener‑friendly translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience. Overall, the quality is high and justifies an average score of 16/20, reflecting minor polish needed but strong overall fidelity and clarity. The translation successfully communicates the complex ideas about AI training and context learning in a natural, accessible manner for Spanish speakers. Good job, but review the highlighted errors to refine the final version."
