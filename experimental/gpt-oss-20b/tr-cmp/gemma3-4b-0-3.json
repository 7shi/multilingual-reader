  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is mostly understandable, but several sentences contain awkward word choices and missing accents (e.g., \"¿Porque\" instead of \"¿Por qué\"). Repeated or duplicated lines (e.g., the explanation of ICL appears twice) interrupt the flow. Overall, a reader can follow the dialogue, but the coherence suffers from these lapses.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads with a number of unnatural constructions: \"las informaciones de las que necesita\", \"estructura de frase\" instead of \"estructura de la frase\", and the accidental insertion of a French sentence \"Telle est la réalité du ICL\". Punctuation and accent errors also affect smoothness. While the translation is not incomprehensible, it lacks the natural rhythm expected from a native speaker.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved (pre-entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, anclaje, Memoria). However, there is some inconsistency in singular/plural usage (informaciones vs. información) and the word \"prompt\" is left untranslated. Overall, terminology is appropriate but could be more consistent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Cultural adaptation is generally adequate – idioms like \"levantar el velo\" and analogies (consultant, learning to ride a bike) translate well. Yet the translation fails to adapt a key explanatory sentence (“Vous avez tout compris…”) and repeats other parts unnecessarily. Thus, the intent is conveyed but with some gaps.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several lines from the original are omitted (the sentence about \"Vous avez tout compris…\") and some content is duplicated. While the bulk of the dialogue is present, missing passages and redundant sections reduce completeness. No major concepts are omitted, but precision is affected.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the overall meaning and most technical details, but it is marred by grammatical errors, unnatural phrasing, duplicated content, and a noticeable omission of an explanatory sentence. The result is intelligible but not polished; a native‑speaking reviewer would find several awkward spots and would likely request revisions for clarity and consistency. Improvements should focus on correcting accent errors, refining phrasing for natural flow, removing repetitions, and ensuring all original content is present and accurately translated. The translation shows good intent but requires refinement to meet professional standards for a podcast transcript intended for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The overall score reflects a solid but improvable effort: 14 out of 20 points."
