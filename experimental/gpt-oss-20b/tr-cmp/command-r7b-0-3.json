  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally comprehensible and follows a logical flow that mirrors the original. However, minor grammatical errors (e.g. “só mismo” instead of “sí mismo”, “informaciones” instead of “información”) and awkward word choices (e.g. “ventana de discusión” instead of “ventana de chat” or “ventana de conversación”) slightly reduce clarity. Overall, readers can understand the content, but these small issues affect readability.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly fluent, but several phrases feel literal or stilted. For example, “Aprendizaje en Contexto Interno” is not a standard expression in Spanish; it would be more natural to say “Aprendizaje en contexto” or simply “ICL”. The sentence “El aprendizaje en contexto es memorización” is fine, but some others (“se le ha proporcionado una información para repasar justo antes de empezar a hablar”) sound clumsy. Overall fluency is acceptable but could be improved.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino” (fine‑tuning), “aprendizaje por transferencia” and “ventana de contexto” are correctly rendered. The occasional misuse of plural (“informaciones”) and the odd phrase “Aprendizaje en Contexto Interno” slightly compromise consistency, but terminology remains largely accurate and appropriate for a technical audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, but some cultural adaptations could be refined. For instance, the phrase “ventana de discusión” is understandable but less common than “ventana de chat” or “ventana de conversación”. The use of idioms is minimal, which keeps the translation safe but also somewhat literal. The overall adaptation is good, with minor room for improvement in natural Spanish expressions.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present in the Spanish version, and no critical information is omitted. The explanation of ICL, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and memory features is intact. Some minor details (e.g., the exact wording of “grounding” or “anchor” concept) are slightly paraphrased but still convey the same idea. The text remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid overall, accurately conveying the technical concepts and narrative structure. It shows a good grasp of terminology and context, with only a few grammatical slips and some phrases that could be more idiomatic. These minor issues slightly affect readability and fluency but do not undermine the overall comprehension of the content. With minor revisions, the translation would read like a natural, professional Spanish podcast script suitable for the target audience. The overall quality earns a balanced score of 80 out of 100, indicating a competent but improvable translation effort. The key areas for improvement are refining grammatical accuracy, smoothing idiomatic expressions, and correcting the occasional pluralization and word choice errors to enhance naturalness and precision in the target language. Overall, it serves its purpose well and provides clear, accurate information about AI training and context learning."
