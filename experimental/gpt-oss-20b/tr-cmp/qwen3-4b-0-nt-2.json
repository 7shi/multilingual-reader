    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is mostly understandable, but several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing (e.g., “Lo entendiste todo” instead of “Lo has entendido todo”, “Entonces es una astucia?”) interrupt the flow. Despite these issues, the speaker’s intent and the logical structure of the dialogue remain clear.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several non‑native constructions and errors that disrupt naturalness – such as the preposition “en” instead of “al” after *bienvenido*, the misuse of “Lo entendiste todo”, and the abrupt insertion of “Entonces” in a question. These mistakes make the text feel somewhat stilted, though the overall meaning is retained. Vocabulary choices are mostly correct but could be smoother (e.g., *ajuste fino* instead of *afinamiento*).",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and appropriately translated: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *anclaje*. The acronym ICL is kept consistent. Minor inconsistencies exist (e.g., *afinamiento* vs. the more common *ajuste fino*), but overall terminology handling is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly preserves the informal, conversational tone of the original French podcast. However, some cultural and idiomatic adjustments are missing or incorrect: the phrase “Hola y bienvenido en…” should be “Hola y bienvenido al…”, the repeated use of *consultor* is fine, but the sentence “Entonces es una astucia?” is awkward in Spanish. Adaptation of culturally specific references (like the idea of a “consultor brillante”) is generally acceptable but could be more natural. Overall, the cultural context is respected but not fully optimized.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish translation. No significant content is omitted, and the explanation of concepts such as pretraining, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and memory features is preserved. Minor omissions include the preposition error (“en” vs. “al”) and a slight lack of a clarifying phrase about *prompt* that could aid comprehension, but these do not reduce the overall completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main ideas and maintains the conversational style, but it is marred by several grammatical inaccuracies and awkward phrasing that reduce readability and fluency. Technical terminology is handled well, and the information is largely complete. With a few edits—correcting prepositions, revising awkward sentences, and polishing vocabulary—the text could reach a high level of naturalness and clarity for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Overall, it is a good effort that would benefit from a final proofreading round to achieve polish and native‑level fluidity. 16/20."
