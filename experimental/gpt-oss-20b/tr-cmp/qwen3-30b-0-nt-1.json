    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. The sentence structure mimics the original, and complex concepts such as pre‑training and fine‑tuning are explained in a straightforward way. Some sentences are slightly awkward (e.g., *‘Imagina que enviamos una nueva IA a la escuela para darle una cultura general’*), but overall the dialogue remains comprehensible for a native Spanish reader.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly sounds natural; however, there are several minor grammatical slips and unnatural phrases (e.g., *‘Se puede decir eso’*, *‘las información’*, missing accents). Punctuation is occasionally inconsistent (hyphenation of *pre‑entrenamiento*). These issues slightly disrupt the smoothness, lowering fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL (aprendizaje en contexto)*. The usage is consistent, and explanations are present where needed. A small point: *ICL* could be clarified as *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)*, but overall terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and humor, and the cultural context is largely respected. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., using *‘consultor brillante’* instead of *‘consultant brillant’*) fit Spanish audiences. The adaptation is effective, but a few phrasing choices could be more idiomatic.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are present: the stages of training, transfer learning, context‑learning, grounding, memory features, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. No critical information is omitted, and redundancy is avoided. Small nuances (like the hyphenation of *pre‑entrenamiento*) are irrelevant to meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately, but it could benefit from a polish in grammar and phrasing to achieve a truly native‑level flow. Minor edits would elevate the text to high‑quality standard."
