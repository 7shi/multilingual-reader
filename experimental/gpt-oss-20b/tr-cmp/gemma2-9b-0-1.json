    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish transcript is easy to read for a native audience. Sentence structures are mostly straightforward, and the logical flow mirrors the original French dialogue. However, a few long sentences could be split for greater clarity. Overall, the text remains comprehensible and well‑structured.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are minor grammatical and lexical slips – e.g., \"Se olvida todo\" instead of \"se olvida de todo\", the use of \"afianzamiento\" for \"afinage\" is slightly unconventional, and \"fundamentación\" for \"ancrage\" feels a bit formal. These issues do not impede understanding but slightly reduce the flow. The overall register is appropriate for a podcast audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely translated correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"Memoria\". The choice of \"afianzamiento\" instead of the more common \"afinamiento\" is consistent, but could be confusing for some readers. \"Anclaje\" might have been preferred over \"fundamentación\". Nonetheless, terminology is accurate and consistent throughout.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the humor and casual tone of the original French script, uses Spanish idiomatic expressions where appropriate, and adapts cultural references (e.g., “Hola y bienvenidos”). The format stays true to a podcast dialogue. No major cultural missteps are present, and the adaptation is suitable for Spanish‑speaking audiences.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All original content is present in the translation. No sections are omitted, and the narrative flow remains intact. The translation covers every exchange, including the explanation of technical concepts, contextual adaptation, and the concluding remarks. No redundant information is added, keeping the transcript concise yet comprehensive.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, accurately conveying the original French content while maintaining a natural and engaging tone. Minor grammatical quirks and slight lexical choices detract slightly from perfect fluency, but the overall readability, terminology handling, and contextual adaptation are excellent. The translation delivers the full message without omissions, making it suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience seeking to understand the nuances of AI training and context‑based learning discussed in the podcast. A small polish on terminology consistency would raise the score to near‑perfect level, but the current version is already very good for broadcast use or publication in a Spanish‑language tech podcast series."
