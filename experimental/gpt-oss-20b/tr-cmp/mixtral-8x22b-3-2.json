    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely comprehensible and follows a logical structure that mirrors the original French dialogue. Sentences are short and the conversational tone is preserved. Minor issues arise with awkward phrasing in a few places (e.g., “partes de un contexto vacío”), but overall a native Spanish speaker would easily understand the content.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most of the translation reads smoothly, there are several spots where the wording feels clunky or out of place. For example, “aprendizaje supervisado” is used to translate “fine‑tuning”, which is technically incorrect, and “afino” is not a Spanish word. The phrase “una antisèche” is a French loan that should be replaced by a more natural Spanish equivalent. These issues slightly reduce the natural flow of the text.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto” are appropriate. However, the translation of “fine‑tuning” as “aprendizaje supervisado” and the use of “afino” are inaccurate, and the acronym “ICL” was mistakenly rendered as “ACL”. Consistency could be improved in these areas.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal, explanatory style of the original podcast. Cultural references are generally adapted well, though the use of a French word (“antisèche”) in Spanish might surprise listeners. Overall, the adaptation effectively conveys the intent and tone to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original text are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the final reflection. No substantive content is omitted, and redundancy is minimal. The text could be slightly more concise by removing a few repetitive clarifications, but it remains clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is good overall and captures the essence and conversational tone of the original French podcast. It does, however, contain a few technical inaccuracies and some awkward wording that could be refined to improve clarity and fluency for native Spanish speakers. With minor revisions, it would be a strong, faithful translation."
