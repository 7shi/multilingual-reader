  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is mostly understandable, but the presence of stray “}” characters, incomplete sentences, and awkward phrasing makes the text difficult to follow in places. 12/20 reflects that the overall readability is good but impaired by these formatting glitches.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several sentences use clunky or non‑idiomatic expressions (e.g., \"Piensen en que enviamos…\", \"en vez de enviarlo seguir…\").  The overall flow feels mechanical at times, reducing naturalness. 10/20 is appropriate.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje contextual\", and \"anclaje\" are correctly used and consistent.  Minor inconsistencies exist, but the terminology is generally appropriate. 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Cultural references and idiomatic equivalents are mostly preserved; however, some phrases could be smoother for a Spanish audience.  The adaptation is acceptable but not outstanding. 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many formatting errors (extra brackets, truncated sentences) that omit or duplicate parts of the original dialogue.  Important content is lost or repeated, so the information is incomplete. 10/20.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version conveys the core ideas and keeps most technical terminology intact, yet it is marred by numerous formatting glitches, incomplete sections, and several unnatural phrasings.  These issues hinder a smooth reading experience and reduce the professionalism of the text.  A thorough revision that removes the stray characters, completes missing parts, and refines the language would significantly improve the translation quality."
