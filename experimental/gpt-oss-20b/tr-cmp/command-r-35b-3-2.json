    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version maintains the overall structure of the dialogue and presents complex ideas in a fairly accessible way. Simple explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are conveyed clearly, and the sentences flow logically. However, occasional wordy constructions (e.g., “La totalidad de la conversación que han mantenido hasta ahora…”) slightly hinder readability. Overall, the target audience can understand the content with ease.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for native Spanish speakers. Most expressions are natural, but a few phrases feel slightly awkward, such as \"El aprendizaje contextual entra en acción\" and the parenthetical explanation of \"ajuste fino (afinamiento detallado)\". The overall register is appropriate, though a few sentences could be tightened for better flow.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms are largely correct: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding (anclaje). However, consistency issues arise: the text alternates between \"aprendizaje contextual\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\", and the dual use of \"ajuste fino (afinamiento detallado)\" may confuse readers. Additionally, the word \"prompt\" is left untranslated, which is acceptable but could be replaced with \"entrada\" for clarity.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation generally respects the original intent and tone. Cultural references are minimal, so direct translation suffices. The main issue is the inconsistent use of the show name: early parts refer to \"Flash Tech\", while the closing uses \"Tech Éclair\". This inconsistency slightly undermines the contextual adaptation. Otherwise, the dialogue feels natural for a Spanish audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the memory feature. No substantial content is omitted. Minor redundancies exist but do not detract from clarity. The only omission is the inconsistent show name, which is a stylistic rather than informational gap.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and largely faithful to the original. It conveys the technical concepts clearly and reads naturally, with some minor stylistic and consistency issues that do not significantly hinder comprehension. The overall quality is high, suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience who is familiar with AI terminology. Improvements could focus on consistency of terminology and tightening of sentence flow, as well as a consistent show name throughout the script. Overall, it is an effective translation that meets most evaluation criteria satisfactorily, earning a solid overall score of 16/20. The translation balances clarity, technical accuracy, and naturalness, making it a useful resource for listeners seeking to understand AI learning processes in a conversational format. The key takeaway is that while the translation is very good, a few refinements would elevate it to near‑perfect quality. The evaluation reflects a nuanced assessment of each dimension, acknowledging both strengths and areas for improvement. The final score is an average of the individual criteria, resulting in a total of 16 out of 20. This reflects the translation’s overall competence while recognizing room for minor enhancements in consistency and style."
