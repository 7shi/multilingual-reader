  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable but suffers from long, convoluted sentences and several literal‑translation fragments that make the flow awkward. Some key ideas are still clear, yet the sentence structure often feels clunky, especially in the sections that insert parenthetical explanations or switch tense abruptly. The overall readability is therefore moderate.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains numerous unnatural expressions (e.g., *«Aprendizaje de Características Inteligentes»*, *«en un contexto específico en acción»*), odd word orders, and occasional missing accents or agreement errors. While some parts read smoothly, many sections feel stilted or overly literal, diminishing naturalness for native readers. Fluency is thus fair to low.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key AI terms are inconsistently handled: *pre-entrenamiento* and *ajuste fino* are mostly correct, but *in‑context learning* is mistranslated as *Aprendizaje en Contexto* and then later as *Aprendizaje de Características Inteligentes*, which is incorrect. The translation does not consistently use standard terminology and sometimes invents terms. Therefore, terminology accuracy is limited.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The text largely retains the original conversational tone but fails to adapt several cultural references or idiomatic expressions. The Spanish adaptation includes many literal translations that do not resonate naturally with Spanish-speaking audiences. It also inserts unnecessary explanatory notes that disrupt the flow. Contextual adaptation is therefore acceptable but not optimal.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The bulk of the content from the original is present; the translation does not omit major concepts. However, some technical explanations are either misrepresented (e.g., the definition of ICL) or confused, and there are redundant phrases. Overall, the information is largely complete, albeit with some inaccuracies.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the overall narrative and most of the ideas, but it is marred by frequent literal translations, awkward phrasing, and several terminology mistakes that could confuse a Spanish‑speaking audience. While the information is largely intact, the readability, fluency, and precision of technical terms need significant improvement to reach a professional‑level standard."
