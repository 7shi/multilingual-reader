    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and uses simple sentence structures. However, some phrases are slightly awkward (e.g., *del bachotage*), and the unintended repetition *Lo olvida todo. Ella lo olvida todo.* creates a small disruption in flow. Overall, the target audience can understand the content without much effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads well in many parts, but there are noticeable unnatural constructions: *del bachotage*, *Lo olvida todo*, and the extra speaker *Ella*. These deviations from natural Spanish usage reduce fluency. Additionally, occasional missing capitalization or punctuation (e.g., *¡hasta* instead of *¡Hasta*) slightly affect naturalness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *anclaje*, *memoria*. The terminology is consistent throughout the script. The only slight misstep is *del bachotage*, which is a literal but non‑idiomatic rendering of *bachotage*.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The core intent of the podcast is preserved, but the brand name *Tech Éclair* was partially translated to *Tecnología Relámpago* in the opening while later kept unchanged at the end, causing inconsistency. Cultural adaptation of idioms is adequate except for the literal *del bachotage*. Overall, the adaptation is acceptable but could be smoother.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant omissions were found. The extra speaker line is a minor issue but does not drop any key information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid overall, accurately conveying the technical concepts and dialogue. Minor fluency issues and the inconsistent handling of the brand name detract slightly from the polish. With a few edits to naturalize some phrasing and align the brand reference, it would reach near‑perfect quality. The effort demonstrates a good grasp of both source and target languages and preserves the original meaning and tone effectively, making it useful for Spanish‑speaking audiences interested in AI and machine learning topics. The translation is recommended for publication after minor revisions to address the noted issues, such as correcting *del bachotage*, removing the redundant *Ella* line, and standardizing the brand name throughout the episode."
