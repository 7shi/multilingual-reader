  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally clear and follows a logical sentence structure that is easy to follow for native readers. The explanation of technical concepts is straightforward, and the dialogue format is preserved. Minor issues arise with some phrasing that could be tightened (e.g., “la IA no tiene ni idea de lo que se había dicho antes” is a bit informal for a podcast script). Overall, the text is readable and comprehensible.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly and sounds natural for Spanish speakers. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary. A few slightly awkward phrases exist, such as “partes de un contexto vacío” (where “parte” would be more idiomatic) and “la IA no se ajusta constantemente a través de sus conversaciones” (better phrased as “de sus conversaciones”). These do not impede understanding but slightly affect fluency.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled largely correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", \"Memoria\". The term \"fine‑tuning\" is rendered as \"refinamiento\", which is understandable but not the most common translation (\"ajuste fino\" or \"entrenamiento fino\" would be clearer). Terminology is consistent across the text, with no major omissions or errors.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references are adapted appropriately (e.g., using Spanish punctuation and exclamatory style). The adaptation is faithful to the source while sounding natural to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor cultural adjustments could be made in colloquial expressions, but they are acceptable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present. No essential information is omitted, and the script maintains its length and balance. A very small nuance—“una antisèche” was rendered as “un resumen”—does not change the meaning. The translation is concise and clear, with no unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It conveys the original content accurately, maintains a natural and engaging tone, and handles technical terminology appropriately. A few minor phrasing adjustments could improve fluency and align terminology more closely with common Spanish usage, but the script is ready for use in a Spanish‑language podcast context without significant revisions."
