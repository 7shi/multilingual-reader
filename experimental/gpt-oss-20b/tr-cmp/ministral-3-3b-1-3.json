  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text contains numerous incomplete sentences and missing context, making it difficult for a reader to follow the flow. Several lines are abruptly cut off (e.g., \"Camille: ¡Hola y bienvenidos\"), and key explanatory sections from the original are omitted. As a result, overall comprehensibility is compromised, though basic vocabulary remains recognizable. Score: 8/20.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many phrases sound unnatural or directly lifted from the source without adaptation, leading to awkward constructions (e.g., \"preentrenamiento\", \"imagine...\" left untranslated). The style is inconsistent, with some sentences overly literal and others missing verb conjugations. This reduces the naturalness of the text. Score: 6/20.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"finetuning\" are present, but their usage is inconsistent and sometimes incorrect (e.g., \"afinado\" instead of \"ajuste fino\" or \"finetuning\"). Some key terms from the source are omitted entirely, and explanations that help non‑technical readers are missing. Consistency across the transcript is lacking. Score: 10/20.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to adapt idiomatic expressions and cultural references to Spanish‑speaking audiences. For instance, the metaphor about a graduate is not fully rendered, and phrases like \"lever le voile\" are not translated. The dialogue tone does not reflect the original conversational style. Score: 5/20.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original transcript are missing or truncated (e.g., entire exchanges between Camille and Luc are omitted). The summary of concepts like ICL and memory functions is incomplete, leading to gaps in the narrative. No additional context is supplied to compensate. Score: 4/20.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is significantly deficient in several critical aspects. It lacks completeness, contains many unfinished or poorly translated segments, and fails to preserve the natural flow of the original French dialogue. Terminology usage is inconsistent, and contextual adaptation is largely absent. Overall, the translation would not provide a satisfying or accurate listening experience for Spanish‑speaking audiences. A thorough rewrite with attention to detail, cultural nuance, and technical consistency is required to bring the quality up to acceptable standards."
