    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely intelligible and follows the original dialogue structure. Sentences are generally clear, but a few awkward phrasings—such as “aprendizaje en contexto dentro del contexto” and the use of slang “crunchar” to translate *bachotage*—create minor confusion. The flow is logical, and complex ideas are usually explained, though the occasional literal translation of French terms (e.g., *apprentissage en contexte* as “aprendizaje en contexto dentro del contexto”) can momentarily disorient readers. Overall, it remains understandable but not perfectly polished.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly in most places, but several expressions feel unnatural or too literal for native Spanish speakers. Examples include “aprendizaje en contexto dentro del contexto”, “crunchar” (which is slang and not appropriate here), and the alternating use of *afinado* and *tuning* without clear distinction. Vocabulary is generally contemporary, but these idiosyncrasies interrupt the flow. Thus, the translation is fluent but could be more natural.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved (e.g., *pre-entrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*). However, inconsistencies appear: *apprentissage en contexte* becomes “aprendizaje en contexto dentro del contexto”; *grounding* is sometimes left untranslated; *tuning* is used interchangeably with *afinado* without clarification. The slang *crunchar* is a wrong substitute for *bachotage*. Consistency and precision would improve the terminology score.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue style is preserved and cultural references remain appropriate for a Spanish-speaking audience. Yet, the translation sometimes sticks too closely to the French wording, e.g., “aprendizaje en contexto dentro del contexto”, which feels forced. Cultural adaptation is adequate, but the linguistic style could be more idiomatic. The intended purpose is still conveyed, but minor adjustments would enhance resonance with Spanish listeners.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No significant content is omitted, and the narrative flow remains intact. Some phrasing choices create redundancy or slight ambiguity, but overall the information is complete and concise.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation faithfully reproduces the dialogue and conveys the core ideas, but it contains several awkward or incorrect expressions that hinder readability and naturalness. Consistent terminology and more idiomatic phrasing would elevate the quality. With minor revisions—especially correcting the literal translations of *apprentissage en contexte* and *bachotage*—the text would become a smooth, professional adaptation for a Spanish-speaking audience."
