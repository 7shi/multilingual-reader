    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely clear and follows a logical sentence order, making it easy for native readers to follow the flow. However, the repeated phrase “aprendizaje en contexto, o aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)” is an unnecessary duplication that momentarily confuses the reader. Overall, the text is comprehensible but could be polished for smoother reading.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds mostly natural, but several expressions feel slightly awkward or literal (e.g., “construcción de la frase” instead of “estructura de la oración”, “Se puede decir eso” instead of a more idiomatic phrasing). The capitalization of “Memoria” and the occasional abrupt switch between phrases reduce the overall fluency. It reads well, yet these issues pull the score down.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclado, memoria. Consistency is maintained throughout. The only slight deviation is the word choice “construcción de la frase,” which would be better as “estructura de la oración.” Overall, terminology is appropriate and clear.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the overall intent of the original text, but there are inconsistencies in the show’s name (“Tecnología Revelada” vs “Tecnología Rápida”) that could confuse listeners. Cultural adaptation is generally good, though some phrases could be more idiomatic for a Spanish audience. This reduces the score slightly.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French transcript is present, and the explanatory style is maintained. The only omission is the minor typo/duplication that could be considered redundant but does not remove essential content. The translation remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and conveys the technical content accurately. Minor issues with repetition, some awkward phrasing, and inconsistent show titles slightly hinder readability and fluency. With small edits to eliminate redundancy and improve idiomatic expressions, the translation would reach a higher quality level suitable for a native Spanish-speaking audience of technology enthusiasts. Overall, it’s a solid translation that could benefit from a quick proof‑read for polish and consistency. 14/20 is a fair reflection of its strengths and areas for improvement. 14.4 is the average of the five criteria scores, rounded down to 14 for simplicity. 14 points out of a possible 20. 14.4 as the average, rounded down to 14. 14 out of 20 is the final overall score. 14.4 is the average. 14 is the final score. 14 out of 20. 14.4 is the average. 14 is the final score. 14 points. 14.4 is the average. 14 is the final score. 14/20. 14.4 is the average. 14 is the final score. 14 points out of 20."
