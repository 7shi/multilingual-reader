    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely comprehensible; sentence structure is logical and the key ideas from the original are conveyed. Minor issues include a slightly abrupt transition in the sentence “La IA no ha « olvidado »…”, but overall the audience can follow the content without confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but a few phrases feel slightly awkward or literal, such as \"Lo han entendido todo.\" (should be \"Lo has entendido todo.\") and \"Si quiero que tenga conocimiento de las mismas informaciones mañana…\" (the wording could be smoother). The overall flow remains smooth though.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms like preentrenamiento, afinamiento, ICL, anclaje, ventana de contexto, memoria a corto plazo are correctly rendered. The terminology is consistent and appropriate for a general audience, and no crucial terms are omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and style, and localizes greeting phrases and cultural references adequately. The Spanish version preserves the conversational tone of the podcast. Minor adjustments could improve cultural resonance, but the current adaptation works well.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present, with no significant omissions. The Spanish text sometimes repeats ideas (e.g., the explanation of temporary memory), but this redundancy is minimal and does not detract from clarity.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is accurate and largely readable, but contains a handful of grammatical and stylistic quirks that slightly detract from naturalness. Overall, it serves its purpose well and conveys the original meaning effectively, with only minor refinements needed for a flawless, polished version. The final evaluation reflects a strong but not perfect translation, suitable for general audience consumption with a few edits for native fluency.\n\nAverage score: 17.4/20 (out of 20 points)."
