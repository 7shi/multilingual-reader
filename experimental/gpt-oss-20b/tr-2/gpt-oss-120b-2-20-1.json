  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is mostly clear and follows the original dialogue structure. Sentences are logically ordered and the conversational style is preserved, allowing native listeners to understand the concepts without difficulty. Some minor repetitions (e.g., “Se olvida de todo” followed by “Se olvida de todo” again) slightly disrupt flow but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for Spanish speakers. Grammar is correct and vocabulary is contemporary. Occasional awkwardness appears in phrases such as \"la destreza está consolidada\" which feels slightly literal; a more idiomatic choice could improve smoothness. Overall, the text flows well.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"grounding\" (translated as \"anclaje\"). Consistency is maintained throughout. Minor improvement: the term \"Memoria\" could be clarified as a feature, but it is understandable in context.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The tone of a podcast host conversation is well preserved. Cultural references are minimal, but the translation respects Spanish-speaking audiences by using colloquial yet professional language. Minor adaptation could involve simplifying some long French idioms into more natural Spanish equivalents, but overall intent is conveyed accurately.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original is present. No key points are omitted, and supplemental explanations are provided where needed (e.g., clarifying \"grounding\"). Redundancy is minimal, keeping the dialogue concise while informative.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation demonstrates a strong grasp of both the source text and target language conventions. It remains faithful to the original, maintains natural flow, and uses appropriate technical terminology. Minor stylistic tweaks could further enhance readability, but overall the translation is of high quality and suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience in a podcast context. Average score: 18.2/20, rounded to 18/20 for simplicity. The translator effectively balances literal accuracy with cultural adaptation, ensuring clarity and engagement for listeners. The final product is ready for broadcast with only minor polishing required for perfect fluency. If you need a more idiomatic touch or a specific dialectal adjustment, let me know and I can refine the text accordingly."
