  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version follows the original dialogue structure and presents the concepts in a clear, linear way. Long sentences are broken into shorter ones, and explanations of technical ideas are generally easy to understand. Minor readability issues arise from slightly wordy phrases, but overall a native reader can follow the conversation without confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation reads smoothly, but there are a few spots that feel awkward or overly literal. For example, \"la IA no se ve constantemente afinada a través de sus conversaciones\" and \"Esto sería ineficiente\" sound a bit stilted compared to native Spanish. Overall, however, the text feels natural and the vocabulary is contemporary.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly preserved: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"grounding\" (translated as \"anclaje\"). Some inconsistencies appear: the term \"fine‑tuning\" is translated as \"ajuste fino\" in one place and then omitted later, while \"afinamiento\" is used for the same concept. These inconsistencies could confuse a reader familiar with the terminology.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the overall intent and cultural flavor of the original. Expressions such as \"Hola y bienvenida\" and the use of the podcast name are appropriate. Slightly informal phrasings like \"Tienes todo claro\" fit the conversational tone. No major cultural mismatches were detected.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. There are no omissions, and the translation does not add irrelevant content. Minor repetition is present but does not hinder understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is generally solid and faithful to the original. Readability and fluency are strong, though a few phrases could be polished for a more natural feel. Terminology is mostly accurate but would benefit from consistent use of key terms. The translation captures the intent and cultural nuance of the source, and all information is preserved. With minor adjustments, it would be a near‑perfect adaptation."
