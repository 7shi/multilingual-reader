  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text follows a clear, linear structure that mirrors the original. Sentences are mostly short and the narrative flow is easy to follow. However, occasional plural‑singular mismatches (e.g., “informaciones” instead of “información”) and some redundant phrasing slightly reduce readability. Overall, the translation remains comprehensible to a general audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most expressions sound natural and the vocabulary is contemporary. Some awkwardness appears in a few areas: \"fundamentación\" for \"grounding\" feels a bit formal, \"una trampa\" for \"antisèche\" is a rough metaphor, and the alternation between \"prompt\" and \"solicitud\" can feel inconsistent. Despite these minor issues, the text reads smoothly overall.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are largely preserved (pre-entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, ventana de contexto, memoria). \"Grounding\" was rendered as \"fundamentación\", which is understandable but not the most common translation; a more precise choice would be \"anclaje\". The use of both \"prompt\" and \"solicitud\" is inconsistent, which may confuse readers who are not familiar with the English term. Still, the terminology is mostly accurate and consistent otherwise.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and sense, and uses Spanish idiomatic expressions where appropriate (e.g., comparing the AI to a consultant). Cultural references are neutral and fit a general Spanish‑speaking audience. Some phrases could be refined for better local flavor, but the overall contextual adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the source text are present; no content is omitted. The translator retained the dialogue structure and the explanatory style. Minor additions (e.g., clarifying \"prompt\" vs \"solicitud\") help comprehension, and redundancy is generally avoided. Thus, the translation is fully complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and largely faithful to the original French script. It conveys the main ideas, keeps the conversational tone, and uses appropriate technical language for a general audience. A few word choices could be improved for smoother fluency and consistency, particularly around the translation of \"grounding\" and the handling of \"prompt\" vs \"solicitud\". With minor edits, it would be near‑perfect for a Spanish‑speaking listener of the podcast.\n\nOverall, a competent and clear translation that serves its purpose well, with room for small refinements to polish the linguistic style further.  Score: 16/20.\n\nReasoning:\n- Readability: 16 – clear structure, minor plural/singular mismatch.\n- Fluency: 15 – generally smooth, some awkward metaphor and term alternation.\n- Terminology: 14 – most terms correct, but \"grounding\" and \"prompt\" handling could be better.\n- Contextual adaptation: 16 – tone and cultural adaptation fine.\n- Information completeness: 18 – no omissions, concise.\n- Overall score: 16/20."
