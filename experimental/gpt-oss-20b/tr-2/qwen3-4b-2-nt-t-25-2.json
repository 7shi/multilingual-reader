    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and follows the original structure. However, there are small typographical and grammatical errors that can momentarily confuse readers, e.g., “re aprender” instead of “reaprender” and the phrase “se envía una IA completamente nueva” which could be more naturally phrased. Overall sentence flow is logical but occasionally disrupted by these mistakes.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences read smoothly for a native Spanish speaker, but there are several awkward expressions and minor inconsistencies: “Olvida todo” is correct but the surrounding context uses quotation marks unnecessarily; “la IA no ha « olvidado » en el sentido humano” feels clunky. The translation generally uses appropriate vocabulary, yet these small issues reduce overall naturalness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto* (ICL), and *grounding* (anclaje) are correctly rendered and consistent throughout. Minor variations (“ajuste fino” vs. “afinado”) do not affect understanding. Terminology handling is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the podcast style and adapted most expressions for a Spanish audience, but a few cultural or idiomatic adjustments are missing or incorrect: “bienvenido en 'Tech Éclair'” should be “bienvenido a 'Tech Éclair'”. Generally, the adaptation is adequate but not flawless.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French transcript are present, including pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, context‑window learning, grounding, memory, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No substantive content is omitted; the translation stays concise yet comprehensive.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the core ideas and technical concepts accurately, with a solid handling of terminology. However, several small typographical and grammatical errors, along with occasional awkward phrasing, detract from readability and fluency. With minor revisions to address these issues, the translation would reach a high standard of quality for a native Spanish-speaking audience.\n\nOverall, a competent translation that could benefit from a careful copy‑edit to polish the language and correct minor mistakes.\n\nAverage Score: 16/20 (out of 20).  The score reflects the translation’s strengths in terminology and completeness, balanced against its weaknesses in fluency and minor errors in readability and contextual adaptation.\n\n\n\n\nScore: 16/20"
