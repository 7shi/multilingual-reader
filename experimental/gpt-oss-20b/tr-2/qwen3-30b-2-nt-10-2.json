    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured, and technical concepts are explained in a straightforward manner. Minor issues such as the phrase “Lo has entendido todo” (missing an accent on *lo* in some copies) and a few slightly awkward turns do not significantly impede comprehension. Overall, readers can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for most of the text, with appropriate word choices and idiomatic expressions. Some small grammatical slips and the inconsistent use of hyphenation in terms like *pre-entrenamiento* slightly affect naturalness. Additionally, the phrase “Lo has entendido todo” feels informal and could be tightened. Nonetheless, the text remains fluid and natural for a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms such as *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, and *aprendizaje en contexto* are correctly rendered. However, the translation of *grounding* as *fundamentación* is inaccurate; *anclaje* or *enraizamiento* would be more appropriate. The hyphenated *pre-entrenamiento* deviates from the common Spanish spelling *preentrenamiento*. Overall, terminology is mostly accurate but shows a few inconsistencies.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and style of a conversational podcast. Cultural references are minimal, so no major adjustments were needed. The use of Spanish equivalents for English terms maintains the original feel, and the dialogue flows naturally. Some expressions could be refined for better cultural resonance, but the adaptation is largely effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the material from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and redundancies are kept minimal. The translation accurately conveys every nuance, including the distinction between context‑based learning and fine‑tuning, and the discussion of memory features. Thus, information completeness is very high.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, capturing the technical content and conversational tone of the original podcast. Minor issues in terminology and a few slightly awkward phrasings slightly detract from perfect fluency, but the overall readability and fidelity remain strong. With small refinements—particularly in the translation of *grounding* and consistent hyphenation—the text would reach a near‑perfect standard for native Spanish audiences."
