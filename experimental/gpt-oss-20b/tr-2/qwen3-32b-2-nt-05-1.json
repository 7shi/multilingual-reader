    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and follows a logical structure.  Sentences are generally well‑formed and complex concepts are explained in a way that a Spanish‑speaking listener can understand.  Minor readability issues arise from slightly awkward phrasing such as *“la IA no tiene ninguna idea de lo que se dijo”* which feels clumsy but does not hinder comprehension.  Overall the text is easy to follow.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several expressions are slightly forced or unidiomatic—for instance *“una hoja de apuntes”* and *“la IA no tiene ninguna idea”*.  Some grammatical choices (e.g., plural pronouns “sus conversaciones” instead of “tus conversaciones”) and repetition of *“la IA no olvida”* reduce the flow.  Nonetheless, the majority of the dialogue reads smoothly and the vocabulary is contemporary and appropriate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto* and *memoria a corto plazo* are correctly translated and consistently used throughout.  The translator preserves the original meaning while keeping terms accessible to a general audience.  No significant mistranslations or omissions were noted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French dialogue to Spanish cultural expectations with minimal loss of intent.  Expressions are localized appropriately (e.g., *“consultor brillante”* instead of *“consultor experto”*).  A few sentences could be refined for better local flavor, but the overall purpose and tone are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, anchoring, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge.  The translator did not omit any critical detail and added clarifying phrases where necessary.  The only redundancy is the repeated emphasis that the model “olvida” after a conversation, but this does not detract from clarity.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely faithful and readable, capturing the main ideas and technical concepts accurately.  Some phrases feel slightly unnatural and there are a few grammatical quirks that could be smoothed out.  With minor adjustments, the Spanish version would read as smoothly and professionally as the original French.  Overall, it is a high‑quality translation that would serve a Spanish‑speaking audience well.\n\nOverall score: 88/100 (sum of individual scores)."
