  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely readable and follows the original flow. Sentences are long but understandable. Some explanations of complex concepts are clear, though a few technical phrases feel slightly dense for a general audience. Overall, readers can grasp the content without major confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text generally sounds natural, but there are several spots with awkward wording or literal translations, e.g. \"el marco de contexto de la IA\" instead of a more idiomatic \"el marco de contexto\" or \"el contexto de la IA\". Phrases like \"para una conversación única\" feel clunky. Some capitalization (ICL) and redundant words reduce smoothness. Native speakers might spot these quirks.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly translated: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje. The translation stays consistent and the terms are suitable for a tech‑savvy audience. Minor issues: \"Lenguaje de Modelado de Contexto Grande\" is a literal and unclear rendering of \"Large‑Context Modeling Language\". Overall, terminology handling is solid.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent of the original is preserved. The translation respects the podcast style and keeps the conversational tone. Cultural references are minimal, so no significant adaptation needed. A few phrases could be more localized (e.g., \"consultor experto\" instead of \"consultor brillante\"), but overall the message matches the target audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory. The Spanish version doesn't omit any major points. Some extra explanatory phrases were added, which help understanding without excessive redundancy. Minor nuance about memory mechanisms might be slightly flattened, but the core information is intact.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is well‑executed overall, faithfully conveying the original meaning and technical content. Minor fluency issues and a few literal phrasing choices detract from the smoothness for native speakers. With a few adjustments, the Spanish text would read as naturally as the French source while maintaining accuracy and clarity for a tech‑interested audience, earning a strong overall score around 16–17 out of 20 for this episode's transcript. The evaluation also highlights the most impactful areas for improvement: polishing awkward idioms and refining terminology usage to enhance readability and naturalness."
