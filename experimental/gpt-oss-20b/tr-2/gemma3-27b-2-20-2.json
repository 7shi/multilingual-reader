  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and easy to follow. The overall structure mimics the original conversational format, making it comprehensible for native readers. However, the introduction of the acronym AIC for In‑Context Learning (ICL) without first explaining the original acronym creates a small moment of confusion. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., “para que se especialice” instead of “para que se especialice” is redundant) slightly interrupt the flow. Overall, readability remains strong but not perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly and sounds natural in most parts. Phrases such as “se puede decir eso” and “sistema más inteligente” are idiomatic. Some awkward constructions appear, like “La IA no se perfecciona continuamente por tus conversaciones” which could be better phrased as “La IA no se perfecciona continuamente con tus conversaciones.” Overall, the text feels coherent and fluent for Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly – pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste preciso, aprendizaje en contexto. Nevertheless, “ajuste preciso” is less common than “ajuste fino”; the abrupt switch to AIC for the ICL acronym may confuse readers unfamiliar with the original abbreviation. The consistency of terminology could be improved, but the meaning is still conveyed.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation keeps the original intent and tone, translating idioms appropriately and localizing the podcast title. The cultural context is respected, and expressions such as “consultor brillante” fit a Spanish audience. The only slight mismatch is the inconsistent acronym (ICL vs AIC), which could distract readers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the consultant versus permanent expert analogy. No substantive omissions or additions alter the message. The translation remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the core ideas of the original French script effectively. Readability and fluency are solid, with only minor linguistic quirks. Terminology and contextual consistency could be tightened slightly, particularly regarding the handling of acronyms and the choice of terms like “ajuste preciso.” Despite these small issues, the translation is of high quality and suitable for a native Spanish audience."
