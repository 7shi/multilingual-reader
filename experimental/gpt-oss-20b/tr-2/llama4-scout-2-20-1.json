  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally easy to follow, with clear explanations of complex ideas such as pre‑training and in‑context learning. Sentence structures are mostly straightforward, and the dialogue format is preserved, which aids comprehension. Some sentences are slightly long or contain minor syntactic awkwardness, but overall the text remains readable for native Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several literal or slightly awkward phrasings that interrupt the natural flow—for example, “El ajuste… ahí es donde entra en juego el aprendizaje por transferencia” and the parenthetical “Esto es la realidad de ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”. Word choices are mostly appropriate, but the text would benefit from smoother, more idiomatic phrasing in places. Consequently, fluency is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally handled correctly: pre‑training is rendered as ‘entrenamiento previo’ (with a brief footnote), fine‑tuning as ‘ajuste fino’, and context window as ‘ventana de contexto’. However, some terms appear inconsistently—both ‘pre‑entrenamiento’ and ‘entrenamiento previo’ are used, and ‘grounding’ is translated as ‘anclaje’ without clarifying the distinction. Overall, terminology is appropriate but could be more consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator has adapted expressions to be culturally appropriate for Spanish‑speaking audiences, adding explanatory notes where needed and adjusting idiomatic references (e.g., comparing learning to “prepararse para un examen”). The spirit and intent of the original are preserved, and the dialogue remains engaging. Minor over‑explanations and some redundant clarifications slightly detract from the adaptation’s polish.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are present in the Spanish version: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the concept of memory, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. No substantive content is omitted. Minor differences in phrasing do not alter meaning, and the translation remains concise while keeping the key details.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation faithfully conveys the content and intent of the original French script. Readability and information completeness are strong, but fluency suffers from a few literal and awkward expressions, and terminology consistency could be improved. With some polishing of phrasing and standardization of key terms, the text would read more naturally and professionally for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
