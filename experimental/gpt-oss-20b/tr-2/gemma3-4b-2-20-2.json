  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is mostly understandable and follows a logical flow similar to the original. However, many stray characters (e.g., `}**`, `{`), missing accents, and a few awkward sentence structures interrupt the reader’s experience. The core ideas are clear, but these typographical and syntactical errors lower overall readability.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains several unnatural expressions and occasional direct borrowing from French (e.g., \"bachoter\"), as well as awkward punctuation. While the vocabulary is generally appropriate, the overall flow feels choppy, and the presence of stray markup hinders smooth reading.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"ajuste fino\" (fine‑tuning), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", and \"anclaje\" are correctly used. Some terms lack brief explanation for a lay audience, and a few phrases (e.g., \"In‑Context Learning\") are repeated without nuance. Overall, terminology is accurate but could benefit from slight elaboration.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator attempts to localize idioms (e.g., comparing an AI to a graduate), but the result sometimes feels literal or awkward. Cultural references are generally preserved, but the translation misses some opportunities for smoother adaptation, and a few phrases remain too close to the source wording, reducing naturalness for Spanish listeners.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation includes all major ideas from the original—pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory mechanics, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. Minor omissions are negligible, but stray characters create minor confusion. Overall, the content is complete.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main concepts and is generally understandable, but it is marred by typographical errors, awkward phrasing, and a few mistranslated or untranslated words. A careful proofreading and polishing would significantly improve readability, fluency, and overall quality. It is suitable as a draft but requires revision for publication or professional use."
