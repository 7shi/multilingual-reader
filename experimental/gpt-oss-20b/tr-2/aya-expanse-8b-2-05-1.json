    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely comprehensible and follows a logical sentence structure. The main ideas are conveyed clearly, and technical concepts are introduced in a way that a non‑expert audience can follow. However, a few sentences (e.g., “Cuando abres una nueva ventana, comienzas de cero en términos de contexto para la IA”) feel slightly awkward and could benefit from smoother phrasing. Overall, the readability is good with minor room for improvement.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural to native Spanish speakers, but there are several instances of awkward phrasing and repetition. Expressions like “El aprendizaje contextual es similar a copiar para un examen” and “El modelo no aprende ni evoluciona” could be refined for smoother flow. Punctuation and article usage are sometimes inconsistent, which mildly disrupts the reading experience. Nonetheless, the text reads smoothly most of the time.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL*, *anclaje* and *memoria a corto plazo* are correctly translated and consistently used. The bilingual note for *fine‑tuning* as *ajuste fino* and the explanation of ICL are appropriate. The terminology is clear for a general audience, though a few redundancies (“El modelo no aprende ni evoluciona”) slightly dilute precision.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Cultural references and idioms are adapted appropriately (e.g., “¡Saludos y bienvenidos…”, “¡Y yo soy Luc!”). The translation keeps the podcast tone and conversational style of the original. Some expressions could be more localized (e.g., using “¡Hola!” instead of “¡Saludos!”), but overall the adaptation suits Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French source are retained: the stages of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, transfer learning, the temporary nature of ICL, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. Minor redundancy is present, but no significant content is omitted. The translation effectively conveys the same informational load as the original.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid, conveying the original message and technical concepts with clarity. Readability and terminology are strong, while fluency suffers from occasional awkward phrasing and repetition. Contextual adaptation is good, and the information remains complete. With minor polishing for natural flow, the translation would reach near‑perfect quality. Overall, it is a competent rendering suitable for the target audience, but could be refined for maximum naturalness and conciseness."
