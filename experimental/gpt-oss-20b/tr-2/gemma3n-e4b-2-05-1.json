  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version maintains a clear and logical sentence structure that is easy to follow for native readers. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in straightforward language. Minor long sentences could be split for greater clarity, but overall readability is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds generally natural and smooth. However, there are a few awkward phrasings and an inconsistent use of formal and informal registers (e.g., switching between \"tus\" and \"vuestras\"). Some sentences feel slightly literal and could be polished for a more native flow. Overall, fluency is strong but not flawless.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"ventana de contexto\" are used correctly and consistently. Explanations are adequate for the intended audience. The only slight issue is the inconsistent formality mentioned above. Terminology is handled very well.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original tone and purpose of a podcast introduction. Cultural references are adapted appropriately (e.g., using \"consultor\" instead of a literal term). The conversational style suits Spanish‑speaking listeners. Some minor adjustments could improve the local flavor, but overall contextual adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French script is preserved. No essential content is omitted, and the translation does not introduce unnecessary redundancies. The only slight repetition appears in the discussion of memory features, but it mirrors the original dialogue. The completeness is therefore high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is overall very competent and faithful to the source text.
