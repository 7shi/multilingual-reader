  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely comprehensible to a native reader. The dialogue structure is preserved and most ideas are easy to follow. However, several phrases are awkwardly constructed (“en la Internet”, “una cantidad muy menos”, “apoyan en fundamentos”) which can momentarily confuse readers. Thus the overall readability is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains numerous grammatical and stylistic errors that break the flow for native speakers. Common mistakes such as missing prepositions, wrong verb forms, and unnatural word choices (“reprobarle”, “en segundo plano”) make the text feel choppy. Although the basic meaning is clear, the lack of natural phrasing lowers the fluency score.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are translated correctly (e.g., preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning, ICL). Nevertheless, some terms are misapplied or inconsistent: \"apoyan en fundamentos\" should be \"se apoya en\"; \"grounding\" rendered as \"anclaje\" is acceptable but could be better contextualized. The overall terminology is appropriate but not consistently polished.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation maintains the original intent and keeps cultural references intact. Minor issues such as the mismatched podcast name at the end (“Tech Éclair”) and the use of French quotation marks instead of Spanish ones slightly weaken the adaptation. Overall, the contextual conveyance is strong.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation includes all the information from the source text. No substantive content is omitted, though some phrases are slightly altered (e.g., “la IA no se afinada” instead of “la IA no se afina”). The level of detail is maintained, and redundancy is minimal.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is comprehensible and largely faithful to the source, but it suffers from frequent grammatical slips and unnatural phrasing that affect readability and fluency. The terminology is mostly correct, though a few inconsistencies appear. With some careful copy‑editing and a few cultural adjustments, the translation could achieve a higher standard of polish and naturalness for a native Spanish audience. The core message and technical concepts are preserved, ensuring that listeners would grasp the content as intended by the original French podcast script. The total score reflects solid performance with room for improvement in fluency and stylistic precision. Overall, it is a usable translation that would benefit from a final proofread to remove the residual errors and improve natural flow."
