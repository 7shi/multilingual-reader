    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish transcript is largely easy to follow. Sentence structure is largely faithful to the French original and readers can grasp the technical concepts. Minor readability issues arise from a few awkwardly translated phrases such as *“es del aplastar”* and the erroneous word *“Tale”*, which momentarily confuse the flow. Overall the text remains comprehensible, but the small hiccups prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for most of the text. However, there are occasional unnatural expressions – for example *“es del aplastar”* and *“Tale es la realidad de ICL”* – which break the natural rhythm for native speakers. The punctuation and some article usage (e.g., *“gran pregunta”* missing *la*) also affect fluency slightly. The vocabulary choices are generally appropriate and contemporary.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje en contexto* (ICL), *anclaje*, and *memoria* are consistently translated and are understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only minor issue is the retention of the English term *grounding* in parentheses, which could have been rendered as *“fundamentación”* or *“anclaje”* consistently. Overall, terminology is handled well.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the cultural context appropriately – for instance, the use of *“consultor brillante”* and the analogy of a bike instructor fit the Spanish audience. The adaptation retains the informal, conversational tone of a podcast. There are no culturally inappropriate expressions. Small improvements could be made in idiomatic phrasing, but the intent and purpose are effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French transcript appear in the Spanish version. No critical information is omitted, and the order of ideas is preserved. Minor supplementary explanations were not added, keeping the translation concise. Thus the information completeness is high.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and mostly faithful to the original French script. The content is well‑structured, technically accurate, and largely natural to Spanish‑speaking listeners. The few awkward phrasings and the small typographical mistake with *Tale* are the main drawbacks, but they do not significantly hinder comprehension. With minor polishing, the translation would reach an excellent level of quality."
