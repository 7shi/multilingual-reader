  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue is generally easy to follow and the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are clear. Minor sentence fragments and slightly awkward phrasing (e.g., “¿Porque lo ha adquirido?”) slightly reduce the flow, but overall readers can understand the content.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds mostly natural for a native Spanish speaker, but several expressions are slightly off (“¿Es una estrategia?” instead of “¿Es una táctica?”) and some punctuation is missing. These issues lower the fluency slightly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately translated: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, memoria. Consistency is good, though the compound “preentrenamiento” would be better as “pre‑entrenamiento”.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and conversational tone are preserved, but the program title switches inconsistently between “Tecnología al Instante” and “Tech Éclair”, which may confuse listeners. Cultural adaptation is adequate otherwise.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all original content is retained; no major omissions. The explanation of how ICL works, the comparison to fine‑tuning, and the discussion about memory are all present.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful and understandable, conveying the key concepts and dialogue. Minor issues—such as inconsistent naming of the show, a few awkward phrasings, and punctuation irregularities—reduce its polish. A final review to harmonize the title and smooth some expressions would bring it to near‑perfect quality, but it is already functional and clear for Spanish‑speaking listeners."
