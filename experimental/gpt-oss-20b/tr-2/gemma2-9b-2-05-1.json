  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. The sentence structure is logical and most concepts are explained in a straightforward way. Minor hiccups such as inconsistent capitalization of *la IA* and occasional wordy phrasing slightly reduce readability, but overall the target audience can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds largely natural to a Spanish speaker, but there are a few awkward or incorrect constructions. For example, *la IA no está constantemente refinada por sus conversaciones* is not idiomatic, and *Esta función de memorización son una forma astuta* has a grammatical error. These issues, together with inconsistent use of *aprendizaje contextual* versus *aprendizaje en contexto*, reduce the fluency score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are translated correctly: *pre-entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *grounding* → *anclaje*, *ICL* → *aprendizaje en contexto*. The only inconsistency is the use of *aprendizaje contextual* in place of *aprendizaje en contexto* in some parts, which may confuse readers familiar with the standard term. Overall, terminology handling is solid but could be more consistent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the core meaning, but it introduces a change in the show’s name (*Tech Éclair* → *Tecnología Flash*), which is not necessary and may confuse listeners familiar with the brand. Additionally, the Spanish version sometimes uses expressions that are slightly more formal than the original conversational tone. The adaptation is acceptable but not optimal.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No essential content was omitted, and the translation adds no extraneous details that would compromise clarity. The length is roughly comparable, maintaining a good balance between conciseness and completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a strong grasp of the subject matter and conveys the technical concepts accurately. However, a few linguistic slips, inconsistent terminology, and the unnecessary change of the show’s name slightly detract from an otherwise clear and natural presentation. With minor revisions, the text could achieve a higher level of polish and fidelity to the original brand identity.\n\nOverall, the translation is competent and useful for a Spanish-speaking audience, but attention to consistency and natural phrasing would elevate its quality further.\n\nOverall score: 16/20 (average of the individual scores)."
