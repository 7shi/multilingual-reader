  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but several sentences contain literal word‑for‑word wording and awkward phrasing that can confuse readers. For example, \"Usted ha entendido todo\" is overly formal and slightly unnatural in this conversational context, and the comma in \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotage\" breaks the flow. Additionally, gender‑agreement errors such as \"estas conocimientos\" reduce clarity. Despite these issues, most ideas are still traceable, so the score is moderate.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Fluency suffers from multiple grammatical mistakes and unnatural expressions. Common mistakes include incorrect verb conjugation (e.g., \"Usted afinan\"), misplaced commas, and odd word order. Sentences like \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotage\" read more like a draft than polished prose. These problems hinder the smooth reading experience, so the score is relatively low.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved: *preentrenamiento*, *afinación*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *grounding*, *ICL*. The translations are accurate and consistent throughout the text. Minor improvements could be made (e.g., using *ajuste fino* instead of *afinación*), but overall the terminology is appropriate and clear for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to keep the original intent and conversational tone, but several phrases feel too literal or culturally misplaced. For instance, \"aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotage\" is not idiomatic Spanish, and \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotage\" could be better expressed as \"El aprendizaje en contexto es una forma de bachotaje.\" These issues slightly weaken the cultural adaptation, though the core meaning remains intact.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory features, and the consultant vs. permanent expert analogy. No significant omissions were detected, and redundant content was not introduced. Therefore the translation is quite complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation shows a solid grasp of the technical vocabulary and retains the original structure. However, numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and literal word‑for‑word transfers hinder readability and naturalness. Improving sentence structure and correcting syntax would markedly raise the overall quality, making the text more engaging for Spanish‑speaking listeners. The current version is acceptable for a draft but would need polishing before publication or broadcast. "
