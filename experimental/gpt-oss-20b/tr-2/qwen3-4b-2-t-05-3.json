  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the overall structure of the original. However, several sentences contain awkward phrasing or minor errors that can hinder comprehension for a native speaker (e.g., *« Hola y bienvenido en… »*, *« le presentas »*, *« le olvidó todo »*). These issues slightly reduce readability, but the main ideas are still clear.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation often feels stilted and contains grammatical inaccuracies such as *« le olvidó todo »* (should be *« la IA »*), missing accents, and wrong verb forms (*« se envía »* instead of *« se envía»*). Natural expressions like *« se atreviera »* and *« apretar »* are out of place. Overall fluency is compromised, so a moderate score is appropriate.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered: *preentrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)*, *grounding*. Consistency is maintained across the text. The only notable slip is the mistranslation of *bachoter* as *apretar*. Otherwise, terminology is accurate and suitable for the target audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural adjustments are minimal and generally adequate. Minor improvements could be made in idiomatic expressions (e.g., *« se atreviera »* could be *« se enfrentara »*), but the overall contextual adaptation is satisfactory.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French source is preserved. No critical content was omitted. Redundancies are minimal and do not detract from clarity. Therefore, the translation is largely complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is functional and conveys the key ideas of the original. However, repeated grammatical mistakes, unnatural phrasing, and a few mistranslations (e.g., *apretar* for *estudiar*) affect its polish. A revision to correct these issues would raise the overall quality substantially, bringing fluency and readability closer to native-level standards while preserving technical accuracy and contextual nuance. The translation is suitable for a general audience but would benefit from a careful proof‑read to eliminate residual errors and improve naturalness.  Overall, it is a solid effort that demonstrates a clear understanding of the source material but requires refinement to achieve a professional‑grade result."
