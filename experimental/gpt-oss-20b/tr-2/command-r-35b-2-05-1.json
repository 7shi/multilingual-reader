    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally easy to follow and the dialogue format is preserved.  The majority of sentences are comprehensible, and the key concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, memory) are explained in plain language.  However, a few grammatical slips (missing accents, odd word choices such as “Lo has pillado todo” and the interjection of French terms like “de même” or “antisèche”) slightly disrupt the flow.  These hiccups make the text a bit less smooth but do not render it unreadable.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the overall style is conversational, there are noticeable unnatural expressions and a handful of awkward phrasing.  The translation occasionally mixes French words that have not been translated (e.g., “de même”, “antisèche”), and some sentences have minor syntactic errors (“Lo has pillado todo”).  These issues reduce the native‑speaker naturalness of the text.  The vocabulary is otherwise contemporary and appropriate, but the fluency suffers from these inconsistencies.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *ICL*, and *anclaje* are correctly rendered.  The translator maintained consistent terminology for the key concepts.  Nevertheless, the presence of untranslated French words in a technical context (e.g., “de même”, “antisèche”) introduces confusion.  The overall handling of terminology is solid but marred by a few lapses.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapted the show name from “Tech Éclair” to “Destello Tecnológico”, which is an acceptable localization.  Cultural references are largely maintained, and the conversational tone is preserved.  However, the mixing of French words into the Spanish text weakens the contextual adaptation, as it may confuse Spanish‑speaking listeners.  A more thorough cleanup of such remnants would improve cultural coherence.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the essential storyline and technical explanations.  No major content is omitted, and the dialogue structure remains intact.  Minor changes in phrasing do not alter the meaning significantly.  The only potential loss is the nuanced description of the memory feature, which is slightly muddled by untranslated French terms, but the core information is still present.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful to the original French script and conveys the main ideas effectively.  The text is readable and understandable, and the key technical terminology is mostly correct.  However, the inclusion of French terms within the Spanish narrative and a few awkward phrasings detract from its overall fluency and contextual polish.  With minor revisions—removing the leftover French words, smoothing out the dialogue, and correcting small grammatical slips—the translation could reach a high‑quality standard."
