  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are structured logically and the main ideas from the original are conveyed. Minor issues such as the use of “deciframos” instead of the more common “desciframos” slightly reduce clarity, but the overall readability remains high.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker. However, some expressions feel slightly literal, e.g., “pues se percibe” and “pues se percibe” instead of the more idiomatic “se percibe”. There are also minor punctuation issues. Overall, the flow is natural but not perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled accurately and consistently: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “memoria a corto plazo”, etc. The translation keeps the terminology coherent with contemporary Spanish usage. Minor variations such as “anclaje” for “grounding” are acceptable. Consistency is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references are adapted appropriately (e.g., using the Spanish exclamation marks, local phrasing). Some colloquial expressions could be smoother, but the overall context is maintained and the listener’s perspective is considered.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines from the original are present, and no significant information is omitted. The translation keeps the same structure and length, with no redundant or missing segments. Minor stylistic tweaks were made but no content was lost.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and conveys the original meaning accurately. While readability and fluency are slightly below perfect due to a few literal phrasings and punctuation quirks, terminology and information completeness are handled exceptionally well. The overall quality is solid, suitable for a general audience."
