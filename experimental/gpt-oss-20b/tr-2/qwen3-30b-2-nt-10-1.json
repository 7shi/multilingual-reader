  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the conversational flow and explains complex concepts clearly. Sentence structures are generally straightforward, although a few lines feel slightly clunky (e.g., \"una IA totalmente nueva a la escuela\"). Overall, a Spanish‑speaking listener would understand the content with minimal effort.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural overall, but there are several awkward expressions and a few grammatical errors (missing accent on \"¿Porque\", the phrasing \"una IA totalmente nueva a la escuela\", and the placement of question marks). Vocabulary choices are appropriate, but some idiomatic choices could be smoother (e.g., \"cramming\" → \"aclaramiento rápido\").",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\". The translation of \"grounding\" as \"fundamentación\" is acceptable but could be closer to \"anclaje\". Term consistency is maintained throughout the dialogue.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation preserves the informal podcast tone and cultural references. Some expressions could be more idiomatic for a Spanish audience (e.g., \"a la escuela\" instead of \"en la escuela\"), but the overall intent and purpose are clearly conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines are present; no significant information is omitted. The translation also retains the explanatory tone of the original and keeps the structure concise and clear.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful and comprehensible, effectively conveying the original podcast content. Minor issues with naturalness, punctuation, and a few term choices prevent it from scoring higher, but it remains a solid translation suitable for the target audience. Enhancements in phrasing and consistency could raise the score further, especially in fluency and terminology accuracy. Overall, the translation is very good and requires only slight polishing to achieve near‑perfect fluency and precision."
