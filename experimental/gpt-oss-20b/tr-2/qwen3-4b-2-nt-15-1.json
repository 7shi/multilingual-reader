  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and easy to read. Sentences follow a logical order and complex ideas are broken down similarly to the original. Minor grammatical errors (e.g., missing accents, slight word order issues) do not impede understanding. Score: 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text mostly reads naturally for a Spanish speaker, but there are a few awkward phrases and inconsistent capitalization (e.g., \"la función de Memoria\"). The use of \"antiespia\" for \"antisèche\" is incorrect and sounds unnatural. Overall, the flow is good but with some noticeable errors. Score: 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly translated and consistently used. The only problematic term is \"antiespia\" for \"antisèche\"; a more accurate translation would be \"hoja de trucos\" or \"pizarra\". Score: 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal yet explanatory tone of the original podcast. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is straightforward. The overall intent and humor of the conversation are maintained. Minor issues with capitalization and word choice slightly reduce naturalness, but the core message is intact. Score: 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, anchoring, memory features, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. No substantial content is omitted. Minor omissions include the hyphen in \"pre‑entrenamiento\" and the incorrect translation of \"antisèche\", but these do not affect the overall meaning. Score: 19/20.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and conveys the main ideas of the original French text. It is largely accurate, with only a handful of minor linguistic and terminology errors that slightly affect fluency and naturalness. With a few corrections—especially replacing \"antiespia\" with a proper equivalent and standardizing capitalization—the translation would be excellent. Overall, the quality is high and suitable for a native Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts. The overall score is 90 out of 100 (4.5/5)."
