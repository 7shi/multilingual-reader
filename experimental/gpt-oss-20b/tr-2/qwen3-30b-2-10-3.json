    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the logical flow of the original dialogue and explains technical concepts in a clear manner. Phrases such as “la IA es como un recién graduado universitario” directly translate the metaphor and are easily understood. Minor awkwardness appears in a few literal renderings (“imaginen que enviamos…”) but overall the text is comprehensible for native speakers.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences read naturally; however, some expressions feel slightly formal or literal, e.g., “Ustedes pueden tomar un modelo…”. The use of the English word “prompt” is acceptable but could be adapted to “indicador” or “entrada”. Overall, the translation is smooth with only minor, non‑obtrusive stiffness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “anclaje (grounding)”, “memoria”. The choice of words matches common Spanish NLP terminology, and no key concept is lost or misnamed.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The cultural context of a podcast in Spanish is preserved, but some idiomatic expressions from French are translated too literally (e.g., “imaginen que enviamos…”). The conversational tone remains intact, yet the occasional use of formal second‑person plural (“Ustedes”) slightly detaches the natural Spanish spoken style.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All substantive parts of the original dialogue are present, including the distinctions between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, grounding, and memory features. No critical detail is omitted, and the added clarifications (e.g., explaining “prompt” and “ICL”) improve understanding rather than introduce redundancy.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, faithfully reproducing the content and tone of the French source. Minor linguistic stiffness and occasional literal phrasing slightly reduce the naturalness, but the technical accuracy and completeness are excellent. It would benefit from a more idiomatic adjustment in a few sentences to match everyday Spanish usage, but overall it serves its intended audience well as a podcast transcript or script. The translation achieves a strong balance between faithful representation and readability for Spanish‑speaking listeners, meriting a high overall rating with only small room for refinement in fluency and contextual nuance. The average score across criteria is 18.4/20, reflecting an overall excellent translation with room for minor polishing to reach perfection."
