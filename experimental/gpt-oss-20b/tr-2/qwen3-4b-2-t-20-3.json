  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is overall understandable. Sentence structures are largely correct, and the dialogue flow mirrors the original. Some sentences feel slightly stiff (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto es el estudio rápido”) but the meaning is clear. Overall, listeners would grasp the concepts without confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads fairly natural, yet a few expressions are slightly awkward for native Spanish speakers. Phrases such as “¿Entonces, es una artimaña?” or “El aprendizaje en contexto es el estudio rápido” could be smoothed out. Nonetheless, the overall flow is smooth and grammatical.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly translated: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"in‑context learning (ICL)\", \"grounding (anclaje)\", \"memoria a corto plazo\". Consistency is maintained throughout. Minor nuance in “El aprendizaje en contexto es el estudio rápido” could be refined, but terminology remains appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation keeps the podcast tone and uses culturally neutral Spanish. Minor adjustments (e.g., replacing French “éclair” with “Tech Éclair” unchanged) are fine. Some expressions could be more idiomatic, but the intent and humor are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory features, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. No significant content is omitted, and the summary sections remain concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid, preserving the original content, tone, and technical nuance. Minor fluency and style adjustments would elevate the naturalness for native Spanish speakers, but the current version is functional and largely faithful."
