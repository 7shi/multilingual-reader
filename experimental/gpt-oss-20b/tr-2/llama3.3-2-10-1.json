  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, with clear sentence structures and logical flow. However, occasional missing accents (e.g., \"está\" vs. \"esta\"), missing punctuation, and a few awkward phrasings (such as \"se le proporcionan\" instead of \"se le proporcionan\") slightly hinder readability. Overall, listeners can grasp the content, but some polishing would improve clarity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly smoothly, using appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic expressions. Nevertheless, there are some unnatural constructions and minor grammatical slips, such as the insertion of an editorial note and slightly awkward phrasing (“el sistema busca rápidamente…”). These issues reduce the naturalness slightly but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently and appropriately. The translator uses standard Spanish equivalents like \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino/afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", and keeps the English acronym ICL. Minor inconsistencies (e.g., sometimes using \"ajuste\" vs. \"afinamiento\") are present but do not cause confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent of the original is preserved. The translator adapts certain cultural references, such as changing the show title to \"Tecnoluz\" in one place, which shows an attempt at localization. Some phrases feel slightly unnatural in Spanish context, but the core meaning and humor remain intact.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French source are conveyed: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, anchoring, memory features, and the consultant vs. expert metaphor. Minor omissions are negligible, and redundancy is avoided. The translation covers the full dialogue without losing critical information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is overall solid and faithful to the original. It captures the main ideas and technical concepts well, with clear explanations and a logical flow. Minor issues—such as occasional missing accents, some unnatural phrasing, and a few editorial insertions—slightly detract from the polish. With a bit of refinement, the text would read as naturally and professionally as the source material. Overall, a competent and readable translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts and podcast content, though some linguistic polishing would bring it to an even higher level of fluency and accuracy. The translation shows good technical terminology handling and contextual adaptation, making it a strong candidate for publication or broadcast with minimal adjustments.\n\nOverall score: 17/20 (average of individual criteria)."
