    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to read and the conversational tone is preserved. Sentences are short and logically ordered, and complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a general audience can understand. Minor hiccups (e.g., “preentrenamiento” is in quotes, a few awkward word choices) do not significantly impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally for most native Spanish speakers, but several parts feel slightly stilted or carry a literal‑translation tone. Errors such as the gender mismatch in “ingenioso” (should be “ingeniosa”), the inconsistent use of “ajuste fino” vs “fine‑tuning”, and odd phrases like “Lo has comprendido todo!” reduce overall smoothness. Nevertheless, the majority of the dialogue sounds conversational and free of major grammatical problems.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: pre‑training → preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning → ajuste fino, in‑context learning → aprendizaje en contexto, grounding → anclaje, memory → memoria. The occasional mix‑up with “fine‑tuning” later in the text and the pluralization of “información” to “informaciones” slightly diminish consistency, but the core terminology remains appropriate and clear.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the cultural context of a Spanish‑speaking audience. Idiomatic equivalents (“Hola y bienvenidos”, “levantar el velo”) are used, and the overall intent of the original podcast script is preserved. The adaptation could improve some colloquial phrasing, but it successfully conveys the original meaning without unnecessary localization changes.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present in the Spanish version. The structure, dialogue turns, and explanations of training phases, transfer learning, and memory functions are all retained. Minor omissions are absent, and redundancies are minimal, though a few small details (like the exact phrasing of “fine‑tuning” consistency) are overlooked. Overall, the content is complete and accurate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is strong overall, capturing the technical content and conversational tone of the original podcast. Minor grammatical slips and inconsistent terminology usage slightly reduce fluency, but the piece remains readable, accurate, and contextually appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. A few edits (correct gender agreement, consistent term usage, and smoother phrasing) would bring the text to an almost perfect level of polish."
