  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and logical. Sentences are structured in a way that most Spanish‑speaking listeners can follow without confusion. Some minor awkward phrasing (e.g., *Lo has entendido todo.*) slightly hampers smoothness, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads quite naturally for native speakers. Most terminology and idiomatic expressions are appropriate. However, there are a few minor grammatical slips (e.g., missing accent in *¿Porque*). Overall, the text is fluent but not perfectly polished.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto* and *ICL* are correctly translated and consistently used. The choice of *fundamentación* for *grounding* is understandable but could be more precise. Nonetheless, the terminology is suitable for a general audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The speaker names and introductory remarks are culturally adapted (e.g., *Hola y bienvenidos*). The translation respects the original tone and keeps the conversational style. Minor cultural mismatches appear: *¿Porque* lacks an accent, and *una hoja de resumen* might not fully capture the nuance of *antisèche*. Overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French transcript is preserved. The Spanish version does not omit any key ideas, and it retains the humor and illustrative examples. There is no unnecessary repetition, and the content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and faithful to the source material. It is readable and mostly fluent, with appropriate terminology and no loss of information. A few minor editorial fixes (accent marks, slight wording tweaks) would bring it to near‑perfect quality. It is suitable for a general Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts and podcast content. A moderate level of polish is recommended for professional publication, but as a conversational translation it works well enough for casual listening or quick reading."
