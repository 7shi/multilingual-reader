  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text follows the original structure and logical flow. Sentences are generally short and clear, making it easy for native readers to understand the concepts. Minor grammatical slip‑ups such as *ha sido borrada* (should be *borrado*) and *una conocimiento* (should be *un conocimiento*) slightly interrupt the flow but do not hinder comprehension. Overall readability is high, though a few sentences could be simplified for maximum clarity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly in most parts, but several awkward phrasings and grammatical inconsistencies reduce naturalness. Examples include *la IA no se afinaría* (should be *la IA no se afina*), *tus discusiones* (better *tus conversaciones*), and *El propio modelo no aprende ni evoluciona con tus discusiones*. These issues make the text feel less polished. Nevertheless, the vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto* (ICL). The occasional inconsistent abbreviation (*AIL* vs *ICL*) and the mis‑translation of *grounding* as *anclaje* (correct) suggest minor editorial oversight. Terminology remains understandable and consistent across most of the transcript.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and tone, using culturally appropriate greetings and analogies. No significant cultural dissonance appears, and the Spanish version feels tailored to a Spanish‑speaking audience. The adaptation is effective and slightly improves readability where needed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French transcript are present. No major content is omitted, and the explanations are faithful. Small omissions such as the nuance of *un conocimiento* vs *una conocimiento* are trivial. The translation maintains the balance between completeness and conciseness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is a solid rendition that accurately conveys the technical concepts and overall narrative of the original French podcast. While it exhibits minor grammatical and terminological inconsistencies, the core meaning remains intact and the text is generally understandable and engaging for a Spanish‑speaking audience. With some proofreading to correct a few syntax errors and to standardize abbreviations, the translation would reach an excellent level of quality."
