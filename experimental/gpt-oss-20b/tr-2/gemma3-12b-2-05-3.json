  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely comprehensible; sentences follow a logical flow and key concepts are explained clearly. Some minor structural quirks (e.g., repetition of *la IA se va a la escuela*) slightly interrupt the reading rhythm, but overall a native reader can grasp the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most of the translation reads smoothly, there are a few unnatural phrasings such as *la IA se va a la escuela* (a literal but awkward rendering of *on sends an IA to school*) and the double use of *se va*. These create a slightly stilted tone. The rest of the text feels natural and colloquial.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: *pre-entrenamiento* → *entrenamiento inicial*, *fine‑tuning* → *ajuste fino*, *in‑context learning* → *aprendizaje en contexto*, and *grounding* → *conexión a la realidad* (the latter could be refined but remains understandable). Term consistency is good and explanations are provided where needed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the French idioms to Spanish equivalents (e.g., *consultor brillante*, *ventana de contexto*), preserving the conversational tone suitable for a podcast. Cultural nuances are largely respected, though some expressions feel a bit too literal. Overall intent and purpose are conveyed effectively.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original script is present. No significant content is omitted, and the translation adds no extraneous details. Minor omissions are negligible, and the text remains concise while clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and largely faithful to the source text. It retains the conversational style and explains key concepts, though a few literal phrasings slightly impede fluency. Technical terminology is handled correctly, and the overall message is preserved. A small editorial pass focusing on the most awkward verb phrases would elevate the translation to a near‑perfect level, but as it stands it serves its purpose well for a Spanish‑speaking audience listening to a tech podcast discussion about AI training methods and context learning features. Overall quality is solid with room for minor stylistic refinement. The average score reflects strong readability, decent fluency, good terminology usage, adequate contextual adaptation, and complete information coverage. A slight improvement in natural phrasing could push it into the higher tier of translations for professional use. Overall, the translation is well executed and ready for broadcast with minor tweaks for polish. Overall Score: 17/20."
