  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely coherent and follows the logical flow of the original French script. Sentences are mostly short and the key ideas are expressed clearly. Some long paragraphs could be split for better scanning, but overall a native reader would grasp the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation feels mostly natural, but a few expressions stand out as literal or slightly awkward. Phrases such as \"revelar\" for \"revelar\" are fine, yet \"reentrenar\" is less common in Spanish technical discourse. The comparison \"El aprendizaje en contexto es como memorizar para un examen\" sounds a bit forced; a native speaker might prefer \"similar a memorizar para un examen\". Despite these minor issues, the text reads smoothly overall.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled largely correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"grounding\" translated as \"anclaje a la realidad\". However, the use of both Spanish and English within single sentences (e.g., \"aprendizaje en contexto (o ICL, por sus siglas en inglés)\") could be streamlined. Also, \"reentrenar\" is not the most idiomatic term for fine‑tuning. Overall, terminology is consistent but could be polished.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the podcast’s informal tone and the French brand name. Cultural references are appropriate and no awkward or inappropriate expressions appear. The adaptation of idioms (e.g., \"consultor brillante\") is suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience. Minor improvements could involve adjusting the metaphor of a consultant to a more familiar phrase, but overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the translation retains the script’s structure and dialogue. The inclusion of explanations for technical terms (e.g., describing transfer learning) is adequate. The text is concise without unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation delivers a clear, largely faithful rendering of the original French script. While a few expressions feel slightly literal and could be smoothed out, the overall readability, terminology, and contextual adaptation are strong. Minor linguistic polish would elevate the fluency to a near‑native level, but the current version already serves its purpose well for a Spanish‑speaking audience of a tech podcast. The translation is competent and conveys the intended information accurately, making it suitable for its target readers."
