  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text follows the original structure and uses clear sentences. Technical concepts are explained in a way that is easy for general readers to grasp, with analogies that translate well. Some sentences are long and could be broken up for even better flow, but overall the message is comprehensible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a Spanish speaker. There are a few slightly awkward constructions (e.g., \"la memoria de la IA es temporal. Si quiero que recuerde las mismas informaciones al día siguiente…\") and some verbosity in explanations. Vocabulary choices are mostly contemporary and appropriate, but a few phrases could be smoothed out for greater elegance.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: \"ajuste fino\" for fine‑tuning, \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", and the use of acronyms (ICL) are all accurate. Explanations accompany terms where needed, aiding reader comprehension.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal, conversational tone of the original podcast script. Cultural references are adapted suitably, and the Spanish equivalent expressions maintain the intent. Minor improvements could be made in idiomatic phrasing, but the overall contextual adaptation is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, context windows, grounding, memory versus short‑term context, and the analogy with consultants. No essential information is omitted, and unnecessary repetition is avoided.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the original content while maintaining a natural, conversational style. Minor fluency tweaks and slight re‑phrasing could enhance readability, but overall it is a well‑executed translation suitable for a general audience. The translator has successfully managed technical terminology, contextual adaptation, and information completeness, resulting in a clear and engaging final text. The translation would be well-received by native Spanish speakers familiar with AI terminology, and it effectively supports the podcast's educational goals without loss of nuance or clarity. Overall score: 87/100 (average 17.4/20)."
