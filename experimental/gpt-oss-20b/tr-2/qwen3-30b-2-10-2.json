  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish dialogue follows the original structure closely, uses clear explanations for concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning, and maintains a logical sentence flow. Only a few sentences are marginally longer or contain a slightly awkward turn of phrase, but overall readers can understand the content easily.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The use of parenthetical English terms (e.g., ‘fine‑tuning’) is acceptable, but some sentences are a bit wordy or could be tightened. Overall, the translation sounds smooth and appropriate for native speakers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are rendered accurately: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, ventana de contexto, memoria. The terminology is consistent throughout and matches common Spanish usage in AI discourse.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Cultural adaptation is good: the opening greeting is translated naturally, and the conversational tone is preserved. The translation does not add or remove cultural references that would alter the intent. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “consultor brillante”) fit Spanish conventions.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All lines of the original script are present, and no essential information is omitted. The translation provides necessary context for each speaker’s remarks, keeping the dialogue concise yet complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is highly faithful to the French original, preserving meaning, structure, and technical content. It reads clearly and fluently for native speakers, with only a few minor stylistic quirks. The terminology is accurate and consistent, and the overall message and intent are fully conveyed. Minor adjustments could improve word choice in a few sentences, but the translation is already of high quality and ready for use."
