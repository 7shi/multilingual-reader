  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and logically organized. Sentences follow the same order as the French original, making it easy for a Spanish‑speaking audience to follow the flow of ideas. Some clauses are long but remain comprehensible, and key concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained without unnecessary jargon.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall, the translation reads smoothly. Minor issues arise from occasional formal‑informal switches (e.g., \"Usted ha entendido todo\" vs. the otherwise informal \"tú\" usage). Phrases like \"una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\" are understandable but slightly clunky. Nevertheless, the text sounds natural to native speakers in most places.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\", \"anclaje\". Consistency is maintained throughout, and no crucial term is omitted or mistranslated.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation takes into account Spanish idiomatic expressions and cultural expectations. The message’s intent—explaining AI learning phases—is preserved, and no culturally inappropriate references appear. Minor literalisms remain but do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All substantive points from the original are present: the process of pre‑training, transfer learning, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the analogy of a consultant vs. permanent expert. The translation does not omit any critical information, and redundancies are largely avoided.",
      "score": 19
    },
