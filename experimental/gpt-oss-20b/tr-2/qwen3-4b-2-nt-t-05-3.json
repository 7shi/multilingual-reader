    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable; the dialogue follows the original structure and the main ideas are clear. However, some sentences feel stilted or overly literal (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotage”), and the frequent switch to the formal pronoun “Usted” disrupts the conversational tone. Overall, readers can follow the content but would benefit from smoother phrasing.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural constructions and awkward word choices (“Usted ha entendido todo”, “se le ha dado una información en tiempo real”). These affect the natural flow for a native speaker. The style is somewhat formal compared to the original informal tone. Nevertheless, the grammar is correct and the message is conveyed.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *grounding*, and *In‑Context Learning* are correctly rendered. The choice of *anclaje* for grounding is appropriate. Minor issues include the literal use of “bachotage” and the phrase “del bachotage” which could be better expressed as “memorización superficial” or “aprendizaje por ensayo”. Overall terminology handling is good.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation stays true to the original intent but fails to match the informal register; the use of “Usted” instead of “tú” creates a formal distance that is not present in the source. Cultural references are largely preserved, but some idiomatic nuances (e.g., “como un consultor brillante”) could be refined. Adaptation is acceptable but could be improved for a more natural Spanish audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All original information is present; no major omissions or additions. The dialogue covers pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. Redundancies are minimal and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation effectively conveys the essential ideas and terminology of the original French script, but its readability and naturalness suffer from literal phrasing and an inappropriate formal register. A more fluid, idiomatic Spanish style and consistent use of informal pronouns would raise the quality substantially. The technical accuracy and completeness are strengths, yet the overall presentation feels somewhat stiff and could be refined to match the conversational tone of the source."
