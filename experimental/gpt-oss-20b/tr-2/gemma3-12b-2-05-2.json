  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation follows the original storyline and dialogue structure fairly closely, making it generally easy to read. Most sentences are straightforward, but a few lines become slightly cumbersome because of literal phrasing (e.g., *\"se le ha proporcionado una antisèche\"*). Additionally, the use of the pronoun *usted* or *tú* is inconsistent, which can momentarily disrupt the flow for a casual listener. Overall, readers can understand the content, though a few clarifications would improve comprehension of technical concepts.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely fluent for a native Spanish speaker. However, there are several idiomatic errors and awkward expressions: *\"una antisèche\"* (a French term rarely used in Spanish), *\"se le ha proporcionado una antisèche justo antes de que empezara a hablar contigo\"* is clunky, and *\"se le ha proporcionado una antisèche justo antes de que empezara a hablar contigo\"* repeats the verb phrase unnecessarily. Word choices like *\"consultor brillante\"* and *\"consultor temporal\"* could be simplified to *\"consultor\"* or *\"asesor\"* to sound more natural. Minor grammatical issues (e.g., gender agreement in *\"se le ha proporcionado una antisèche\"* – *antisèche* is feminine) also detract slightly from fluency.",

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered: *\"pre-entrenamiento\"*, *\"ajuste fino\"*, *\"aprendizaje por transferencia\"*, *\"ventana de contexto\"*, *\"In-Context Learning (ICL)\"* are all appropriate and understandable. Nevertheless, *\"fine-tuning\"* was rendered as *\"ajuste fino\"*, which is acceptable but not as widely used as *\"ajuste fino\"*; *\"grounding\"* was translated as *\"conexión a la realidad\"*, which loses nuance – *\"anclaje\"* or *\"enraizamiento\"* might be better. The explanation of *\"contextual adaptation\"* was omitted, making some terms slightly vague. Consistency overall is good, though occasional literal translations (e.g., *\"antisèche\"*) detract from clarity.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to adapt cultural references (e.g., referring to *\"consultor brillante\"*). However, the literal use of *\"antisèche\"* (French for cheat sheet) and the phrase *\"una antisèche\"* is not naturally understood by Spanish readers. Also, the gender shift from *\"le\"* to *\"la\"* in *\"una antisèche\"* may cause confusion. The dialogue remains faithful to the original intent and tone, but a few localized expressions could be improved for better cultural resonance.",

    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the essential points from the original French text are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the new memory feature. The translation does not omit any major concept. Some redundant phrases appear (e.g., *\"se le ha proporcionado una antisèche justo antes de que empezara a hablar contigo\"* is repeated with no additional value). The overall content remains concise, though slight repetition may be removed for clarity.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is mostly accurate and understandable, but it contains several stylistic and lexical imperfections that affect its naturalness and clarity. The main issues are the literal use of *antisèche*, occasional gender inconsistencies, and a few awkward sentence structures. With minor revisions to improve idiomatic expression and consistency, the translation could be considered of high quality for native Spanish speakers. It preserves the original meaning and context, but the fluency could be elevated with smoother phrasing and more culturally appropriate terminology."
