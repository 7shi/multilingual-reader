  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. The dialogue format is preserved, and most sentences are logically structured. However, some sentences lack articles or have slightly awkward phrasing (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenido en …\", \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es del cramming\"). These minor issues mildly affect readability but do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Yet there are a few unnatural expressions: \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es del cramming\" (should be \"es un cramming\"), \"Se tiene la impresión de que la IA realmente comienzan a recordar\" (missing subject agreement). Some verb forms and prepositions are slightly off, but overall the text reads smoothly.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"In-Context Learning (ICL)\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". Consistency is maintained, and explanations are adequate for a general audience. Minor improvement could be adding parentheses for the acronym ICL earlier.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the informal, conversational tone of the original podcast. Cultural references are appropriate, and expressions like \"contratar un consultor destacado\" fit the context. Small stylistic tweaks (e.g., \"en el podcast\" instead of just \"en\") would enhance naturalness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines from the original are present, and no substantive information is omitted. Minor omissions (e.g., missing article in the greeting) do not alter meaning. The translation is concise and avoids unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the gist of the original French text with good technical accuracy and overall readability. While there are a handful of awkward phrasings and minor grammatical slips, the content remains understandable and faithful to the source. A quick proofread focusing on article usage and verb agreement would bring the text to a more polished, native‑level quality."
