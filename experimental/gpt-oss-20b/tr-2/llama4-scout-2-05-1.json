  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable, but there are a few minor errors that could confuse readers. For example, the mix‑up between *entrenamiento previo* and the misspelled *pre‑entrainamiento* introduces inconsistency, and some sentences are overly literal, making the flow a bit clunky. Nonetheless, the overall structure follows the original’s logical progression and complex ideas are explained in a way that most native speakers can follow.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the translation reads reasonably well, several phrases feel unnatural or grammatically awkward. The use of *pre‑entrainamiento* instead of *pre‑entrenamiento*, the phrasing *la IA no se perfecciona constantemente por tus conversaciones*, and the abrupt switch to *Entiendes todo* all reduce the smoothness. Vocabulary choices are largely correct, but the overall flow could benefit from more idiomatic Spanish.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled appropriately. *Fine‑tuning* becomes *afinamiento*, *pre‑training* is translated as *entrenamiento previo*, and *In‑Context Learning* is rendered as *aprendizaje en contexto* with a helpful note. However, the misspelling *pre‑entrainamiento* is a slip, and the term *grounding* could be better rendered as *anclaje* or *fundamentación*. Overall consistency is good, but a few minor corrections would improve precision.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and cultural references well. Phrases like \"consultor brillante\" and the analogies about education and bicycle riding resonate with Spanish‑speaking audiences. Some cultural nuances (e.g., the casual tone of the original French podcast) are retained, but a few sentences feel slightly formal or literal, which slightly reduces the natural adaptation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all content from the original is present. Minor omissions are unlikely; the only noticeable issue is the inconsistent use of *pre‑entrainamiento*, which could lead to confusion but does not drop any substantive information. The translator added a helpful clarification about ICL, which slightly expands on the original but does not distort meaning. Overall, completeness is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and comprehensible but could benefit from a few linguistic refinements. The core concepts are well preserved, terminology is largely accurate, and the adaptation suits a Spanish‑speaking audience. Attention to consistency (especially with technical terms) and smoother phrasing would elevate the text to a more polished level. The overall score reflects a good translation with room for minor improvements in fluency and terminology precision."
