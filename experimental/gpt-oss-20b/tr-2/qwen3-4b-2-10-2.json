  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version largely follows the original dialogue structure and uses simple sentences, making the content generally easy to read. However, there are occasional grammatical errors (e.g., *« una cantidad masiva de datos en la internet »*, *« le dábamos solo un precalentamiento »*) and some unnatural phrasing (e.g., *« la IA es como un recién graduado de la universidad »*). These minor issues slightly hinder smooth comprehension but do not prevent understanding.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly fluent, but several sentences feel unnatural or contain awkward wording, such as *« Usted ha entendido todo »* instead of *« has entendido todo »*, and the inconsistent use of *« una IA »* versus *« la IA »*. There are also punctuation mistakes and a few instances where the word order does not match typical Spanish syntax. Overall, the text is understandable but would benefit from a polishing pass to enhance naturalness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally handled correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *ventana de contexto*, *grounding* translated as *anclaje*. Consistency is good, and explanations are provided when necessary. The only minor slip is the untranslated term *prompt* (kept in English) which is acceptable in the context. Terminology is therefore strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original to Spanish-speaking audiences by using appropriate idiomatic expressions and avoiding overly literal phrasing. Cultural references are preserved, and the tone matches a conversational podcast. However, some localized adjustments could improve clarity, such as replacing *« una IA »* with *« una inteligencia artificial »* for readability. Overall, contextual adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French script are present in the Spanish version: the stages of training, transfer learning, in-context learning, memory mechanisms, and the consultant versus expert analogy. No essential content is omitted, and the dialogue follows the same sequence. Minor redundancy exists but is acceptable for a conversational format. The translation maintains the information balance.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core ideas and structure of the original French podcast script, making it largely understandable for Spanish-speaking listeners. However, the fluency is somewhat marred by grammatical inaccuracies and awkward phrasing. Addressing these issues would bring the translation closer to a native‑speaker standard while preserving its technical accuracy and contextual relevance. With a few refinements, this translation would be suitable for publication or broadcast in Spanish-speaking markets.\n\nTotal score: 82/120 (68%) – solid but improvable in fluency and polish.\n\n"
