  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable; sentences follow a clear logic and complex concepts are generally well explained. Minor issues arise from occasional literal phrasing (“el sistema busca rápidamente entre los intercambios anteriores las informaciones …”) and slight inconsistencies in tense and pronoun usage, but overall readers can follow the content without major confusion.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads mostly smoothly, but several awkward or unnatural expressions appear: “en ocultas” instead of “en ocultas” (should be “en ocultas” or “en las sombras”), “informaciones” (better singular “información”), and some literal word‑for‑word stretches such as “Cuando usted abre una nueva conversación” which feels clunky. These reduce the overall naturalness, though the vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms are generally translated correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, memoria. However, the Spanish equivalent of \"grounding\" is not used; the French word \"ancrage\" is retained with an English translation in brackets, which is inconsistent and may confuse readers. Term consistency is otherwise acceptable.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation captures the casual, conversational tone of the podcast and respects Spanish idiomatic expressions (“consultor brillante”, “se abre una nueva ventana”). Some literal translations persist (e.g., “intercambios anteriores”), and cultural nuance could be tightened, but the overall intent and purpose of the original are preserved.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are present in the Spanish version. No substantive omissions or distortions occur, and the translation keeps the content concise and clear. The explanation of memory functions is adequately preserved, though a brief clarification of the grounding term could improve completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is broadly faithful and comprehensible, with good coverage of technical concepts. Fluency suffers from a few awkward phrasings, and terminology could be improved by fully adopting Spanish equivalents (especially for \"grounding\"). The adaptation respects the original’s tone, and no critical information is omitted. With minor refinements, this translation would reach a high level of quality for a native Spanish-speaking audience, especially those with a technical background or podcast listeners. Overall, it is solid but could benefit from smoothing language and standardizing terminology to achieve a more natural and professional finish. The overall score reflects an average performance across criteria, with room for improvement in terminology and fluency to reach an excellent standard."
