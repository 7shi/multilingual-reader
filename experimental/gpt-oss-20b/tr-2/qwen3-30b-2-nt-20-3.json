  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish dialogue is largely understandable and follows a logical structure. However, a line is missing where Camille asks about fine‑tuning, which creates a small gap in the flow. Some sentences are a bit verbose, but overall the target audience can follow the discussion without much difficulty.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation sounds natural for a Spanish‑speaking listener. A few phrases feel slightly literal or awkward – e.g., \"solo se le ha proporcionado un resumen justo antes de que comience a hablarle\" and \"Se puede decir eso\" – but these do not impede comprehension. Overall, the text reads smoothly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje. The translation stays consistent throughout and explains concepts in a way suitable for a general audience. Minor variations (e.g., \"ventana de contexto\" vs. \"contexto\") are acceptable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue keeps the original conversational tone and adapts idioms appropriately. Cultural references are minimal, but the translation uses Spanish phrasing (e.g., \"consultor brillante\") that feels natural. The missing line, however, slightly weakens the contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The major omission is Camille’s question after \"L'affinage...\"; that line is missing entirely. Aside from that, most of the content is present, though some short explanations are abbreviated. The overall message is preserved but with a slight loss of detail.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation delivers the core ideas and technical concepts accurately and reads well for a native audience. The main shortcoming is the missing line where Camille asks about fine‑tuning, which creates a small information gap. Fluency and terminology are strong, while readability and completeness suffer a little due to the omitted content. Overall, it is a solid translation with minor areas for improvement, especially regarding completeness and smoothness in a few phrases."
