    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the overall structure of the dialogue, making it mostly easy to follow. Some sentences, however, are slightly wordy or awkwardly punctuated (e.g., “Y en lugar de reentrenar la IA para hacerla una especialista, se le da simplemente la información que necesita para la tarea que debe completar.”). Complex concepts are largely preserved, but the flow could be smoother. Overall score: 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most vocabulary is appropriate, there are several instances of unnatural phrasing and inconsistent use of formal vs informal pronouns (e.g., “si quieres que la IA tenga conocimiento” vs. “si desea que la IA tenga conocimiento”). The translation occasionally repeats the same phrase (“Aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en contexto)”) which disrupts naturalness. The overall feel is close to native but still noticeably literal. Overall score: 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto* and *aprendizaje en contexto* are correctly rendered. There is consistency in term usage and the translation does not introduce confusing synonyms. Minor issues: “Memoria” is capitalized in a non‑typical way, and “I.C.L.” is spelled out but not consistently. Overall score: 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue retains its casual, conversational tone, but some cultural nuances are missed: the original uses formal address (“usted”) while the translation mixes informal pronouns. The phrase “en la ventana de conversación” feels less natural than “en la nueva ventana de chat.” Also, idiomatic expressions like “se le da simplemente la información que necesita” could be smoother (“se le proporciona la información necesaria”). Overall, the intent is preserved but the localization could be tightened. Overall score: 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory mechanisms, and the consultant analogy. No substantive information is omitted, and the translation includes necessary clarifications. Redundancy is minimal, though some repetitive explanations appear. Overall score: 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is fairly accurate and captures most of the technical content and conversational flow of the original French script. It demonstrates good terminology usage and conveys the key concepts. However, it suffers from occasional literalness, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent use of formal pronouns. With some polishing—especially around natural phrasing and consistent address style—the translation would achieve a higher level of fluency and readability for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Overall, it is solid but not yet flawless, scoring around 15 out of 20 for the overall quality when considering all criteria together. 15/20 is a reasonable aggregate estimate, reflecting strengths in terminology and completeness, but weaknesses in fluency and contextual adaptation that lower the overall score slightly above mid‑range quality. 15/20."
