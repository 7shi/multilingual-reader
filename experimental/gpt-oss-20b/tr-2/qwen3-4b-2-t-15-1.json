  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely preserves the original structure, but several sentences are awkwardly phrased or contain literal word‑by‑word errors (e.g., “Usted ha entendido todo”, “El aprendizaje en contexto, es aplastar en la víspera”). These fragments make it harder for a native Spanish speaker to follow the flow. The overall idea is understandable, yet a few confusing expressions reduce readability.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains multiple grammatical slips and unnatural verb forms (e.g., “la IA no se afinada”, “Usted ha entendido todo”). Some lexical choices are correct, but others feel stilted or out of place, which detracts from a smooth, natural reading experience. Overall, the translation reads like a machine‑generated text rather than a polished human‑written one.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly – \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" (anclaje), \"prompt\", \"memoria\" – and the terms are consistently used throughout. The translation does not explain every term, but it keeps the jargon appropriate for an audience familiar with AI concepts. Minor inconsistencies arise from literal mistranslations, but overall terminology is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version respects the cultural context and keeps the informal, conversational tone of the original podcast. However, some expressions (e.g., “aplastar en la víspera”) feel literal and lack natural Spanish idioms. The overall intent is preserved, but a few phrases could be better adapted to everyday Spanish usage.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation includes all the main ideas and dialogue from the French source. No substantive content was omitted, and the length is comparable. Some explanatory paraphrases present in the French version (e.g., the analogy with a bicycle) are retained, ensuring the listener can grasp the concepts. No unnecessary repetitions were added.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the essential information and maintains most of the original terminology, but its readability and fluency suffer from several literal translations and grammatical errors. With a few natural‑language adjustments, the text would become clear and engaging for Spanish‑speaking listeners. As it stands, it is a competent but slightly rough rendition suitable for readers with some AI background but not ideal for a polished, broadcast‑ready version. The information conveyed is largely complete, but the translation would benefit from a native‑speaker review to smooth out awkward phrasing and correct minor inaccuracies."
