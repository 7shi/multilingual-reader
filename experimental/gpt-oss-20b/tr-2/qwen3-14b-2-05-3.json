  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and follows a logical sentence structure. The dialogue format is preserved, and the flow of ideas from pre‑training to fine‑tuning to ICL is clear. Some sentences, however, feel slightly clunky (e.g., \"La IA no está constantemente mejorada por sus conversaciones\") and could be smoothed. Overall, readers with a moderate level of Spanish can comprehend the content without major confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the text reads naturally for a native Spanish speaker, but there are a few unnatural expressions: \"automatizado en contexto\" (should be \"automatizado en contexto\" is okay but feels forced), \"es una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje automatizado en contexto\" sounds redundant, and the phrase \"la IA no está constantemente mejorada por sus conversaciones\" is awkward. Vocabulary choices are mostly appropriate, but consistency of capitalization and terminology (e.g., \"Fine‑tuning\" vs \"finetuning\") could be improved. The overall fluency is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely retained: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" (translated as \"anclaje\"), \"memoria a corto plazo\", \"ventana de contexto\". However, inconsistencies appear: \"fine‑tuning\" is written as \"fine‑tuning\" and \"finetuning\" in different places, and \"In‑Context Learning\" is rendered as \"aprendizaje en contexto\" instead of keeping the English abbreviation. Some terms could benefit from brief explanations (e.g., ICL). Overall, terminology is correct but could be more consistent and explanatory.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references appropriately: \"cajas negras\" for black boxes, \"recientemente graduado\" for a fresh graduate, and the consultant analogy is preserved. The tone remains informal and conversational, matching the podcast style. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., \"recientemente graduado\" vs. \"recién graduado\") are inconsequential. Overall, the adaptation effectively conveys the original intent to Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation includes all major points from the original French script. Minor issues: a typographical error in \"La diferencia entre la crammar para un examen\" (should be \"gramática\"), and a slight omission of the phrase \"In‑Context Learning\" (ICL) when first introduced. These do not drastically alter meaning but slightly reduce clarity. No major content was omitted, and redundancy is largely avoided.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and conveys the essential content and tone of the original French script. It preserves the dialogue structure and the key technical concepts, making it understandable for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Some sentences could be polished for smoother flow, and consistency in terminology would strengthen the text. Overall, it is a solid translation that would serve well in a podcast context with minor refinements needed for perfect naturalness and consistency."
