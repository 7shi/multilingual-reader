  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally easy to follow, keeping the dialogue format and the main ideas intact. Sentences are clear and logical, and complex concepts such as pre‑training and fine‑tuning are explained without excessive jargon. Minor issues arise in a few places where clause structure feels a bit literal (e.g., “Los conocimientos que ustedes proporcionan…”) but overall readers can grasp the content quickly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text mostly reads naturally for a Spanish speaker, with correct grammar and appropriate vocabulary. However, some phrases feel slightly stiff or are literal translations that could be smoothed (“Ustedes han comprendido todo”, “La IA no está constantemente ajustada por sus conversaciones”). There are also a few minor typographical quirks (e.g., missing accent on “ajuste”). These do not hinder comprehension but affect the overall flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “grounding” as “anclaje”. The translations are accurate, consistent, and appropriate for a non‑technical audience. Some compound terms like “in‑context learning” are consistently rendered as “aprendizaje en contexto” throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue’s conversational tone is preserved, and the cultural references are adapted appropriately (e.g., switching to a more conversational Spanish style). The translation respects the original’s intent to educate and inform. Slight room for improvement exists in smoothing idiomatic expressions for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but the overall contextual adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French source is present: the explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the memory feature. No substantive content is omitted, and the narrative flow remains intact. Redundancies are minimal, and the translation remains concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is strong overall, maintaining clarity, accurate terminology, and faithful content while staying relatively natural in Spanish. A few phrasing adjustments would bring the fluency closer to native‑level smoothness, but the piece is functional and understandable for the intended audience."
