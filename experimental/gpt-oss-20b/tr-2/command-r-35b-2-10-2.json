    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the logical flow of the original. Sentences are mostly clear, though some are a bit long and could be broken up for easier reading. Minor awkwardness arises from literal translations of dialogue turns (e.g., \"El proceso de 'preentrenamiento'\" instead of the shorter \"El preentrenamiento\"). Overall, readers can grasp the main ideas without confusion.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation feels fairly natural to a Spanish‑speaking audience, but several phrases sound slightly stilted or overly literal: \"El proceso de 'preentrenamiento'\" and the repetition of \"El preentrenamiento\". Word choice is mostly appropriate, yet occasional awkwardness like \"Es una astucia\" versus the original \"Es un truco\" indicates a lack of idiomatic polish. Grammatical structures are correct, but the rhythm of some sentences could be smoother.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", and \"ventana contextual\" are consistent and clear. The translation maintains the same meaning across the text and uses Spanish equivalents that are widely understood in the AI community. No major terminology errors or omissions are present.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the intent and rhetorical style of the original, adapting cultural references appropriately (e.g., using \"consultor brillante\" instead of a literal term). However, some localized idioms could be improved for a native audience. The overall context is faithfully represented, with all key points and jokes retained.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential content from the original French script is present: pretraining, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory, and the final discussion about temporary versus permanent knowledge. No critical information is omitted, and the translation does not add extraneous content. Some small stylistic differences exist but do not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and mostly faithful to the source text. It conveys the technical concepts accurately and keeps the conversational tone. Minor improvements could be made in fluency and natural phrasing to enhance readability for native speakers, but the overall quality is solid and suitable for the intended audience. The translation demonstrates good command of terminology and context, making it effective for both technical and general listeners. Overall, a strong translation with room for slight polishing to achieve a more natural flow and tighter style. The average score reflects a solid performance with minor refinements needed for top‑tier polish. The final score is 15 out of 20, indicating a good but not perfect translation. The reasoning is reflected in the individual criterion scores and comments above. Overall, the translation is clear, accurate, and adequately adapted to the Spanish‑speaking audience, making it functional and comprehensible for the target listeners of the podcast. The strengths lie in terminology consistency and content completeness, while the main areas for improvement are in fluency and naturalness, particularly with sentence structure and idiomatic expressions. The translator successfully captured the original’s intent and tone, providing a translation that works well for the target audience. The overall evaluation suggests the translation is usable as is but could benefit from a second review focused on stylistic smoothing for a professional broadcast. Score: 15/20. "
