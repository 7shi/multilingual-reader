    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable for a native audience. Sentence structures are generally clear and the flow follows the original dialogue. However, some long sentences are a bit heavy (e.g., the paragraph explaining ICL and grounding), and a few phrases are slightly confusing (“La IA no aprende ni se desarrolla a partir de sus conversaciones”). Overall, the content can be followed but could benefit from minor simplification.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly fluent, but several expressions feel awkward or non‑native. Phrases such as “Lenguaje de Modelado de Contexto Grande” and “el propio modelo no aprende ni se desarrolla a partir de sus conversaciones” sound clunky. The choice of vocabulary is generally appropriate, yet a few wordings (“tiene la misma información” instead of “la misma información”) could be more natural. The text is understandable but would read more smoothly with some revisions.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are translated correctly (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento → refinamiento, ICL → aprendizaje en contexto, grounding → anclaje). The term “IA” is consistently used. However, the phrase “Lenguaje de Modelado de Contexto Grande” is unconventional; a native speaker would use “modelo de lenguaje grande”. Also, “afinado” is replaced by “refinamiento”, which is acceptable but not as common. Consistency is good, but precision could be improved.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the core intent of the original and uses culturally neutral language. It preserves the podcast’s informal tone and the dialogue format. Minor adaptations (e.g., explaining grounding in simpler terms) are made, but some cultural nuances (e.g., the “consultant” metaphor) are kept unchanged, which is fine. The text does not feel out of place for Spanish speakers. Overall, contextual adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version covers all the main points from the French source: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. No essential detail is omitted, and the explanation of temporary vs. permanent knowledge is preserved. Minor omissions or slight rephrasings do not alter the overall meaning. Thus, information completeness is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully conveys the original dialogue’s content and intent, but it shows a few stylistic and terminological slips that affect fluency and precision. The text is readable and contains all essential information, yet certain expressions feel unnatural and some terminology could be refined for a native audience. Overall, the translation is good but would benefit from a final polish to improve naturalness and technical accuracy. The overall quality is solid but not perfect, reflecting a 15/20 score across the criteria with an overall average of about 15/20. The strengths lie in completeness and contextual fidelity, while the weaknesses are mainly in fluency and some terminology choices."
