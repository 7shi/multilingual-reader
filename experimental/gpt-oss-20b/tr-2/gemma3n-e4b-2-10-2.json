  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the overall structure mirrors the original French script. Some sentences contain awkward phrasing (e.g., “informaciones” instead of “información” or “Lo has entendido todo” instead of “Has entendido todo”), but these do not severely impede comprehension. The dialogue remains coherent and the concept of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning is conveyed with clarity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but a few instances of unnatural wording or punctuation (e.g., the double exclamation marks, the phrase “¡Bonjour y bienvenida” which mixes French and Spanish, “¿Es una estrategia?” for “c’est une astuce”) detract from full fluency. Grammar is mostly correct but occasionally clunky. Overall, it reads smoothly but could be polished.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled accurately: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", and \"memoria a corto plazo\" are all appropriate and consistent. Some terminology is translated rather than retained (e.g., \"fine‑tuning\" as \"ajuste fino\"), which is acceptable. Minor inconsistencies in translation of \"grounding\" (anclaje) are still understandable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast introduction and dialogue. Cultural adaptation is adequate except for the odd mix of French greeting (“¡Bonjour y bienvenida”) which should be replaced with a purely Spanish greeting. Overall, the cultural references are kept intact and the language is tailored to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present; the script maintains the sequence of explanations about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning, as well as the discussion of memory features. No significant information was omitted, though a couple of nuanced sentences were slightly paraphrased. The content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and conveys the technical concepts accurately. It is largely readable and largely fluent, though a few awkward phrasings and a minor language mix detract from polish. Terminology usage is strong and the original intent is preserved. A slight improvement in style and consistency would raise the overall quality to near‑native level. Overall, the translation meets the basic requirements for a clear, accurate, and engaging Spanish‑language podcast script, but could benefit from minor refinements for naturalness and cultural consistency. The final overall score is 16/20, reflecting solid work with room for refinement in fluency and contextual adaptation issues that affect a small portion of the dialogue."
