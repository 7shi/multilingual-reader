  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. The sentences are mostly clear and logical, and the key concepts are introduced in a straightforward manner. Minor issues arise where the translation inserts extra words or phrases that slightly disrupt the flow, such as “la inteligencia conversacional limitada (ICL)” which is not a natural expression in Spanish and confuses the reader. Overall, readers can understand the content without much effort, though a few sections feel a bit choppy.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly in many places and the vocabulary is largely appropriate. However, there are occasional unnatural constructions and grammatical slips (“vuestras” instead of “tus”, “la IA no ha perdido la información” which feels formal for a podcast style, “Inteligencia Conversacional Limitada” is a wrong literalism). These errors lower the overall fluency. The translator also uses a mix of formal and informal register that is slightly inconsistent for a conversational podcast.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly retained correctly (“pre-entrenamiento”, “fine-tuning”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”). However, the abbreviation ICL is translated as “Inteligencia Conversacional Limitada”, which is a clear mistranslation. The term “grounding” is rendered as “anclaje”, which is acceptable, but the inconsistency in translating ICL hurts the term consistency. Overall, terminology is acceptable but not fully accurate.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation to Spanish is culturally appropriate. The use of “consultor” instead of “consultant” and the explanation of the concept using familiar analogies (bike riding, project consultant) fit the target audience. The translator keeps the podcast tone and the conversational style. The only contextual flaw is the wrong translation of ICL, which introduces a conceptual mismatch.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the information from the original is preserved. The dialogue flow is kept, the explanations of pre-training, fine-tuning, ICL, and the memory feature are all present. The main omission is the incorrect rendering of ICL, but no significant content is missing. Therefore, the translation is largely complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the gist of the original French text and is largely readable and fluent. However, it suffers from some terminology mistakes (especially with ICL) and minor grammatical errors. The content is largely complete and culturally adapted, so the translation is acceptable for a general audience but would need a quick review to fix the technical inaccuracies and polish the phrasing for a professional podcast publication."
