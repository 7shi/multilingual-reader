    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are clear, the dialogue format is preserved, and complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL, memory) are explained in a conversational tone that matches the original. Some sentences are a bit long or slightly formal, but overall a native Spanish speaker would understand the content without difficulty. Minor issues arise with occasional literal phrasing (“la IA no es constantemente afinada”) that could be smoother, yet readability is not compromised.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly natural and uses contemporary vocabulary. However, a few phrases sound awkward: \"La IA no es constantemente afinada\" (should be \"La IA no se afina constantemente\"), repeated adverbs in \"de forma automática\", and some verb tense inconsistencies. These are minor and do not impede comprehension, but they reduce the overall fluency of the text.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled appropriately. \"Fine‑tuning\" becomes \"ajuste fino\", \"in‑context learning\" is rendered as \"aprendizaje en contexto\", and \"grounding\" is \"anclaje\". The choices are consistent throughout and would be understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience familiar with AI. Minor adjustments (e.g., using \"ajuste fino\" once instead of twice) could improve consistency, but the terminology is solid.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone, keeping the informal podcast style. Cultural adaptation is adequate; however, some expressions could be more idiomatic, such as replacing \"la IA no es constantemente afinada\" with a more natural phrasing. The script’s flow is maintained, and references to “consultor brillante” and “consultor permanente” effectively mirror the French equivalents.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original appear in the Spanish version: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory features, and the consultant analogy. No critical content is omitted, and the translation adds a few clarifying phrases that aid understanding. The text remains concise and avoids unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of both source and target languages. It successfully retains the conversational style and technical accuracy required for a podcast script. While there are a handful of slightly awkward phrases and minor grammatical quirks, these do not significantly impede comprehension. With a few polishing touches—especially in the phrasing around model fine‑tuning and the repeated adverbial expression—the translation could reach a near‑perfect level of naturalness and fluency. Overall, it is a high‑quality, faithful translation suitable for native Spanish listeners of the podcast. 84/100 points total, split across the six evaluation criteria."
