    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows a logical sentence structure that mirrors the original. However, occasional literal translations and missing clarifications (e.g., the term “antiseche” instead of a more common Spanish equivalent) slightly hinder the flow for native readers. Overall, the content is readable but could be clearer in places.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural, but several phrases feel awkward or overly literal. Examples include “le proporcionamos simplemente la información que necesita” (better: “le proporcionamos la información necesaria”) and the use of the French word “antiseche” in Spanish. These choices reduce the smoothness of the text for native speakers. Minor grammatical slips also appear.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly translated: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje de transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"Memoria\". The major issue is the incorrect abbreviation of In‑Context Learning as \"AIL\" instead of the appropriate \"ICL\". This inconsistency can confuse readers familiar with the acronym. Otherwise, terminology is generally accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall tone and conversational style are preserved, which is good for the target audience. However, some cultural nuances are missed: the phrase “antiseche” is French and unfamiliar in Spanish; a more culturally appropriate expression would improve relatability. The translation does not exploit any Spanish idiomatic expressions that could enhance clarity.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation covers all major points of the original: pretraining, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No substantive content was omitted, and the overall narrative remains intact. A few explanatory details (e.g., the mechanics of prompt insertion) are present, though slightly abbreviated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers the core ideas but contains a few notable inaccuracies, particularly with the abbreviation of In‑Context Learning and some awkward phrasing. With minor revisions—correcting ICL, replacing the French “antiseche” with a Spanish equivalent, and smoothing a few phrases—the text would read naturally and be fully faithful to the original. Currently, the quality is solid but falls short of a perfect rendition."
