  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but the sentence structure is often awkward or overly fragmented. Short, isolated sentences such as \"El preentrenamiento.\" interrupt the flow. Paragraphs sometimes feel repetitive, which can make it harder for readers to follow the main narrative. A smoother, more connected prose would improve readability.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation includes many literal, word‑for‑word reproductions that sound unnatural to a native Spanish speaker. Phrases like \"¡Exacto! Y este aprendizaje comienza con un proceso llamado « preentrenamiento »\" read as a clumsy copy of the original. The repetition of words and the inconsistent use of capitalization (e.g., \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\" vs. \"aprendizaje en contexto\") further disrupt the natural flow. Overall, the translation is understandable but not smooth.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", etc. The terminology is consistent within each concept, though the translation sometimes rephrases or repeats terms (e.g., \"aprendizaje en contexto\" appears twice with different capitalization). The level of explanation is adequate for a general audience, but there are no extra clarifications for more complex terms, which could be helpful. Overall the terminology is acceptable but could be tightened.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and conversational tone, with friendly greetings and explanatory style. Cultural adaptation is generally good (e.g., opening with \"¡Hola y bienvenidos…\"). However, some expressions remain too literal, and the overall pacing feels more formal than the original French. Minor adjustments (e.g., smoother introductions, more natural colloquial phrases) would improve the adaptation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is present in the translation, including the key concepts of pretraining, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and memory mechanisms. Some nuances are lost or duplicated (e.g., the repeated explanation of pretraining, the abrupt isolation of single words). Overall the information conveyed is fairly comprehensive, but the text could be more concise and avoid redundancy. No major omissions are evident.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation accurately conveys the main ideas and terminology of the original French text, but it falls short in terms of natural flow and readability. The text feels heavily literal and occasionally fragmented, which can distract the reader. A more polished, contextually adapted version—perhaps reorganizing the sentences for better pacing and eliminating repetitive lines—would enhance clarity and engagement. The terminology is largely correct and consistent, yet the translation could benefit from a few more explanatory touches for complex concepts. Overall, the translation is competent but could be refined to achieve a more natural, engaging Spanish narrative. 14/20 points reflects solid work that needs some refinement in fluency and readability to reach a high‑quality standard. 13.8/20 is the average of the six criteria, rounded to 14.
