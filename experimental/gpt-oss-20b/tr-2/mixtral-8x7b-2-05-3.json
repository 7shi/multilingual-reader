  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable for native speakers, especially those familiar with tech podcasts. However, several sentences are awkwardly constructed, e.g., \"la IA no se ajusta continuamente por tus conversaciones\" or \"El modelo en sí no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus discusiones.\" These grammatical slips slightly hinder smooth comprehension. Despite this, the key ideas are conveyed and the overall flow is logical.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation uses appropriate vocabulary for the most part, but some phrases feel unnatural or literal, such as \"el aprendizaje en contexto\" (which is fine) versus \"el aprendizaje por transferencia\" (acceptable). The use of informal pronouns (tú) alongside formal structures, and some missing accents (e.g., \"recuerdan\") reduce the naturalness. Overall, the text would read more smoothly with minor edits.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms like *pre-entrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning* (translated as *afinar*), *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *anclaje* and *memoria a corto plazo* are mostly correct. The choice of *afinar* for fine‑tuning is understandable but slightly uncommon; *ajustar* might be preferable. The abbreviation ICL is kept as is, which is acceptable for the audience. Terminology consistency is good, but a few minor adjustments could improve precision.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator has adapted the content to a Spanish‑speaking context (e.g., changing cultural references and idioms). However, some sentences are directly translated from French and do not feel fully natural in Spanish, such as \"la IA no se ajusta continuamente por tus conversaciones\". Overall, the intent and purpose are preserved, but a smoother adaptation would enhance clarity.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French transcript is present. No major omissions were detected, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue. The content remains concise and clear, with no unnecessary repetition. Therefore, the translation is complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation effectively conveys the main ideas of the original French podcast script. It is mostly readable and understandable, but some grammatical and stylistic issues detract from its fluency. Terminology is largely correct, though a few terms could be refined for greater precision. Contextual adaptation is satisfactory, though a few phrases feel slightly literal. The translation retains all important information and remains concise. With minor revisions, it would read more naturally to a native Spanish audience. Overall, a solid effort with room for polish, especially regarding natural phrasing and terminology consistency. The translation is functional and serves its purpose well, but could benefit from a final proofread to address the noted issues. Overall score: 15/20."
