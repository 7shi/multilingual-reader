    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text is mostly smooth, but there are a few unnatural phrases such as \"Entienden todo\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto es como crammar\" which detract from naturalness. The vocabulary is generally appropriate, though some word choices (e.g., \"sintonización\" for fine‑tuning) are less common in everyday Spanish.",

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently. \"Preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are accurate. The choice of \"sintonización\" for fine‑tuning could be replaced by \"ajuste fino\" for clarity, but it does not impede understanding.",
