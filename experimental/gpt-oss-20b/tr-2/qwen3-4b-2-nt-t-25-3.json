  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, with clear explanations of the concepts. However, several long sentences make the flow a bit cumbersome, and some phrasing (“se envía una IA…”) feels awkward for native readers. Minor re‑structuring would improve readability.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds fairly natural overall, but there are noticeable grammatical slips and some unnatural expressions (e.g., “se envía una IA”, “un consultor excelente”, “pocas nuevas informaciones”). Consistency in article usage and smoother verb choices would raise the fluency score.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly translated – *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *In‑Context Learning*, *anclaje*. The mix of *ajuste fino* and *afinado* is an inconsistency. Overall, terminology is appropriate and largely consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation captures the original’s tone and intent. Some cultural nuances could be better handled (e.g., *recien licenciado* instead of *diplomado*, *consultor brillante* instead of *consultor excelente*). The script remains faithful but could be polished for a more native feel.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present; no significant information is omitted. The translator retained the dialogue structure and explanations, keeping the content concise while clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the core ideas accurately and remains largely faithful to the source text. While readability and fluency could benefit from minor edits—particularly smoothing long sentences and correcting some idiomatic choices—the technical terminology is well handled and the content is complete. With slight refinements, the translation would achieve a higher level of naturalness and clarity for native Spanish speakers. Overall, it is a competent translation suitable for most readers, though not yet polished to a top‑tier standard.  The overall score is 16/20, reflecting solid performance with room for improvement in fluency and consistency."
