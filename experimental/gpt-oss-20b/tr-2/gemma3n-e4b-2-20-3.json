    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑structured and the dialogue format is preserved, which helps readability. The explanations of key concepts are clear and the overall flow mirrors the original. Minor readability issues arise from a few awkward phrasings (e.g., \"atracción\" instead of the expected \"anclaje\"), but they do not obstruct understanding.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "For the most part the text reads naturally and the vocabulary is contemporary. However, there are several spots where the phrasing feels forced or incorrect, such as \"atracción\" (likely a mistranslation of \"ancrage\") and the slightly clunky use of quotation marks around generic terms. These moments lower the fluency slightly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms are correctly rendered: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *in‑context learning*. The only notable slip is the misuse of \"atracción\" for the term *ancrage*; the correct Spanish translation would be *anclaje* or *referencia*. Overall terminology is consistent and appropriate.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the intended tone and informal conversational style suitable for a podcast script. Cultural references are minimal and therefore not problematic. The adaptation to Spanish-speaking audiences is generally well done, with appropriate idiomatic expressions (e.g., \"es como contratar a un consultor brillante\").",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all content from the original is present. Minor omissions or paraphrasing occur (e.g., the direct mention of the French word *grounding* is partially lost due to the mistranslation). No major factual information is omitted, and the dialogue remains concise and coherent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and largely faithful to the original French script, capturing the key concepts and maintaining a conversational tone suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The main weaknesses lie in a few lexical errors—most notably the incorrect translation of \"ancrage\" as \"atracción\"—and some slightly awkward phrasing. Correcting these would raise the translation to an excellent standard while preserving its readability and clarity. Overall, it is a solid translation with room for refinement in terminology accuracy and naturalness."
