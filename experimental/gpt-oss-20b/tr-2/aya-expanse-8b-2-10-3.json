  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to read and the dialogue follows a clear, logical flow. However, there are a few minor issues that slightly impede comprehension, such as the plural‑singular agreement error in “Imaginen que envías” and the somewhat literal translation of “en la escuela” which feels awkward in Spanish. Despite these small problems, readers can understand the content and follow the conversation without major difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains several grammatical slips and awkward word choices that break the natural flow. Examples include “envías” instead of “envían”, the use of “en la escuela” rather than “para recibir educación general”, and the phrasing “para un examen y realmente comprender y dominar un tema?” which sounds forced. While the overall tone is conversational and most sentences read smoothly, these errors reduce the overall fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, memoria a corto plazo, etc. The translation remains consistent throughout and the reader can recognize these terms. Minor lapses appear in the phrase “aprender a hacer un resumen rápido,” which is not a standard technical expression but is understandable.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation stays faithful to the original intent and conveys the dialogue’s purpose well. Cultural adaptation is largely adequate; the language used is appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Some expressions could be more idiomatic, but overall the context is preserved, and no inappropriate or culturally insensitive content appears.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French source are present in the Spanish translation. No key information has been omitted, and the structure remains concise. The translation does not add extraneous content that would confuse the reader.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid overall, successfully conveying the dialogue’s meaning and technical concepts. Minor grammatical errors and slightly awkward phrasing detract from the naturalness of the text. With a few refinements, the Spanish version could achieve a higher level of polish."
