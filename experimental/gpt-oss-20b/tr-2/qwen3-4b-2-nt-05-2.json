  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, but several grammatical mistakes (e.g., *«Hola y bienvenido en»* instead of *«a»*, *«estas conocimientos»* instead of *«estos conocimientos»*) interrupt the flow. Sentence structures are mostly correct, yet some clauses feel disjointed, making quick comprehension a bit harder. A score of 13 reflects that readers can follow the main ideas but will occasionally stumble over syntax errors.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads as a draft rather than polished Spanish. There are awkward turns such as *«Ha entendido todo»* (should be *«Has entendido todo»*) and *«una forma astuciosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado»* which sounds clunky. Vocabulary choices are generally correct but sometimes literal (*«prompt»* without explanation). Overall naturalness is moderate; 12 is a fair estimate.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved, but inconsistencies appear: *«afinado»* for fine‑tuning, *«prompt»* without context, and *«contextual adaptation»* translated as *«aprendizaje en contexto»* repeatedly. Some concepts that could benefit from brief explanations (e.g., *«window of context»*) are not expanded. Consistency is acceptable but not optimal. A score of 11 reflects these issues.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the original structure and tone, but cultural nuances are not fully adapted. For example, the opening line uses *«Hola y bienvenido en»* which feels slightly off in Spanish contexts; a more natural *«Hola y bienvenido a»* would improve resonance. Nonetheless, the overall intent is preserved. 13 is a reasonable score.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most information from the original is present, but a few details are either missing or unclear due to grammar mistakes. The explanation of *ICL* and *memory* functions is present, but some redundancy exists (e.g., repeated mentions of *aprendizaje en contexto*). No major omissions are apparent, so a score of 14 is justified.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the main ideas of the French transcript and conveys the technical discussion to a Spanish-speaking audience. However, several grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent terminology diminish readability and naturalness. A more polished edit focusing on syntax, consistent technical vocabulary, and slight cultural tweaks would raise the quality considerably. As it stands, the translation is understandable but needs refinement to meet professional standards for a podcast transcript aimed at a Spanish-speaking tech audience. The overall score reflects a competent but improvable effort: 13/20."
