  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version presents a fairly straightforward narrative, but it contains several incomplete sentences, missing accents, and occasional breaks in the logical flow. Some passages are cut off or abruptly end, which hampers the reader’s ability to follow the dialogue smoothly. The overall structure remains recognizable, but the lack of full sentences and occasional dangling clauses reduce readability to about half the maximum score.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most vocabulary is appropriate, the text frequently features awkward phrasing, duplicated lines, and inconsistent tense usage (e.g., the repeated sentence “la IA no se está mejorando constantemente por sus conversaciones”). The lack of natural punctuation and occasional literal literalisms further lower the fluency. Native Spanish speakers would find some parts clumsy but still understandable.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"fine-tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are present and generally correct. However, the translation occasionally omits crucial context for these terms (e.g., the explanation of ICL) and introduces some redundancy. Overall, terminology is fairly accurate but could be more consistently explained.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original format and intent, but it fails to fully adapt idiomatic expressions or provide culturally relevant clarifications. Some French idioms are rendered literally, and the Spanish version does not fully leverage Spanish colloquialisms that could improve engagement. Nevertheless, the core message remains intact.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A significant portion of the original dialogue is missing in the translation (many lines after the \"fine‑tuning\" section are omitted). This loss of content severely impacts the completeness of the information conveyed. The translation also contains duplicated sentences and omitted explanations that were present in the source.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a basic grasp of the source material but suffers from multiple shortcomings: missing content, awkward phrasing, duplicated lines, and incomplete explanations of technical terms. It is understandable to a Spanish‑speaking audience but falls short of providing a smooth, complete, and fully faithful rendition. Significant revisions are needed to restore the missing sections, improve naturalness, and ensure consistent terminology usage before it can be considered a high‑quality translation. Overall score: 45/120. The translation is functional for a quick read but not suitable for a polished, professional publication without substantial editing."
