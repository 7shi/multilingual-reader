  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation follows the original structure closely, making the dialogue easy to follow. Sentences are generally clear and logical, and complex concepts are explained in a straightforward manner. Minor issues (e.g., repeated prepositional phrases) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally for a native Spanish speaker, though a few phrases feel slightly awkward, such as the repetition of \"en el aprendizaje en contexto\" and the use of \"reentrenar\" where \"ajuste fino\" would be preferable. Overall, the translation is smooth and appropriate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly accurate. \"Fine‑tuning\" is correctly rendered as \"ajuste fino\", but in several places it was mistranslated as \"reentrenar\" which could confuse readers. Consistency across the text is slightly compromised by this inconsistency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts idiomatic expressions to Spanish and maintains the informal, conversational tone of the podcast. Cultural references are handled appropriately, and the overall intent is preserved. Some opportunities for more natural phrasing were missed but do not undermine the communication.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present. No significant information was omitted, and the translation includes all explanations and analogies used in the source. The text remains concise while retaining clarity.",
      "score": 19
    },
