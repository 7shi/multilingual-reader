  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable to native speakers. Sentences are reasonably short and the overall flow follows the original structure. Some added explanatory sentences (e.g., the “memoria de elefante” metaphor) make the text slightly longer than necessary but do not hinder comprehension. Minor issues such as a missing article in “es como contratar a un consultor brillante” slightly affect clarity, leading to a score of 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation feels generally natural; however, there are a few awkward constructions: \"Aprendizaje In‑Contexto\" and \"marco contextual\" are not the most idiomatic choices, and the phrase \"es como contratar a un consultor brillante\" departs from the original meaning. The overall cadence is smooth, but these inconsistencies lower the fluency to 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered (pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL). Consistency is good except for minor deviations such as \"marco contextual\" versus the more usual \"ventana de contexto\". No critical terminology was lost, so the score is 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator captures the intent of the original and adapts cultural references appropriately, except for a slight inconsistency in the podcast title (Tech Rayo vs Tech Éclair) and an extraneous note “Adición sugerida:”. These do not distort meaning but reduce the precision of contextual adaptation, giving a score of 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French version is present. Minor omissions (e.g., the explicit mention of \"memoria a corto plazo\") are compensated by added clarifications, and there is no harmful redundancy. The translation remains concise yet comprehensive, earning 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and largely faithful to the original. It preserves the key concepts and the conversational tone, with only a few awkward phrasing and minor contextual errors. Overall, it is suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience with a reasonable level of technical understanding."
