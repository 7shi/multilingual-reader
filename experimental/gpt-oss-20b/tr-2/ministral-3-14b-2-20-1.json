  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is fragmented in several places, contains incomplete sentences (e.g., \"engager un consultant brillant\"), and uses inconsistent punctuation. As a result, a Spanish‑speaking listener would need to reread portions to grasp the meaning. Overall, readability is acceptable but far from fluent, earning a 10/20.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most vocabulary is familiar, the flow is disrupted by awkward phrasing, literal word‑for‑word transfers (e.g., \"preentrenado\" instead of \"preentrenamiento\"), and unfinished fragments. These issues make the text feel stilted, so it receives 9/20.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"in‑context learning\" are present, but the translation of \"grounding\" and some phraseologies are inconsistent or missing. The lack of a clear, consistent glossary leads to a 12/20 score.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original title \"Tech Éclair\" is rendered as \"Tecno Destello\", which diverges from the brand. Cultural references are not adapted (e.g., \"engager un consultant brillant\" remains a half‑translated French phrase). This mismatch lowers the score to 8/20.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several explanatory parts are truncated or omitted (e.g., the detailed description of ICL, the retrieval mechanism behind the \"Memoria\" feature). These gaps reduce clarity, so the score is 11/20.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation retains the basic storyline but suffers from many linguistic and structural flaws. Incomplete sentences, inconsistent terminology, and a lack of cultural adaptation hinder comprehension and naturalness. The overall quality is therefore below average; significant revision is needed for a professional Spanish version of the podcast script. The translation scores 9 out of 20 points in this evaluation. The translation is readable but lacks fluency and precise terminology usage. The overall quality is low; improvements are needed to convey the original meaning accurately and naturally. 9 out of 20 points."
