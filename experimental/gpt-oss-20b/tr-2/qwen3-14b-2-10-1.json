  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to read and follows the logical flow of the original French dialogue. Sentences are mostly clear, with complex ideas (e.g., transfer learning, in‑context learning) broken down in an understandable way. Minor hiccups – such as the slightly clunky phrase “¡Exactamente! Es el aprendizaje en contexto en práctica.” – do not hinder comprehension. Overall, readers can grasp the content without undue effort.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary choices are appropriate, and most sentences sound natural. A few awkward constructions appear, notably “¡Exactamente! Es el aprendizaje en contexto en práctica.” and the use of “Ya he escuchado este término” instead of the more common “Ya lo he oído.” Nonetheless, these do not severely disrupt the flow, so the overall fluency is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\", \"memoria a corto plazo\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\". The translations align with common usage in Spanish-speaking AI communities, and no critical term is missing or mistranslated. A few terms (e.g., \"afinamiento\" vs. \"ajuste fino\") are acceptable alternatives.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapted expressions to fit Spanish colloquial style without losing the original intent. Phrases such as “Es el aprendizaje en contexto en práctica” or the use of interjections (“¡Exactamente!”) feel natural in Spanish. Cultural references are preserved, and the adaptation enhances readability for Spanish listeners, though some minor phrasing could be more idiomatic. The overall purpose and tone remain intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All sections of the original French dialogue are represented in the Spanish version. No key idea (e.g., the contrast between fine‑tuning and in‑context learning, the discussion about memory features) is omitted. The translation maintains the same length and detail level, providing a concise yet comprehensive account of the concepts. Minor stylistic differences do not affect completeness.",

    },
