  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable, but several sentences are overly long or contain awkward punctuation (e.g., the comma after \"contexto\"). The explanation of complex concepts is clear enough for a general audience, though occasional repetitions (e.g., \"la IA la utiliza\") slightly obscure meaning. Overall, readability is solid but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains several unnatural expressions and minor grammatical errors. Phrases like \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es del aprendizaje superficial\" are ungrammatical; the repeated use of \"la IA la utiliza\" is awkward. Vocabulary choices are mostly correct, but the overall flow could be smoother, and the use of the English term \"prompt\" feels out of place for a Spanish-speaking audience. Fluency is acceptable but noticeably imperfect.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL), \"anclaje\", \"memoria a corto plazo\". The translation keeps the original terminology and does not omit any key concepts. Minor issues include the inconsistent use of \"afinamiento\" vs. \"fine‑tuning\" in one line, but overall terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the conversational tone and cultural references, with only minor adjustments needed for natural Spanish usage (e.g., \"bienvenido a\" instead of \"en\"). The content is adapted appropriately to Spanish listeners, though some stylistic tweaks could improve engagement. The adaptation effectively conveys the original intent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The majority of the original dialogue is present. However, one line remains untranslated: \"Telle est la réalité de l'ICL.\" This omission slightly reduces completeness. No major concepts are missing, and the translation does not add extraneous information, keeping the content concise.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the core ideas and most technical terms accurately, but it is marred by a few awkward phrasings, minor grammatical errors, and a single untranslated sentence. It is understandable to a general audience but would benefit from a smoother, more natural prose and a final review to catch small omissions. Overall, it is a competent but not polished translation, suitable for general listeners with some tolerance for minor quirks.\n\nOverall score: 15.8/20 (rounded to 16/20)."
