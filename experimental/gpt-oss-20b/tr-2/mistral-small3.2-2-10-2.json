  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version keeps the dialogue flow and uses short, conversational sentences that are easy to follow. Minor readability issues arise from repeated phrasing (e.g., *Aprendizaje en Contexto* used twice in one sentence) and a few awkward constructions (*el sistema busca rápidamente en sus antiguos intercambios*). Overall, readers can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds generally natural to native speakers, but several expressions feel slightly forced or redundant. Phrases such as *El aprendizaje contextual, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto).* and the repeated use of capitalized terms can interrupt the smooth flow. The choice of vocabulary is appropriate, yet some sentences could be more concise and idiomatic. Fluency is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *anclaje* for *grounding*. The translation provides clear equivalents for most concepts. The only minor inconsistency is the interchangeable use of *aprendizaje contextual* and *aprendizaje en contexto*, which might slightly confuse the reader. Terminology is otherwise accurate and clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue retains its informal tone and humor, and cultural references are adapted appropriately. However, the original podcast title *Tech Éclair* was translated to *Tecnología Rápida*, which changes the branding and could mislead listeners familiar with the original. Aside from that, expressions are suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience and the adaptation is effective overall.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the entire structure and content of the original script. No significant information is omitted, and explanations of key concepts are retained. The only subtle change is the brand name, which does not alter the informational content. The translation is concise, avoids unnecessary repetition, and keeps the same logical flow.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is faithful to the original text, conveying the technical concepts and conversational style well. It reads clearly and employs correct terminology, but some redundant phrasing and a brand name change slightly detract from its polish. Overall, the translation is of high quality and suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience, with a few areas for refinement to achieve full naturalness and consistency. 80/100 points reflects these strengths and minor weaknesses, making the work competent but not perfect. 80/100"
