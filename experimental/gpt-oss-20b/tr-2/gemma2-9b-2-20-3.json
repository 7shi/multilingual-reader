  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the clear, logical flow of the original dialogue and explains complex concepts in straightforward Spanish. Sentences are mostly concise, though a few run‑on structures slightly reduce ease of reading. Overall, readers should understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text generally sounds natural to Spanish speakers; however, some phrases are a bit awkward (e.g., “es una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado” and “se le ha dado una pista” instead of more idiomatic equivalents). Minor grammatical adjustments could improve smoothness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered (preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding → anclaje) and are consistently used throughout. Explanations for non‑native terms are present where needed, ensuring accessibility.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the original intent and humor, adapting expressions to Spanish culture (e.g., analogies with “aprender a andar en bicicleta”). Cultural references are appropriate, and the dialogue feels tailored to Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script appear in the Spanish version. No essential information is omitted, and the dialogue remains concise. Some redundancies are avoided while preserving clarity.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is highly accurate and faithful to the original. It conveys technical concepts clearly and is largely natural for native listeners, with only minor stylistic and grammatical tweaks needed. The overall quality is excellent, making it suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI topics."
