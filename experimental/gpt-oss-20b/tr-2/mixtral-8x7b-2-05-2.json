    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable for a native reader and follows the conversational flow of the original. However, some sentences are overly long or slightly confusing, such as the fragmented “afinar' al IA” line. Additionally, a few transitions feel abrupt, which can momentarily disrupt the reader’s flow.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the translation is readable, several expressions feel unnatural or grammatically incorrect. Examples include “afinar' al IA” and the intermingling of “ancraje”/“anclaje.” The use of the English word “prompt” in a Spanish context also detracts from overall fluency. A smoother, more idiomatic phrasing would improve the naturalness of the text.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding (translated as anclaje/ancraje), and fine‑tuning (afinar) are generally handled correctly. Inconsistent use of “prompt” and the slightly informal “memoria” are minor issues, but overall terminology remains accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation preserves the core intent of the original and respects cultural context, e.g., translating “Tech Éclair” to “Tech Iluminación.” Some expressions, however, feel less natural or slightly off (e.g., “afinar' al IA”). The overall message is conveyed, but a more polished cultural adaptation would raise the score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the memory feature. Minor omissions or repetitions are negligible, and no essential information is lost.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main ideas clearly and includes the key technical concepts. Nevertheless, its fluency suffers from grammatical slips and some unnatural phrasing, and a few terms are inconsistently rendered. With a few refinements in style and terminology consistency, the translation would reach a higher standard."
