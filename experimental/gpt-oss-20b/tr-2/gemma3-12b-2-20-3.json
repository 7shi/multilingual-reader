  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally clear and follows the original’s logical flow.  Minor issues such as the unnecessary article in “en la Internet” and the occasional gender mismatch (“una conocimiento”) slightly reduce readability, but overall the text remains comprehensible to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural, but there are a few awkward constructions and language mix‑ups (e.g., “hacer du vélo”, “l’équilibre”, “en coulisses”). These do not break comprehension, yet they reduce the overall fluency. The translation would feel slightly more polished if these were corrected.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pré‑entraînement*, *affinage*, *apprentissage en contexte* are accurately rendered (*pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje en contexto*). The occasional mis‑gendering of nouns does not affect the technical content, so the terminology score is high.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references remain appropriate for a Spanish audience, and no mistranslations of idioms or expressions occur. The adaptation is effective, with only minor inconsistencies in mixed‑language phrases.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present in the Spanish version; no key information is omitted, and the dialogue structure remains intact. The only omissions are tiny linguistic errors, not substantive content gaps.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the core meaning and style of the original French script with high fidelity. The text is readable and largely fluent, though a few linguistic slips (mixed languages, gender errors, and anachronistic article usage) detract from perfect polish. The technical terminology is handled correctly and consistently. Overall, it is a solid translation that would serve a Spanish‑speaking audience well, with minor edits recommended for a flawless final version. The average score reflects strong translation quality with small room for improvement in fluency and minor grammatical precision. Overall Score: 18/20."
