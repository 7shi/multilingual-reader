  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable to native readers. Sentences are mostly clear, though some are quite long and could be broken up for easier reading. The explanation of complex concepts like pre‑training and in‑context learning is adequate, but occasional wordy phrasing slightly hampers flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains a few awkward or unnatural expressions, e.g., “Lo entendieron todo” (better: “Lo entendiste todo”), and some literal phrasings that feel stilted. Overall, however, the language is smooth and modern, with appropriate vocabulary for a general audience. Minor adjustments would raise the naturalness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: ‘pré‑entraînement’ → ‘preentrenamiento’, ‘fine‑tuning’ remains in English (acceptable), ‘ICL’ and ‘ventana de contexto’ are correctly translated. Some explanatory phrases are missing, but the core terminology is accurate and understandable.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts expressions to Spanish-speaking culture, using idiomatic equivalents where possible. It preserves the original intent and maintains a conversational tone suitable for a podcast audience. Minor improvements could enhance cultural resonance in a few lines.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French original is present, with no omitted concepts. Minor repetitions occur (e.g., repeated explanation of in‑context learning), but no critical content is missing. The translation remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation effectively conveys the main ideas and maintains a natural, approachable tone. While there are a few awkward phrasings and slight redundancies, the overall quality is good and suitable for a general audience. Minor refinements in fluency and sentence structure would bring it to an excellent standard."
