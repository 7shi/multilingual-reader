  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text follows a clear, logical sentence structure and the main concepts—pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, and memory—are explained in a way that is easy to understand for a general audience. Some long sentences could be split for even greater clarity, but overall the text remains comprehensible.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in Spanish, with idiomatic expressions and appropriate vocabulary for most parts. Minor awkwardness appears in phrases such as \"un enfoque más flexible está surgiendo\" (better: \"está emergiendo\") and the occasional literal carry‑over of the French term \"ancrage\". These do not hinder understanding, but a more consistent Spanish phrasing would improve fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are generally preserved—\"pre-entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\"—and the context is explained. However, the untranslated French word \"ancrage\" appears within the translation and is not consistently rendered (the Spanish equivalent would be \"anclaje\"). This inconsistency slightly weakens the terminology handling.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original podcast style to Spanish, using appropriate salutations, informal dialogue, and cultural references (e.g., \"TecnoRelámpago\"). The overall intent and tone of the original French script are preserved, and the adaptation considers Spanish-speaking listeners.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French text is present in the Spanish translation. No sections are omitted, and the additional explanation about the \"memory\" feature is included accurately. Minor stylistic differences do not affect the content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful to the original, maintains the conversational tone, and conveys the technical concepts clearly. Minor issues—such as the residual French term \"ancrage\" and a few slightly awkward phrasings—prevent it from being perfect. With some minor edits, it could achieve near‑native quality."
