    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. The sentence structure closely mirrors the original, making the flow natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Complex concepts such as pre‑training and in‑context learning are explained in simple terms. A few small syntactic oddities (e.g., “Se lee una cantidad masiva…” instead of “Lee una cantidad…”) do not hinder comprehension, but they slightly reduce overall readability. Overall, the text is highly readable for the intended audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences read smoothly and sound natural to native speakers. Minor awkwardness arises from literal translations of phrases like “el modelo en sí” or “memoria a corto plazo” that could be phrased more idiomatically (“el propio modelo” or “memoria a corto plazo”), but these do not break the flow. The use of modern vocabulary (“finetuning” → “ajuste fino”) is appropriate and contemporary. Thus the translation is fluent with small room for improvement.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “in‑context learning” → “aprendizaje en contexto”, “grounding” → “anclaje”. The translator preserves the meaning and keeps the terminology appropriate for a general audience. No major mistranslations or omissions occur. The terminology is therefore highly appropriate.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and tone, preserving the conversational style and humor. Cultural adaptation is adequate: expressions such as “¿no es así?” replace “n’est‑ce pas ?”, fitting Spanish colloquialism. The adaptation respects the target audience’s background while retaining the message. No significant cultural mismatches are observed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French source is present. The dialogue is fully rendered, and no sentences or ideas are omitted. The translation includes the same examples and analogies (e.g., learning a language, riding a bike). The text remains concise and clear without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality. It faithfully conveys the original content, preserves technical accuracy, and reads well for native Spanish speakers. Minor refinements could enhance fluency, but overall the translation is effective and well‑adapted for its intended audience. The average score reflects this strong performance across all criteria. This translation demonstrates a good balance of fidelity, clarity, and naturalness, making it suitable for a podcast audience that seeks both understanding and engaging dialogue. The score reflects a solid 18.6/20, indicating a very competent translation with only minor points for polish and idiomatic improvement. Overall, an excellent job that successfully bridges French and Spanish without losing nuance or meaning."
