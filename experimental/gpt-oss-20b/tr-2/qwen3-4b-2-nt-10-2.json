  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to understand; most concepts are conveyed with clear explanations. However, some long, compound sentences could be simplified for a broader audience. Overall, readers can follow the dialogue without significant confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for native speakers, though a few English loan‑words such as “prompt” and the capitalization of “Aprendizaje en contexto” feel slightly out of place. The language is contemporary and appropriate, but minor adjustments would improve naturalness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “aprendizaje en contexto,” “ajuste fino/afinado,” “transferencia de aprendizaje” are all correct and consistent. Minor inconsistencies appear (e.g., “ajuste fino” vs “afinado”), but overall terminology is accurate and understandable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references are adapted appropriately, though a few idiomatic choices (e.g., “silla” instead of “bicicleta” for the cycling analogy) could be refined. The target audience’s expectations are met.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all content from the original is retained, including nuanced explanations and examples. No significant omissions are present; redundancy is minimal, and the dialogue remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a strong grasp of the source material and delivers clear, mostly natural Spanish prose. Minor refinements in phrasing and consistency would elevate it to near‑perfect quality. Overall, it is a competent and well‑executed translation."
