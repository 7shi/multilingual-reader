  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are clear and logical, with most complex ideas explained simply. A few phrases feel slightly awkward – e.g. *ajuste preciso* instead of the more common *ajuste fino* – but overall readers can grasp the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural to a native Spanish speaker. Minor unnatural expressions (e.g., *ajuste preciso*, the untranslated *ancrage*) detract from full fluency, but the flow and rhythm of the dialogue are preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely correct: *entrenamiento previo*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*. The misuse of *ancrage* (should be *anclaje*) and the choice *ajuste preciso* instead of *ajuste fino* introduce small inaccuracies, yet overall terminology remains appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation of the podcast name from *Tech Éclair* to *Tecno Flash* and later to *Tecnología al Instante* is inconsistent and may confuse listeners familiar with the original branding. Aside from that, cultural references are suitable and the tone matches a casual tech podcast.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present. No substantive content is omitted, and the translation includes the necessary explanatory details. Minor repetitions are acceptable in the dialogue context.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the gist of the original with good readability and fluency, but small terminology slips (particularly with *ancrage* and *ajuste preciso*) and inconsistent brand name adaptations slightly reduce the overall quality. It would benefit from a final proof‑read to correct these issues and standardize the podcast name throughout the episode. Overall, it is a solid translation that could be polished to near‑perfect level with minor adjustments. 18/20 points in total, which reflects an above‑average performance with room for minor refinements. The overall score is an average of the individual criteria, giving a final score of 18 out of 20.  This demonstrates competent translation skills while highlighting areas for improvement in terminology consistency and contextual alignment. The translation remains faithful to the original intent and effectively communicates the complex concepts to a Spanish‑speaking audience.  Overall, it’s a strong, professional effort with only minor adjustments needed for full precision.  Final score: 18/20."
