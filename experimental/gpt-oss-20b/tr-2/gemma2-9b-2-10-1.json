  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to read and the flow of the dialogue is clear. However, some long sentences (e.g., the ones describing the process of memory retrieval) could be split for better comprehension. Overall, the text is understandable for a general audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but a few literal phrasings (e.g., \"ventana de contexto\" instead of the more common \"finestra de contexto\" in some Spanish‑speaking regions) and slightly awkward word order in a couple of lines slightly interrupt the smoothness. Vocabulary is contemporary and appropriate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre‑entrenado*, *fine‑tuning*, *aprendizaje por transferencia* and *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)* are correctly translated and consistently used throughout. Explanations of the concepts are retained, which helps comprehension.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French intent for a Spanish audience, using culturally relevant expressions and avoiding overly literal wording. Minor improvements could be made to make some idioms more idiomatic, but the overall intent is well preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original transcript is present; no key details are omitted. Redundancy is minimal, and the content remains concise while keeping the dialogue’s flow.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the meaning, terminology, and tone of the original. Minor refinements in phrasing and sentence structure would bring it to near‑perfect fluency, but the current version is already clear, accurate, and well adapted for Spanish‑speaking listeners."
