  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely comprehensible, but several long, choppy sentences and literal translations make it feel a bit cumbersome for native Spanish readers. The core concepts are explained adequately, yet the flow could be smoother.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several grammatical and orthographic issues (e.g., missing accent in “¿Porque”, awkward phrasing such as “El proceso de aprendizaje inicia…”) that hinder naturalness. The overall tone is acceptable, but it reads more like a literal rendering than polished Spanish.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly accurate and consistently used (pre-entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, anclaje). Minor inconsistencies (ajuste fino vs. afinamiento) and occasional non‑technical wording (la IA se alimenta) appear, but they do not distort meaning.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and dialogue style. Cultural adaptation is adequate (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenidos!”). Some expressions remain overly literal, but overall the message remains clear and appropriate for a Spanish-speaking audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant content is omitted; the narrative flow and key details are retained. Minor typographical mistakes and slight shifts in wording (e.g., “partes de un contexto vacío”) do not materially affect understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version faithfully conveys the original French dialogue and concepts, but suffers from a few awkward phrasings, grammatical errors, and overly literal constructions. With minor polishing—especially in terms of punctuation, accents, and smoother sentence structures—the translation would read as natural, fluent Spanish while maintaining technical accuracy and completeness. Overall, it’s a solid effort that would benefit from a final stylistic review to polish the flow and correct small errors. 16/20 is an appropriate overall score, reflecting a good but improvable translation quality. 16/20"
