  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely comprehensible and follows a clear sentence structure that mirrors the French original. However, some expressions feel a bit literal (e.g., “la IA le da una cultura general”), which slightly hinders fluid understanding. Overall, the target readers can grasp the content with minor effort.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text generally sounds natural for Spanish speakers, using idiomatic expressions such as “ajuste fino” and “aprendizaje en contexto”. Minor quirks appear – the phrasing “la IA le da una cultura general” is somewhat clunky, and occasional tense inconsistencies surface. Nonetheless, the translation reads smoothly for the most part.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: “pre-entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “ICL”, “anclaje” and “memoria” are all appropriate. The glossary remains faithful to the original and is suitable for the audience’s comprehension level.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the conversational tone and cultural references of the original. Phrases like “¡Hola y bienvenidos a « Tech Éclair »!” and “¡Gracias por habernos escuchado!” fit well with Spanish podcast conventions. No major cultural misunderstandings or awkward adaptations are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All core ideas from the French source are retained. No substantive information is omitted; the flow of explanation about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL, and memory features is maintained. The only slight difference is a minor re‑ordering of a sentence, which does not affect overall content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid overall, faithfully conveying the meaning, tone, and technical content of the original French podcast script. While a few sentences could be polished for greater naturalness, the text remains clear, fluent, and technically accurate, making it suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience familiar with AI concepts."
