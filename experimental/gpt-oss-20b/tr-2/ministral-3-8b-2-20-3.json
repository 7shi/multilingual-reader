  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, but it contains several awkward sentence structures, repetitive phrasing, and occasional grammatical mistakes (e.g., gender agreement in \"se vuelve tan inteligentes\"). The overall flow is maintained, yet some passages read like a literal, literal translation rather than natural prose.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text feels mechanical in places, with a few glaring errors such as the gender mistake \"se vuelve tan inteligentes\" and the repeated use of \"aplica\" where it should be a noun or a different verb. Some phrases, like \"la IA es como un joven graduado de la universidad\", are fine, but overall the rhythm is uneven and a native speaker would likely smooth it out.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly correct: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL). However, there are inconsistencies (e.g., sometimes \"aplica\" instead of \"aplicación\" or \"aplicación de\"), and the term \"grounding\" is translated as \"anclaje\", which is acceptable. Minor errors reduce consistency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adds several lines not present in the original (e.g., \"Camille: O sea... ¿Qué quieres decir con eso, Luc?\"), rearranges the dialogue, and occasionally misinterprets the speaker’s intent. While the overall meaning remains, the fidelity to the original script is compromised, reducing the effectiveness for a target audience expecting a faithful rendition.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation omits some exchanges, duplicates others, and introduces extraneous content. Key information is generally present, but important nuances and some lines from the French source are missing or altered. The text is not fully comprehensive, and redundancy is present in the added dialogue.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the main ideas and most of the terminology, but it suffers from grammatical inaccuracies, unnatural phrasing, and a lack of fidelity to the original dialogue. The added content and inconsistencies weaken the overall quality. A more careful, faithful rendering would improve readability, fluency, and completeness substantially. Overall, the work is serviceable but requires significant revision to meet professional standards for a native Spanish audience."
