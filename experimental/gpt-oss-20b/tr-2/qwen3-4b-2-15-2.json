  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand and follows a logical sentence structure. However, several expressions are awkward or slightly literal, such as *“aprendizaje de último momento”* or *“en sus antiguos intercambios”*. These quirks make the text less smooth and sometimes confusing for native readers. A cleaner phrasing would improve overall readability.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains numerous unnatural constructions (e.g., *“Usted ha entendido todo.”*, *“aprendizaje de último momento”*). The rhythm and flow feel uneven, and some phrases read more like literal word‑for‑word translation than natural Spanish. This lowers the fluency of the text.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and understandable: *preentrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *anclaje*. Some choices, like *afinamiento* for *fine‑tuning*, are acceptable but less common than *ajuste fino*. Overall, terminology is consistent and appropriate for a general audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation captures the original intent but could better suit Spanish‑speaking audiences. For instance, *“Hola y bienvenido en”* should be *“Hola y bienvenido a”*, and *“el programa de formación de varios años”* sounds awkward. Cultural references are minimal, so the main issue is style rather than content.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points and dialogue exchanges from the French original are present; no significant omissions or additions. The translation remains concise and clear, though a few phrases could be tightened for brevity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original message and most technical details accurately, but suffers from several natural‑language issues that affect readability and fluency. While terminology is largely correct, some word choices and phrasing feel literal and could be polished. Overall, the translation is competent but would benefit from a final stylistic review to improve clarity and naturalness for native Spanish speakers."
