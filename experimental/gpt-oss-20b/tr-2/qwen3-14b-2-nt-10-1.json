  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish dialogue is mostly easy to follow and conveys the core ideas clearly. However, a few pronoun and verb‑tense mismatches (e.g., *Pueden* instead of *Puedes*, *Entendieron* instead of *Entendí*/*Entendiste*) make some sentences feel slightly disjointed, which slightly hampers smooth comprehension. Overall, the listener can still grasp the content but some awkward phrasing requires extra effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the natural flow of conversation for most parts, but the presence of several grammatical slips (mis‑subject pronouns, wrong verb forms, occasional literal word‑by‑word rendering) detracts from the overall naturalness. These issues break the rhythmic flow for native Spanish speakers, making the text feel less polished. The vocabulary is appropriate, but the fluency is hindered by the errors.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and accurately translated: *pre-entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *ventana de contexto*, *anclaje*. The consistency is good and the target audience is expected to understand them. No major terminology mistakes or confusing paraphrasing appear. Minor consistency issue: *ajuste fino* is used once but the French original sometimes uses *fine‑tuning*; however, the chosen Spanish equivalent is widely accepted. Overall, terminology is handled well.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural adaptation is minimal but appropriate (e.g., *Hola y bienvenida* instead of a literal translation). The script’s structure and humor are preserved, and the Spanish idioms used are natural. The adaptation could be slightly smoother in a few spots (e.g., addressing the speaker correctly), but overall the context is well conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the dialogue lines from the French original are present in the Spanish version, including the subtle points about memory and ICL. The only omission is the untranslated French phrase *D'accord*, which is a minor oversight and does not significantly impact understanding. No essential information is missing, and redundancy is avoided.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and largely faithful to the source, capturing both the technical content and the conversational nuance. Minor grammatical and pronoun errors reduce fluency, but the core meaning remains clear. With a few edits to correct verb forms and pronoun usage, the text would read as a natural, professional Spanish script. Overall, it’s a competent translation that would serve well for a Spanish‑speaking audience with minimal polishing needed.  Overall score: 84/100 (average of 16+13+18+18+19 = 84)."
