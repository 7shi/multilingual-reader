  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is generally clear and easy to follow for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Sentences are well‑structured and complex concepts are adequately explained. Minor run‑on sentences slightly reduce flow, but overall the passage remains comprehensible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, but several constructions feel slightly awkward or non‑idiomatic to native speakers. Examples include \"la IA le lo leemos\" (incorrect word order), \"el modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona\" (clunky phrasing), and the repetitive use of \"la IA\" in quick succession. Vocabulary is generally appropriate, though some phrases could be more concise.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is largely accurate and consistent: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\". The translator correctly retains key concepts and uses Spanish equivalents that are commonly understood in the tech field. Minor clarifications (e.g., explicit definition of ICL) could improve accessibility for less‑technical listeners.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The cultural tone of the original podcast is preserved, with friendly, conversational phrasing suitable for a Spanish audience. However, some expressions could be further localized—for instance, replacing literal translations of French idioms or slightly adapting the metaphor about a consultant. Overall, adaptation is effective but could be polished for a smoother cultural fit.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French script are present in the Spanish version. The translator maintains the dialogue structure, key explanations, and narrative flow. There is no loss of substantive information, and no unnecessary repetition that would detract from clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and largely faithful to the source. It effectively conveys the technical concepts and the conversational tone of the podcast. Improvements could focus on smoothing certain awkward phrasings and tightening some sentences for greater naturalness. Overall, it is a strong translation that would be well understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners with minimal difficulty or confusion. The final score is 17.5 out of 20, reflecting a solid but not perfect execution of the target language’s idiomatic and stylistic norms. This level of quality would be suitable for a general audience with a moderate technical background, though a final polish could elevate it to a near‑native level of fluency and polish."
