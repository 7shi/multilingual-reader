    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable to a native speaker, and the main concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory) are conveyed. However, a few sentences are awkward or poorly punctuated (e.g., “Es lógico. Como lo discutimos…”, “El aprendizaje en contexto se asemeja al empollado”). These minor issues slightly reduce clarity, but overall the dialogue remains easy to follow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the prose reads smoothly, but there are a number of unnatural expressions and inconsistent capitalization (e.g., “Aprendizaje en Contexto” vs. “aprendizaje en contexto”), as well as some odd phrasing (“empollado”, “Es lógico”). The dialogue still sounds conversational, yet the fluency is not perfect and could benefit from polishing.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje (grounding). The consistency is good, though the acronym ICL is used without expansion and some terms like “memoria” could be clarified as “memoria de contexto”. Overall the terminology is appropriate for a technical audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation takes into account the Spanish-speaking audience; cultural references are kept neutral and the dialogue format is preserved. Some idiomatic choices (e.g., “Es lógico”) feel slightly forced, and certain expressions could be more naturally adapted. Nonetheless, the intent and tone of the original are largely maintained.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Nearly all information from the French original is present. The main dialogue turns, key explanations, and examples are translated. Minor omissions or truncations are noticeable in a few lines (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto se asemeja al empollado.” is a shortened form of the original explanation), but these do not materially change the overall content.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and comprehensible, capturing the essential concepts and dialogue flow. However, it would benefit from a review to smooth out some awkward phrasing, standardize terminology (especially acronyms), and ensure consistent capitalization and punctuation. With these refinements, the Spanish version would read more naturally to a native audience while preserving the technical depth of the original French script."
