  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the sentence structure is logical. However, some clauses feel slightly disjointed (e.g., the transition from one speaker to another) and a few phrases could be smoother for a native audience. Overall, readers can understand the technical concepts without much difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most parts, but there are a few minor grammatical slips such as \"Cuando abre una nueva ventana\" instead of \"Cuando abres…\" and occasional gender inconsistencies with \"Ella\" vs. \"la IA.\" The vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, though some expressions feel slightly literal. The overall fluency is solid but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", etc. The translation consistently uses these terms throughout. The only slight mismatch is the use of \"memoria a corto plazo\" for \"context window,\" but it remains understandable. Terminology handling is excellent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation respects the target audience’s cultural context: metaphors like a brilliant consultant and references to a bike are relatable. The Spanish version avoids overly formal French phrasing and instead uses idiomatic Spanish. Minor adjustments could improve nuance, but overall the intent is preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. No essential information is omitted, and the translation is concise without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, conveying the original content clearly while largely maintaining natural Spanish flow. Minor grammatical and consistency issues slightly lower the fluency, but these are easily fixable. The technical terms are accurate and consistent, and the cultural adaptation is appropriate."
