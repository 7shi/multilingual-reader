  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation mixes Spanish and French in several places (e.g., \"Telle est la réalité de l'ICL.\"), which makes the text confusing for a Spanish‑speaking reader. When the language is consistent, the sentences are mostly understandable, but the abrupt switches interrupt the flow and obscure the intended meaning. Overall, the readability is limited to about 40 % of the target level.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many phrases sound clumsy or are literal literal translations that do not reflect natural Spanish usage. Examples include \"se vuelven tan avanzados tecnológicamente\" and \"desentrañamos la tecnología\". The presence of French fragments further breaks fluency. Naturalness is therefore low.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL) are correctly translated. However, consistency suffers because some terms are repeated with different forms or are surrounded by untranslated French. The explanation of concepts is adequate but occasionally over‑elaborated or mis‑aligned with the original.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator attempted to localize some expressions (e.g., \"consultor brillante\"), but the mixture of languages prevents a coherent adaptation. Cultural references remain largely unchanged, and the adaptation does not fully account for the target audience's expectations. The overall effectiveness of the conveyance is therefore moderate.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is present, although some additional explanatory sentences are inserted that were not in the French source. A few details are omitted or misrepresented (e.g., the phrase \"Le pré‑entraînement\" is simply translated as \"preentrenamiento\" without context). No major omissions, but the consistency of the narrative is compromised.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation shows a basic grasp of the terminology and some effort at localizing expressions, but it is marred by frequent French fragments, unnatural phrasing, and inconsistent language use. These issues severely limit its readability and fluency for a Spanish audience. While the information is largely preserved, the mixed‑language style undermines the professionalism and clarity expected of a high‑quality translation. Overall, the work is acceptable for informal use but requires significant revision for any formal or public-facing context. The score reflects this mixed performance: a moderate completeness and terminology accuracy counterbalanced by poor fluency and readability, yielding a low overall rating. The translator should aim for a fully consistent Spanish text, careful handling of idiomatic expressions, and a more faithful rendering of the original conversational tone to improve the quality substantially."
