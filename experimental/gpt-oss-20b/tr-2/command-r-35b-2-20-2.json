  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to read and follows a clear conversational structure. Sentences are mostly short and the dialogue flow is maintained. However, some phrases are slightly awkward or repetitive (e.g., “en la ventana de conversación” repeated many times, “por lo tanto” used in quick succession). Minor punctuation issues also affect flow. Overall, readers can understand the content without much effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds fairly natural for native Spanish speakers, but there are a few spots where the phrasing feels forced: “en el marco de contexto” instead of the more common “ventana de contexto”, and the sentence “pero en realidad le hemos proporcionado únicamente una ayuda justo antes de que comenzara a hablarle” is somewhat clunky. The use of exclamation marks and some missing accents also reduce smoothness. Despite these, the text remains intelligible and not overly stilted.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL). The choice of “enraizamiento” for “grounding” is acceptable but not the most common term in Spanish (often “anclaje”). Consistency is good overall, though the occasional mismatch of “marco de contexto” vs “ventana de contexto” may confuse readers who are used to a single standard term.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue retains its informal, conversational tone appropriate for a podcast. Cultural references are minimal, so no significant adaptation was needed. Minor changes (e.g., “Tech Relámpago” for “Tech Éclair”) are suitable. Overall, the intent and purpose are effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines, questions, and answers from the original French text are present. No major omissions or additions that alter the meaning. The only minor loss is a slightly different word choice (“enraizamiento” vs “ancrage”), but it does not affect comprehension. Redundancy is kept minimal and the translation remains concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and conveys the original content’s meaning and tone. Minor issues in fluency and terminology slightly detract from a perfectly polished result, but overall the text is readable, faithful, and appropriate for Spanish‑speaking podcast listeners. Some wording could be refined to increase naturalness and consistency, but it is functional and clear in its current form."
