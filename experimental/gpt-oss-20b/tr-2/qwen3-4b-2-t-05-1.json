  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely understandable, but several sentences are awkwardly constructed or contain grammatical errors that impede smooth reading. The overall sense of the dialogue is clear, yet the flow is sometimes interrupted by literal phrasing that feels unnatural in Spanish.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains multiple instances of literal word‑for‑word translation that break the natural rhythm of Spanish, such as \"El afinado…\" (should be \"el ajuste fino\"), \"apretar para un examen\" (should be \"bachetar\" or \"estudiar intensamente\"), and improper use of formal pronouns. These issues reduce fluency and make the translation feel stilted in several spots.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\", \"contexto\". However, a few terms are misapplied (e.g., \"El afinado\" instead of \"ajuste fino\"), and the use of \"apretar\" for \"bachetar\" is incorrect. Terminology is generally consistent, but small mistakes lower the score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent of the podcast is preserved, and cultural references are not problematic. Nonetheless, some expressions feel out of place in Spanish, such as \"bienvenido en\" instead of \"bienvenido a\", and the closing line \"pronto para el próximo episodio\" is not idiomatic. These affect the natural adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key points from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the concept of grounding, temporary versus permanent knowledge, and the explanation of memory features. No major omissions are detected, and the explanation remains concise. Slight redundancies exist but do not undermine completeness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the main ideas and most technical content of the original French text, but it suffers from a number of grammatical, lexical, and stylistic errors that affect readability and naturalness. With some revision—particularly of idiomatic expressions, pronoun usage, and technical terms—the translation could reach a higher standard of fluency and accuracy. Overall, it is a competent but imperfect rendering that would benefit from careful copy‑editing and localization adjustments to fully align with native Spanish expectations for a podcast script about AI."
