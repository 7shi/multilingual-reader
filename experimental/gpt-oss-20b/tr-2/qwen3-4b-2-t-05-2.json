  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the same logical flow as the French original. However, the phrase *“apretar para un examen”* is confusing and would likely perplex native readers. This minor issue reduces overall readability.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences read smoothly and the translation avoids awkward word order. Nevertheless, some expressions such as *“apretar”* (to squeeze) are out of place, and a few verb forms (*“se envía”* instead of *“se envían”*) sound slightly unnatural. These quirks lower the fluency score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: *preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, anclaje*. The translation occasionally swaps *ajuste fino* for *afinamiento*, which is acceptable but inconsistent. The misuse of *“apretar”* for *“estudiar”* is a terminological slip. Overall terminology is solid.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the informal conversational tone and cultural references suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience. The problematic *“apretar para un examen”* stands out as a mis‑adaptation, but otherwise the content is culturally appropriate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No information from the original French script has been omitted. The translation covers every sentence and nuance, maintaining conciseness while preserving meaning.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the gist of the French original with good fidelity, though a few word choices—particularly the use of *apretar* where *estudiar* or *prepararse* would be expected—detract from clarity and naturalness. Aside from that, the text reads well, employs appropriate terminology, and preserves the original information without loss. A few minor edits would raise it to near-perfect quality, especially in the context‑specific phrasing around exam preparation and technical terms such as fine‑tuning. The translation is solid, functional, and largely free of omissions, making it suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience with minimal adjustment needed for flawless fluency and clarity.\n\nOverall score: 84 out of 100 (equivalent to 17/20 on a 20‑point scale)."
