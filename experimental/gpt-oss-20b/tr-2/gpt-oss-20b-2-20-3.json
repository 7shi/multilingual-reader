  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the sentences are logically structured. The speaker’s dialogue flows naturally and the explanations of concepts are clear, especially for a general audience. However, a few long sentences could be broken up for better pacing. Overall, readers will understand the content without confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker. Some minor awkward phrasings exist – e.g., “El ajuste fino, por otra parte, busca crear una competencia permanente” could be more concise – but overall the language is natural, with appropriate idiomatic expressions and correct punctuation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately rendered: “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “grounding”→“anclaje”, “memoria a corto plazo”, etc. The terminology is consistent throughout and suitable for the target audience. Minor style choice (e.g., keeping the abbreviation ICL) is acceptable.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast introduction and dialogue. Cultural nuances are handled appropriately, and the speaker names and conversational style are maintained. The adaptation is faithful to the source while being accessible to Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French original is present. No important details were omitted, and the translation does not introduce extraneous content. The structure and content remain concise and clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the content and tone of the original French text. Minor fluency tweaks could improve readability, but overall it is clear, accurate, and well‑adapted for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The translation scores an overall 18/20, reflecting its strong performance across all evaluation criteria."
