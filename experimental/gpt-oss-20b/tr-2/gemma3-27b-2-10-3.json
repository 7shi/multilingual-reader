  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to read. Sentences are logically structured and the dialogue format is preserved. Some phrases feel slightly clunky (e.g., “le proporcionamos la información que necesita para la tarea” could be smoother), but overall a native Spanish speaker can follow the conversation without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most of the text reads smoothly, there are a few grammatical slips and unnatural word choices. For instance, “se inserta automáticamente estos extractos” should be “se inserta automáticamente los extractos”; the word *prompt* is left in English inside the Spanish text, and “ajuste preciso” is not the most common term for fine‑tuning. These small issues prevent the text from sounding entirely natural.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely correct: \"entrenamiento previo\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\", \"anclaje\". However, \"ajuste preciso\" is less common than the standard \"ajuste fino\" and \"rango de contexto\" would be clearer as \"ventana de contexto\". Terminology is consistent within each section, but the choice of some words could be improved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the intent and humor of the original. Local expressions (e.g., “Tecno Flash” → “Tecnología al Instante”) are culturally appropriate. Minor inconsistencies in the show’s name appear, but they don’t affect comprehension. Overall, contextual adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue turns and key explanations are present. No substantive content is omitted. The Spanish version sometimes expands on explanations slightly (e.g., adding “en el momento en que empiece a hablarte”) but this does not introduce redundancy or errors.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and understandable, preserving the dialogue’s flow and key concepts. Minor fluency and terminology tweaks would bring it to a higher level, but as it stands it conveys the original meaning accurately and clearly for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
