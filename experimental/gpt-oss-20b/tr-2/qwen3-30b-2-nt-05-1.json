  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable to native speakers. Sentences are structured logically, and complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning are explained in a clear, step‑by‑step manner. Minor issues arise with occasional wordiness or a slightly formal tone in some exchanges, but overall the dialogue remains coherent and easy to follow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds fairly natural in Spanish, with appropriate vocabulary and a conversational register. However, a few phrases are slightly awkward, such as \"Ustedes han comprendido todo\" (which should be \"Lo has entendido todo\" or simply \"Lo entendiste\"), and some repetition like \"aprendizaje en contexto se llama aprendizaje en contexto\". The overall flow is smooth, but these small quirks reduce the fluency slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled mostly correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\" → \"refinamiento\", \"transfer learning\" → \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"context window\" → \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" is retained with a Spanish explanation. The translation of \"grounding\" as \"fundamentación\" is understandable, though \"anclaje\" might have been more precise. Consistency is good, and no essential terms are omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and conversational tone of the original French script are preserved. The Spanish version uses colloquial phrasing where appropriate and adapts expressions to fit Spanish idiomatic usage (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", \"documentos precisos\"). Minor cultural mismatches (e.g., the misuse of \"Ustedes\") do not significantly alter meaning, and the dialogue remains engaging for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, memory, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No key concepts are omitted, and redundancies are largely avoided. The translation keeps the content concise while retaining clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation of the French podcast script is of high quality, faithfully conveying the original content with clear explanations of technical concepts. Minor stylistic and lexical refinements could improve fluency, but overall the dialogue is readable, natural, and well‑adapted for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
