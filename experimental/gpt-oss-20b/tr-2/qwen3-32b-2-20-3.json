  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to understand, with clear explanations of complex concepts and logical sentence structure. Some long sentences and occasional awkward wording slightly reduce clarity, but overall the text remains readable.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for native Spanish speakers, but a few expressions feel a bit literal or stiff (e.g., \"la IA\" used in place of a more natural phrase, and the direct verb placement \"Lee\" for the AI). Modern, idiomatic choices could improve the flow.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje de transferencia\" and \"ventana de contexto\" are correctly rendered and consistently used. The translation preserves the nuance of the original and explains terms when necessary, making it suitable for a technically literate audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation effectively conveys the original intent and purpose. Cultural nuances are largely respected, though some phrasing could be more natural for a Spanish-speaking audience (e.g., avoiding overly literal constructions). Overall, it adapts well to the target context.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French text is present, with no omissions. The translation keeps the content concise while adding necessary clarifications, and redundancy is avoided.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid, accurately preserving the technical content and overall message of the original. Minor stylistic adjustments would enhance naturalness, but the work is clear, fluent enough, and well‑adapted to a Spanish‑speaking audience. A small polish would bring it to near‑perfect quality, but as it stands it is a strong translation suitable for most readers in the target language domain. Overall, it demonstrates a good command of both source and target languages with only minor room for improvement in fluency and stylistic refinement. 17/20 is a fair reflection of its quality, taking into account readability, fluency, terminology, contextual adaptation, and completeness.
