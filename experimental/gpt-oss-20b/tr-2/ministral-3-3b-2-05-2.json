  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, but the presence of editorial notes such as \"Alternativa más concisa\" and repeated commentary interrupts the flow. The core dialogue remains clear, but the interspersed guidance makes the text feel fragmented, reducing overall readability.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most sentences sound natural, there are several awkward constructions (e.g., \"El aprendizaje en contexto es como el memorizado rápido\"), inconsistent punctuation, and occasional literal translations that feel stilted. These issues lower the fluency, though the text remains comprehensible.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"in‑context learning (ICL)\", \"grounding\" (translated as *anclaje*). Some inconsistencies appear, such as switching between *ajuste fino* and *finetuning*, and the use of *informaciones* in the plural. Nonetheless, the terminology remains largely accurate and consistent for a lay audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to adapt to a Spanish-speaking audience by adding explanatory notes and simplifying concepts. However, the title change from \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Tecno Relámpago\" is not applied consistently (the original title reappears later). Cultural references are generally preserved, but the extra editorial comments dilute the intended tone of the podcast, slightly weakening contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points of the original are present. The added editorial guidance and paraphrases sometimes add information that was not in the source, but no critical content is omitted. The presence of repetitive lines and some missing nuance (e.g., the distinction between “memory” and “contextual learning” is slightly blurred) slightly reduces completeness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation communicates the main ideas and retains most of the technical terminology, but it is burdened by numerous editorial notes and some awkward phrasing that break the narrative flow. The translation would benefit from a cleaner, more streamlined version that removes meta-comments and refines the language for naturalness. With those adjustments, it would achieve higher marks across all criteria, particularly in readability and fluency."
