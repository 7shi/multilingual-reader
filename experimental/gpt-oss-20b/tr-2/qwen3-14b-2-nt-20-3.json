  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the main ideas and follows a logical flow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured, but a few long clauses make the text slightly harder to parse at first glance. Minor typographical inconsistencies (e.g., hyphenation of *pre‑entrenamiento* versus *preentrenamiento*) and the use of *en su* instead of *en tu* occasionally interrupt the rhythm. Overall, the text is readable for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most parts, using idiomatic Spanish for phrases like *enraizarse*, *memorizar* and *consultor brillante*. However, certain constructions—such as “El ajuste fino… ¿es ahí donde interviene el aprendizaje por transferencia?”—feel slightly stilted, and the switch between *ajuste fino* and *ajuste fino* can confuse readers. Punctuation and article usage are mostly correct, but the presence of a few awkward turns of phrase lowers the overall fluency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *ventana de contexto*, *grounding* as *fundamentación*. The consistency of terminology is good, although *fundamentación* is less common for *grounding* and could be replaced with *enraizamiento* or *anclaje*. Minor issues with hyphenation do not compromise understanding. Terminology is clear and appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original tone and intent, retaining the conversational style and the playful analogies. Cultural adaptation is generally effective, but some expressions—like *fundamentación* for *grounding*—are less familiar to native speakers. The translation could improve by choosing more common equivalents (e.g., *anclaje*). The overall context is faithfully conveyed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All sentences and concepts from the French original appear in the Spanish version, including the discussion of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and memory features. No substantive content is omitted, and no extraneous information is added. Slight redundancy due to repeated hyphenation does not detract from clarity.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely accurate, preserving meaning and structure, but it shows minor stylistic and consistency issues that slightly affect readability and fluency. The technical terminology is handled well, with only a few less common choices. Overall, it is a competent and clear translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience with a mild recommendation for polishing certain expressions."
