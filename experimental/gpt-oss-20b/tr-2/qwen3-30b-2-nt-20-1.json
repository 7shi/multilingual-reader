  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text contains many untranslated French fragments (e.g., “L'apprentissage par transfert est la clé” and long French sentences) and a missing line of dialogue. These omissions make the narrative hard to follow for a native Spanish speaker. The remaining sentences are simple and understandable, but the gaps and foreign-language insertions reduce overall readability to a low level.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most sentences are syntactically correct, the presence of French vocabulary and phrases interrupts the flow and makes the translation feel unnatural. Repeated use of the phrase “aprendizaje en contexto” and the odd placement of the acronym ICL also affect smoothness, resulting in a moderate score.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"anclaje\" are correctly rendered. However, several French expressions were left untranslated, and there is inconsistent use of the acronym ICL. Overall terminology handling is acceptable but not perfect.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the general tone and intent of the original, but cultural adaptation is limited. The repeated insertion of French terms and the lack of localization for idiomatic expressions (e.g., “bachoter”) reduce the adaptation quality. Score reflects decent but incomplete adaptation.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A noticeable line of dialogue is missing and numerous French passages remain untranslated, leading to significant information loss. The content is not fully complete and key explanations are omitted. Therefore, the completeness score is low.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation displays a solid grasp of many technical terms and keeps the basic conversational structure. However, the inclusion of untranslated French fragments, missing dialogue, and uneven adaptation severely hampers its overall quality. To improve, a complete review should be conducted to replace all French phrases with natural Spanish equivalents, ensure no dialogue lines are omitted, and adjust idiomatic expressions for the target audience. The resulting text would become more readable, fluent, and complete, providing a much better listening experience for Spanish speakers.\n\nOverall score: 7/20 (average of the five categories)."
