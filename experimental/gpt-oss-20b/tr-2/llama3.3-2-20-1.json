  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable for native readers, with clear explanations of complex concepts. Sentence structures are mostly logical, although some sentences feel slightly clunky (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto funciona con todo el historial de conversación en esta sesión como contexto”). Overall readability is good but could be improved with smoother phrasing in a few spots.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward expressions and grammatical slips (“la IA no ha perdido la información en el sentido que los humanos entienden; simplemente, su espacio de trabajo temporal se ha vaciado”). Vocabulary is appropriate, yet the flow could be polished, especially in the closing lines where the name change feels abrupt.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\". Consistency is maintained throughout, and necessary clarifications are provided. The translation could still benefit from slightly more explicit explanations for lay listeners, but overall terminology is well handled.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone, but some cultural adaptations are missing or unnecessary. For instance, the final paragraph’s suggestion to change the show’s name (“Tecnología Iluminadora”) is not present in the original and might confuse listeners. Adapting idioms and expressions could improve local resonance.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all information from the French source is preserved; the dialogue flow and key concepts remain intact. Minor omissions occur in the final remarks where the show’s name is altered, but no substantive content is lost. The translation remains concise without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and largely faithful to the original. It conveys the main ideas and technical details well, but a few awkward phrasings and a premature name change reduce overall polish. Refining flow and ensuring consistency with the original branding would elevate the quality to near‑perfect."
