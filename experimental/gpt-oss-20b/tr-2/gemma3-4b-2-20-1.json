    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the narrative flow mirrors the original dialogue. However, stray brackets, occasional missing punctuation and a few abrupt sentence starts slightly interrupt the flow, which reduces overall readability. 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation uses standard Spanish, but there are several instances of unnatural phrasing (“Usted ha entendido todo” instead of “Lo has entendido todo”, “Usted” vs “tú” inconsistency) and awkward word order (“En la nueva conversación”). The use of brackets and parentheses is inconsistent, and some colloquial terms (“bachoter”) are not adapted. These issues lower the fluency. 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje en contexto, memoria a corto plazo. The term grounding is rendered as anclaje, which is acceptable, though the definition could be clearer. Abbreviations (ICL) are preserved but not expanded. Overall, terminology is accurate and largely consistent. 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the overall intent and cultural tone, using a friendly podcast style appropriate for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor cultural mismatches (e.g., “Usted” vs. “tú”) and the omission of a brief explanation for grounding reduce the adaptation quality. 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major concepts from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory. Some small explanatory details are missing (e.g., the grounding explanation is not expanded). No significant content is omitted. 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the main ideas and keeps the dialogue structure intact, but suffers from some readability and fluency issues due to awkward phrasing, inconsistent pronoun usage, and formatting glitches. Terminology is largely correct, though the grounding concept could be clarified. The content remains complete, but the overall polish is below that of a professional, fully edited translation. A revision focusing on natural flow, consistent pronouns, and clearer explanations would raise the quality substantially. Overall, the translation is good but not flawless. The average score reflects this moderate quality, with room for improvement in fluency and contextual adaptation. The overall score is 16/20."
