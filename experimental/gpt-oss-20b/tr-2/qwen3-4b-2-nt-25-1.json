    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but several sentences contain awkward phrasing and occasional grammatical errors (e.g., *«Hola y bienvenido en»* instead of *«a»*, *«porque ya entiende…»* with a misplaced question mark). These minor issues do not prevent comprehension but slightly hinder flow. The overall structure follows the original, so the content is readable.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most sentences read smoothly, the translation exhibits occasional unnatural expressions (e.g., *«no enseñarías… antes de que se ataque a la mecánica cuántica»*, *«simplemente le proporcionarle»*). The mix of formal (usted) and informal (tu/su) forms also disrupts naturalness. Despite this, the majority of the text sounds conversational and appropriate for a podcast setting.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: *preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, In‑Context Learning (ICL)*. Minor inconsistencies appear (e.g., *«Aprendizaje en contexto»* repeated in the acronym description, *«fine‑tuning»* left in English). The terminology is understandable and consistent for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and humor, but some adaptations feel off. For instance, *«Usted ha entendido todo»* uses formal tone in a casual podcast, and *«anclaje»* is sometimes rendered as *«ancrage»* in parentheses, confusing readers. Cultural references are largely preserved, but the tone occasionally shifts.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No essential content is omitted. The dialogue remains faithful to the source, and all explanatory segments are present. Minor wording changes (e.g., *«es la potencia de este enfoque»* instead of *«c'est toute la puissance»*) do not affect meaning.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent overall and conveys the main ideas of the original French text. It demonstrates solid terminology usage and keeps the dialogue structure intact. However, it suffers from occasional grammatical slips, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent formality, which affect readability and fluency. With a few refinements—particularly in natural expression and consistency of tone—the translation could reach a higher standard of quality."
