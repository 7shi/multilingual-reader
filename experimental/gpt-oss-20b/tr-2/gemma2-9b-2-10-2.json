  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated dialogue is mostly understandable to Spanish‑speaking listeners, with clear explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning. Some sentences feel slightly awkward or repetitive, such as \"Lo has entendido todo\" and the duplicated phrase \"El aprendizaje en contexto se llama aprendizaje en contexto…\". Overall, readers can follow the conversation, but a few structural refinements would improve flow.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The prose is largely natural, but there are a handful of non‑native phrasings and inconsistent punctuation. The repetition of phrases and the occasional left‑over French word \"ancrage\" interrupt the rhythm. While the translation reads smoothly most of the time, these issues lower its native‑speaker friendliness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms such as \"pre-entrenado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly rendered. However, \"fine‑tuning\" as \"afinamiento\" is acceptable but less common than \"ajuste fino\", and the untranslated French \"ancrage\" breaks consistency. Terminology is generally appropriate but could be more uniform and fully localized.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The main context and intent are preserved, yet the show title shifts from \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Tecnología Flash\" midway, creating brand inconsistency. Cultural references are largely maintained, but the mismatch in the title and the use of French words in Spanish suggest a less polished adaptation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All core ideas and dialogue exchanges from the original are present; nothing critical is omitted. Some redundancy is introduced by repeated phrases, but no substantive content is missing. The translation keeps the material concise while maintaining the full message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version communicates the main concepts effectively and is largely understandable, but several linguistic and contextual hiccups—especially repeated phrasing, inconsistent terminology, and a title mismatch—detract from its overall polish. With a few editorial adjustments, the translation could reach a higher level of fluency and professionalism suitable for native audiences.\n\nOverall score: 14 out of 20 points."
