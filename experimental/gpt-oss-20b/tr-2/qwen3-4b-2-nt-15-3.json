  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, but several sentences suffer from awkward word order and missing articles that can impede smooth reading. For instance, \"Hola y bienvenido en «Tech Éclair»\" should use the preposition *a* instead of *en*. Some verb forms are incorrectly conjugated (e.g., \"El transfiere sus competencias\" instead of \"transfiere\"), which may confuse readers. Despite these issues, the main ideas are still clear, so the score is moderate.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation displays noticeable grammatical and syntactic errors that affect naturalness. Examples include mismatched articles, wrong verb conjugations, and occasional literal phrasing that feels stiff to a native speaker. Phrases such as \"El aprendizaje por transferencia es la clave\" are fine, but the overall flow feels choppy, lowering the fluency score.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", and \"memoria\" are appropriate. The translation keeps consistent terminology across the text. Minor issues include a missing accent on \"preentrenamiento\" and occasional literal translations that could be refined, but overall the terminology is correct and well applied.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator generally maintains the original intent, but cultural adaptation is limited. Some expressions feel too literal, such as \"Imaginen:\" or the direct use of the phrase \"El aprendizaje en contexto\" without contextual cues for Spanish audiences. Better idiomatic equivalents and cultural references would improve this dimension. Thus the score reflects adequate but not optimal adaptation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present in the Spanish version. The dialogue structure is preserved, and the explanatory content is retained. No significant omissions or additions appear, and redundancy is not overly problematic. Therefore, the translation scores high for completeness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core ideas of the original French text, but it suffers from several grammatical mistakes and unnatural phrasing that reduce readability and fluency. Terminology is handled correctly, and the information remains intact, but contextual adaptation could be improved to make the text feel more natural for Spanish listeners. Overall, the translation is serviceable but would benefit from a thorough copy‑edit and some cultural fine‑tuning to reach a professional level of polish. The final score reflects this balanced assessment, acknowledging the good preservation of meaning while highlighting areas for improvement in style and correctness. Overall score: 13.4 out of 20 (rounded to 13.5)."
