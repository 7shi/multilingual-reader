  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally easy to read and understand. Sentence structures are logical and the text flows well, making complex concepts clear. Minor issues arise with some long sentences and the occasional use of brackets, but overall the readability score is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for native Spanish speakers, but there are a few unnatural expressions. For example, the use of *prompt* and *instrucción* interchangeably, and the phrase “Aprendizaje en Contexto (ICL), o aprendizaje dentro del contexto” feels a bit clunky. Overall fluency is solid, with some minor awkwardness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are handled correctly: \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\". However, \"pre-capacitación\" is an uncommon choice for \"pre-entrenamiento\", and some English words like \"grounding\" and \"prompt\" remain untranslated. Terminology consistency could be improved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the informal, conversational tone suitable for a podcast audience and adapts idiomatic expressions appropriately. Cultural references are preserved and the overall intent of the original is conveyed, making the adaptation effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original information is preserved, but the untranslated term \"grounding\" and the omission of a brief explanation for \"ICL\" slightly reduce completeness. Additionally, some explanatory notes present in the French version are missing in the Spanish version. Overall, the translation is largely complete but could include those missing clarifications.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is clear, fluent, and largely faithful to the original. Minor adjustments to terminology consistency and a few missing explanatory details would raise the quality further. The translation effectively conveys the content’s intent while remaining accessible to a Spanish-speaking audience, making it a solid effort that could benefit from minor refinements to achieve a truly polished result."
