  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow, with clear sentence structure and logical flow. However, occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., \"pues que\" instead of \"pues que\", missing accents like \"preentrenamiento\") slightly reduces clarity. Overall, readers can understand the content without much effort.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker, but some expressions feel a bit literal or awkward, such as \"hoja de consulta\" for \"cheat sheet\" and \"Lo has comprendido todo\" instead of a more natural \"Lo has entendido todo.\" Minor grammatical inconsistencies also appear. Nevertheless, the overall tone remains natural.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje (grounding)\", \"memoria a corto plazo\". Consistency is good, and terms are suitable for a lay audience. Minor improvements could be made in explaining less common terms, but overall terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the cultural context and audience of Spanish speakers. Idiomatic expressions are mostly appropriate, though some could be polished for better local resonance. The adaptation preserves the original intent and purpose, with no cultural misinterpretations.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present in the Spanish version. No critical omissions are detected, and the translation retains the explanatory style. Redundancy is minimal, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the essence of the original French script with good readability and accurate terminology. Fluency issues are minor and can be refined with slight linguistic adjustments. Overall, the translation is of high quality and effectively conveys the intended message to Spanish-speaking listeners or readers. Minor edits would elevate it to near-perfect naturalness and polish, but it stands solidly as a competent and faithful rendition of the source text. The translation demonstrates a clear understanding of both the source material and the target audience, resulting in an engaging and coherent final product. Minor inconsistencies and literal phrasing reduce the overall score slightly, but the overall translation remains strong and effective. The overall score reflects a solid translation effort with room for minor improvement in style and naturalness. This makes the translation well-suited for its purpose, with a high level of fidelity and accessibility for Spanish-speaking audiences. Minor adjustments to wording and punctuation would bring the translation to an exemplary standard, but as it stands it is already very good and ready for use."
