  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable for a native reader, but the frequent lack of inverted punctuation (¿…?) and the occasional loss of article gender (e.g., “El ajuste fino…”) create moments of confusion. Some sentences are long and contain several clauses that could be split for better clarity. Overall, a reader can follow the gist, but the readability suffers from these structural and orthographic issues.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains numerous grammatical slips (e.g., “aplatar” instead of “aplastar”, “antiestación” instead of an appropriate term, missing accents on words like “Él” or “método”), awkward phrasing (“una cantidad mucho menor”), and inconsistent use of quotation marks. These errors interrupt the flow and make the text feel uneven. Naturalness is compromised by such mistakes, lowering fluency to the mid‑range.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, and *anclaje* are rendered correctly and consistently. Minor inaccuracies appear (e.g., “antiestación” is not a standard Spanish term for a cheat‑sheet). Overall, terminology is handled well, but a few mis‑translations reduce the precision.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation attempts to mirror the conversational style of the original and keeps cultural references intact. However, the misuse of punctuation and some word choices alter the tone slightly, making certain explanations feel forced or less idiomatic. The overall intent is preserved, but the adaptation quality is moderate.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present—pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, anchoring, and the discussion of memory features. No significant content was omitted, and the structure remains coherent. Minor semantic distortions (e.g., the “aplatar” slip) do not alter the meaning. Hence, completeness is high.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers the core message and preserves the structure of the original dialogue, but it is marred by repeated orthographic and grammatical errors that hinder readability and fluency. Terminology is largely accurate, and no substantive information is lost. With corrections to punctuation, word choice, and sentence flow, the translation could reach a high standard of quality for native Spanish readers.\n\nOverall score: 13/20 (average of the individual scores)."
