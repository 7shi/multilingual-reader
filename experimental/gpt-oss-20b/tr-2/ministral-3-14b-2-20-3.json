  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is fragmented in several places – many sentences are left unfinished or contain parenthetical remarks that break the flow (e.g., \"Suele percibirse a estas IA como cajas negras, pero su aprendizaje sigue un proceso real y tangible. (o alternativamente: *\"). These interruptions make it hard for a reader to follow the dialogue naturally. However, most core ideas are still present and generally understandable if the reader is willing to ignore the typographic quirks.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many awkward phrasings and literal adaptations that do not sound natural to a native Spanish speaker. Examples include \"engager un consultant brillant\" (unfinished), \"el proceso de preentrenamiento\" used twice in a row, and the inconsistent use of bold formatting. While the vocabulary itself is largely correct, the sentence structure and punctuation frequently break the natural flow of Spanish conversation.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are largely preserved: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL). Nevertheless, the translation sometimes adds unnecessary words or omits clarifying phrases (e.g., \"anclaje a la realidad\" vs. simply \"ancrage\"). The consistency of terminology across the entire text is uneven, which could confuse a reader new to the field.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent of the original (explain pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL, memory) is maintained, but many contextual cues are lost due to incomplete sentences and awkward phrasing. Cultural adaptation is minimal – some idioms (“como montar en bicicleta”) are appropriate, but the dialogue often reads like a raw machine translation rather than a polished Spanish script.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are omitted or truncated (e.g., the parenthetical remarks, the unfinished line \"engager un consultant brillant\", and missing transitions between speakers). As a result, important nuances – such as the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge – are not fully conveyed, leading to gaps in the reader’s understanding.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the basic meaning of the original French dialogue but suffers from a range of issues that reduce its overall quality. Fragmented sentences, awkward phrasing, inconsistent terminology, and omissions of key information make the text difficult to read and understand fluently. It would benefit from a thorough edit to restore natural flow, complete missing sections, and standardise technical terms throughout. While it is a usable draft, it falls short of the standards expected for a professional Spanish-language podcast script.\n\nOverall score: 11.6/20 (rounded to 12/20)."
