  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version follows a clear, logical progression that mirrors the original dialogue. Sentences are generally short and straightforward, making the technical concepts accessible to a general audience. However, some explanations—especially those about the distinction between in‑context learning and fine‑tuning—are slightly compressed, which may require a second read for non‑technical listeners. Nonetheless, overall comprehensibility is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Idiomatic expressions such as *“se le ha proporcionado un resumen rápido”* are fluent, and the use of *“conocimiento”*, *“memoria”*, and *“ajuste fino”* fits contemporary usage. Minor awkwardness appears in *“se le ha proporcionado un resumen rápido justo antes de que comience a hablarte”*—the phrase could be smoother, but it is not jarring. Overall, the text feels conversational and polished.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)*. The Spanish equivalents are accurate and consistent. The abbreviation ICL is rendered as *AIC*, which could cause confusion for Spanish readers; the original abbreviation *ICL* (In‑Context Learning) might have been kept. Explanations are provided for most terms. Overall, terminology handling is solid, with a small inconsistency in abbreviation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue is adapted well to a Spanish‑speaking context. Cultural references remain neutral and suitable for a broad audience. The translation keeps the original conversational tone and uses colloquial phrasing (*“se le ha proporcionado un resumen rápido”*). There is no loss of intent or meaning, and the script stays engaging. Minor improvements could involve more natural phrasing of *“se le ha proporcionado un resumen rápido justo antes de que comience a hablarte”* to avoid literalness, but overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory systems, and the analogy of a temporary vs. permanent consultant. No essential information is omitted. Minor redundancies (e.g., repetition of *“la IA no ha olvidado”*) are kept in the dialogue for emphasis. The translation remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the original dialogue’s structure, intent, and technical content. Minor issues include a slightly awkward phrasing and a possible abbreviation mismatch. Nevertheless, the text is readable, fluent, and well‑adapted for Spanish‑speaking listeners, making it a strong, professional translation suitable for broadcast or podcast scripts. Overall, it meets the expectations for a polished, audience‑friendly translation."
