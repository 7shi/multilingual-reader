  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically structured and complex concepts are explained in an understandable way. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., \"se afinada\") may momentarily distract a native reader, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds largely natural; however, there are several awkward or incorrect expressions such as \"se afinada\", \"se tienen la impresión\" (should be \"se tiene la impresión\"), and the use of \"Tech Luminosa\" instead of keeping the original name. These errors reduce the smoothness of the text for native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", \"memoria\". Minor inconsistencies include the capitalization of \"Memoria\" and the occasional use of the English word \"prompt\". Overall, terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally respects the original intent, but the show’s name is inconsistently rendered (\"Tech Luminosa\" at the start vs. \"Tech Éclair\" at the end). Some cultural nuances could be better aligned, and a few phrases feel slightly literal rather than idiomatic. This weakens contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are retained. No significant content is omitted, and the dialogue flow remains intact. Some small details, such as the exact phrasing of the closing line, are slightly altered but not omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is understandable and largely faithful to the original, but it contains several grammatical errors and inconsistencies that affect fluency and contextual accuracy. Correcting the tense mistakes, standardizing the show’s name, and smoothing some awkward phrasings would raise the quality to a near‑native level. It serves well for a general audience, though native professionals might notice the minor flaws."
