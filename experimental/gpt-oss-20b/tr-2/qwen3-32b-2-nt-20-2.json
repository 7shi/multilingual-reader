  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely clear and easy to follow. Sentences are properly structured, and the dialogue flow matches the original. However, some expressions such as \"se lee una cantidad muy grande de datos\" feel slightly literal and could be phrased more naturally as \"se lee una gran cantidad de datos\". Overall, readers can understand the content without confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly for native Spanish speakers. The dialogue tone is preserved, and the vocabulary is appropriate. Minor awkwardness appears in a few phrases: \"la IA no ha «olvidado» en el sentido humano del término\" could be simplified to \"la IA no ha olvidado en el sentido humano del término\". No major grammatical errors, but a few small refinements would improve naturalness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly translated and consistent throughout the script: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\". The terms align with common Spanish usage in AI literature. Explanations are present where necessary, maintaining clarity for a general audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the conversational, informal style of the podcast and respects the target audience's cultural context. Phrases such as \"¡Exactamente!\" and \"¡Una analogía perfecta!\" resonate well. Slight adjustments could be made (e.g., using \"bienvenido\" instead of \"bienvenido a\") but overall adaptation is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present in the Spanish version: pretraining, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the comparison of temporary versus permanent knowledge. No important information is omitted, and redundancies are minimal.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation delivers a faithful and readable rendition of the original French script. It captures the dialogue's tone, technical explanations, and cultural nuances with high fidelity. Minor stylistic adjustments would enhance naturalness, but the current version is already suitable for native Spanish speakers in a podcast context. Overall quality is excellent and ready for publication with just a few polishing touches. 94/100 points overall (average 18/20)."
