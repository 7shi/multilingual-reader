  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to read and follows a logical sentence structure.  Most sentences are clear and concise, with proper punctuation.  A few longer sentences could be split for better flow, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural to a native Spanish speaker.  Minor awkward phrasings such as \"se le dio un resumen justo antes de que empezara a hablarte\" could be improved, but they do not impede understanding.  The overall rhythm of the dialogue is smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", \"Memoria\", and the retained English terms \"prompt\" and \"ICL\" are appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone.  Cultural references (e.g., comparing to a university graduate) are adapted appropriately for Spanish-speaking audiences.  No meaning was lost or distorted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the original French is present; no essential information is omitted, and there is no unnecessary repetition.  The translation remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality: it is readable, fluent, and technically accurate, with only minor stylistic refinements needed.  It faithfully conveys the original intent while remaining accessible to Spanish-speaking listeners."
