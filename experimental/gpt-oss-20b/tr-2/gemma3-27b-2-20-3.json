  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall very readable. Sentences are well‑structured, the flow mirrors the original French dialogue, and technical concepts are explained in plain language. The only minor issue is that a few long sentences could be broken for extra clarity, but this does not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural to a native Spanish speaker in most places. There are a few slightly awkward choices – for example, \"fundamentación\" for \"grounding\" is not the most common translation and \"Aprendizaje en Contexto (AIC)\" introduces an unexplained abbreviation. Other than those, the vocabulary is contemporary and the phrasing is smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste preciso\" and \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" are correctly rendered. The use of \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\" for ICL is appropriate, though the added abbreviation \"AIC\" may confuse readers. \"Fundamentación\" for \"grounding\" is understandable but less idiomatic. Overall, terminology is handled consistently and accurately.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone, adapting idioms and cultural references for Spanish listeners. The title change to \"Tecno Destello\" preserves the playful nature of the original \"Tech Éclair\", and the conversational style suits a podcast audience. No cultural misalignments are evident.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present. No key points were omitted or added unnecessarily. The dialogue remains complete and coherent throughout the episode.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality: clear, fluent, and technically accurate, with only minor adjustments needed for idiomatic phrasing. It faithfully preserves the original content and tone while making it accessible to Spanish‑speaking listeners. A slight polish on terminology consistency would elevate it to perfection."
