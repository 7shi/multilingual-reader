  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version uses clear sentence structures that a native reader can follow easily. Complex ideas such as pre‑training and in‑context learning are explained in a straightforward way. Minor issues appear only in very long sentences that could be broken up for better flow, but overall readability is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for Spanish speakers, with appropriate verb forms and idiomatic expressions. Occasional repetitions (e.g., ‘aprende’ twice in quick succession) slightly interrupt the rhythm, but no major grammatical errors or unnatural phrasing are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are rendered correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\". The expansion of ICL to \"Aprendizaje en Contexto (AIC)\" is understandable, though the original abbreviation could have been kept. Overall consistency is good.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the informal, conversational tone of the podcast while adapting cultural references appropriately. The use of “consultor brillante” and the explanation of memory as a temporary cheat sheet fit well with Spanish-speaking audiences. No awkward cultural references remain.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present, including the distinction between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning, the role of grounding, and the discussion of memory features. No significant omissions or unnecessary additions are noted.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, effectively conveying the original content with accurate terminology, natural flow, and clear explanations. Minor adjustments could improve sentence rhythm, but the translation serves its purpose well for native Spanish speakers."
