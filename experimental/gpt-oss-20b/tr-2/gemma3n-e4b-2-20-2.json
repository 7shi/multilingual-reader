  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely easy to read and follows a logical sequence. Most sentences are clear, and the dialogue format helps maintain flow. Minor issues arise with the mistranslated term ‘atracción’ and the occasional repetition of ‘automáticamente’, but these do not severely hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the Spanish is fluent and natural. However, some awkward constructions appear: the word *atracción* is a mistranslation of ‘grounding’, the phrase *de forma automática* is repeated, and the mix of *tus* and *vuestras* shows inconsistency. Despite these, native readers would find the text understandable and mostly smooth.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely accurate: *pre-entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto* are correctly rendered. The main problem is the incorrect translation of ‘grounding’ as *atracción*, which could confuse readers. Other terminology is consistent and appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original content well for a Spanish-speaking audience, preserving the podcast format and friendly tone. Cultural references are minimal, so no major issues arise. The adaptation could improve by correcting the misused term and slightly smoothing some phrasing, but overall intent and purpose are maintained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the final conclusion. No significant omissions were found. The addition of minor clarifications (e.g., describing *prompt* in italics) does not affect completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and conveys the essential ideas of the original French script. It reads smoothly for a Spanish audience, with some minor linguistic slips and a notable mistranslation of a technical term. With a few corrections, it could be considered high‑quality for professional or academic use in Spanish-speaking contexts. Overall, the translation is solid but not flawless, meriting a high score around 18/20.\n\nScore: 18/20"
