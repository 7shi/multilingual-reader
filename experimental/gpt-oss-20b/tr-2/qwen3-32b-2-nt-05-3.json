  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to understand and follows a logical sentence structure. Long sentences occasionally reduce readability, but overall the content is clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds mostly natural for a Spanish-speaking audience. A few phrases feel slightly awkward or literal (e.g., \"la IA no se refina constantemente a través de sus conversaciones\" or the use of quotes around \"olvidado\"). Vocabulary is appropriate but could be smoother in places.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL), and \"anclaje\" are correctly used and consistently applied. Minor nuance could be refined, but overall terminology is correct for a general Spanish audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the original tone and intent. Some cultural adaptations could be stronger (e.g., keeping the brand name consistent or tailoring idioms). The title is translated to \"Tecnología Clara\" but later reverted to \"Tech Éclair,\" creating a small inconsistency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are present. No significant omissions or added errors. Some redundancies are avoided, and explanations remain concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the original content well, with clear and mostly natural prose. Minor issues with phrasing, consistency, and occasional awkwardness detract from perfect fluency, but the overall quality is high and suitable for a general audience. A few adjustments to improve natural flow and consistency would bring it to an excellent standard."
