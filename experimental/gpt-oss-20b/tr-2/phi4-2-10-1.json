  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable. The overall sentence flow follows the original structure, and the technical concepts are explained in a way that most Spanish‑speaking listeners would grasp. Minor issues arise from a few awkwardly long sentences and the omission of an accent in “¿Porque…”. These do not severely hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker, but there are a handful of unnatural expressions: e.g., “Ya lo has entendido todo” and “se puede decir eso”. Some phrases such as “se le ha proporcionado una fuente rápida de referencia” sound a bit mechanical. The vocabulary is contemporary and appropriate, yet a few word choices could be polished for greater naturalness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently and accurately: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto), anclaje. The translator kept the English term ‘grounding’ in parentheses, which is acceptable but could be fully translated to ‘fundamentación’ for consistency. Overall, terminology is appropriate and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, adapting idiomatic expressions to Spanish (e.g., “ventana de contexto”). Cultural references are neutral and suitable for a general Spanish audience. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve the localized feel, but no significant issues.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the additional explanation of context memory is retained. The translation remains concise while avoiding unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the core meaning and technical nuances of the original French script. It is largely readable and fluent, with only a few minor grammatical or stylistic slip‑ups that do not impede understanding. The terminology is well handled, and contextual adaptation is appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor polish would elevate the text to a near‑perfect level, but it is already suitable for publication or broadcast without major revisions. Overall, a strong translation that effectively conveys the original content to Spanish listeners."
