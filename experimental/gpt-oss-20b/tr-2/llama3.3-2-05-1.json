  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version retains the clear, conversational style of the original and presents complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL) in an accessible way. Sentence structures are logical and easy to follow, making it understandable for a general audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the text flows naturally for a Spanish speaker, but a few phrases feel slightly literal or awkward, e.g., ‘Entonces, ya lo entiende todo’, ‘Se puede tener una conversación larga’, and the use of ‘empollado’ and ‘empollar’ which are uncommon in Spanish. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., ‘una conocimiento’) reduce fluency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly translated (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, anclaje). However, the acronym ICL is misnamed as ‘Inteligencia Conversacional Limitada’ instead of ‘Aprendizaje en Contexto’ or retaining the English acronym, and the phrase ‘ventana de contexto’ is omitted. These inconsistencies lower the score.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., consulting analogy) and keeps the conversational tone. Minor inconsistencies in program title (‘Tecnología Iluminada’ vs ‘Iluminaciones tecnológicas’) are noted but do not significantly hinder understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are present. Small omissions include the explicit mention of the ‘ventana de contexto’ and the proper ICL name, but overall no key information is missing. Redundancy is minimal.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and largely faithful to the original. It preserves the conversational tone and explains complex AI concepts clearly, making it accessible to a broad audience. Some terminology inaccuracies and minor linguistic awkwardness slightly detract from the quality, but the overall message remains intact and comprehensible."
