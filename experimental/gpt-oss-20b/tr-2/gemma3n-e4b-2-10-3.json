  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows a logical sentence structure. However, some phrases (e.g., \"expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo de la IA\") are awkward and can obscure meaning. Overall, comprehension is possible but not as smooth as it could be.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural expressions and minor grammatical mistakes such as \"aplicar la 'aprendizaje por transferencia'\" instead of \"aplicación\" and mixing of Spanish and French words like \"¡Bonjour y bienvenida…\". While native speakers can follow the content, the flow feels choppy at times, reducing naturalness.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core terms like \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"grounding\" are correctly translated and consistent. The abbreviation \"ICL\" is used but not clearly defined in Spanish; instead \"ventana de contexto\" is introduced inconsistently. Overall technical terminology is adequate but could be more precise and consistently applied.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation occasionally retains French or English idioms (e.g., \"¡Bonjour y bienvenida\", \"In-Context Learning\" as ICL). Cultural adaptation to a Spanish audience is limited, with some phrases that feel forced or out of place. Better localization would improve reception.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most content from the original is preserved, with no major omissions. Some repetitions exist and a few explanatory clarifications are missing (e.g., the definition of ICL). The overall message remains intact, but conciseness could be improved by removing redundancies.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material but falls short in fluency and cultural adaptation. The technical terminology is mostly correct, yet the text would benefit from smoother language and clearer localization. With targeted edits, the translation could reach a high level of quality for a Spanish-speaking audience, but as it stands it is moderate quality with room for improvement. The overall score reflects these strengths and weaknesses, yielding a solid but not exceptional result. The translation is usable but not polished enough for a professional broadcast context without revisions. The average score across criteria is 13 out of 20, indicating that while the essential meaning is conveyed, there is significant room for refinement in naturalness, consistency, and cultural resonance. This assessment should guide a focused revision to elevate the translation to a near-flawless standard suitable for the target audience and medium."
