  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow for native readers. Sentences are logically structured, and complex ideas (e.g., pre‑training, fine‑tuning) are presented clearly. Minor long sentences may slightly reduce flow but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural and smooth. Vocabulary choices are contemporary, and grammar is largely correct. A few phrases (“Lo has entendido todo”) feel slightly literal, but they do not hinder readability.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are appropriately translated (“pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”). However, some terms such as “In‑Context Learning” and “grounding” remain in English, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the English terms.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent of the original podcast is preserved and cultural references are adapted for a Spanish-speaking audience. The translation maintains a conversational tone suitable for a podcast script. Some English terms could be localized for better cultural adaptation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present, including the distinctions between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and context‑based learning. No significant omissions, and the translation is concise while retaining clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is clear, fluent, and largely faithful to the original. Minor issues include the retention of some English technical terms and a few slightly literal expressions. Overall, the script would be well received by Spanish‑speaking listeners of a technology podcast, with a score of 86 out of 100 points. Improvements could focus on fully localizing all technical terms and smoothing a few phrasing choices to increase naturalness further. The translation effectively conveys the educational content and conversational style of the original French version while maintaining readability and coherence for the target audience. Good job overall, just a few tweaks needed for perfection."
