  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is partially readable, but it suffers from incomplete sentences and abrupt cut‑offs (e.g., fragments ending with \"or\" or missing continuations). The overall flow is disrupted, and readers must frequently infer missing information. The sentence structure is generally simple but the abrupt endings reduce comprehension, especially for complex ideas like pre‑training or in‑context learning.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several awkward or incorrect phrasing (e.g., \"en la pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendá francés rápidamente\", \"la memoria a corto plazo de la IA, o ‘ventana contextual’\"). There are also inconsistent uses of quotation marks and punctuation. While some sentences are natural, many feel stilted or literal, making the overall tone feel uneven and less smooth to a native speaker.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are generally present but sometimes lack precise translation or explanation. \"Pre‑entrenamiento\" and \"ajuste fino\" are acceptable, but the translation does not consistently use the French equivalents \"pré‑entraînement\" and \"fine‑tuning\". The acronym ICL is left unexplained, and the term \"grounding\" is translated but not contextualized. Overall terminology handling is adequate but not fully consistent or explanatory.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The opening greeting and closing are culturally appropriate, but the body of the translation does not fully adapt idiomatic expressions to Spanish-speaking audiences. Some literal translations (e.g., \"el ajuste fino es como enviar a este graduado a que siga una especialización\") read oddly. The adaptation lacks a cohesive tone and occasionally uses English loan‑words or mismatched phrasing. Contextual nuance is partially preserved but not fully optimized.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Significant omissions are evident: many lines from the original script are cut off or replaced with incomplete fragments (e.g., \"or\", \"or\" placeholders). Key explanations such as the mechanism of memory in chatbots and the distinction between temporary and permanent learning are truncated. The translation does not convey the full dialogue or essential points, leading to loss of information and clarity.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures some of the original dialogue but falls short in completeness, fluency, and clarity. It contains many unfinished sentences, awkward phrasing, and missing details, which detract from the overall quality. A thorough revision, including filling omitted content, refining terminology, and smoothing the flow, would be necessary to meet professional translation standards for this technical podcast transcript."
