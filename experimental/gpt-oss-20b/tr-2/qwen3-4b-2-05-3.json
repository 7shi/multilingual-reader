  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely easy to read for a Spanish speaker; sentences flow logically and the main ideas are clear. Minor issues such as the phrase *“Entendido todo”* and occasional clunky word choices make some parts feel slightly mechanical, but overall comprehension is good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds mostly natural, yet there are several awkward expressions: *“Entendido todo”*, *“se tiene la impresión”* instead of *“se le tiene la impresión”*, and the retention of the French word *antisèche* in quotes. These disrupt the smoothness for a native speaker, lowering the fluency score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre-entrenamiento* and *aprendizaje por transferencia* are correctly rendered. The choice to keep *fine-tuning* and *antisèche* untranslated is understandable but could be replaced by the Spanish equivalents *ajuste fino* and *cheat sheet* for consistency. Overall, terminology is handled adequately.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original's conversational tone and cultural references (e.g., the podcast context). Minor adjustments, such as rephrasing *“C’est une astuce?”* to *“¿Es una trampa?”*, would improve local resonance. The adaptation is effective but not flawless.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All substantive points from the French source are present; no major omissions. Some fine-grained details (like the precise explanation of how the memory feature works) are faithfully reproduced. The text remains concise and avoids unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version is a solid, mostly faithful translation that conveys the original content and tone. It excels in preserving information but would benefit from minor editorial polish to enhance naturalness and consistency in terminology. Addressing the few awkward phrases and replacing borrowed terms with their Spanish equivalents would raise the quality to near‑perfect."
