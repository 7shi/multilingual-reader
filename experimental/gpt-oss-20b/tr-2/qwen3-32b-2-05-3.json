  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally easy to follow and the logical flow of the dialogue is preserved. Sentences are not overly long and the key ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL) are explained in straightforward language. Minor issues appear in a few questions where the Spanish wording is slightly awkward (e.g., “Lo has entendido todo”), but overall readers can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but a few expressions feel slightly mechanical. Phrases such as “Lo has entendido todo” or “El aprendizaje en contexto es aprendizaje basado en la memorización” are grammatically correct but could be phrased more naturally. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary, and there are no glaring grammatical errors. The overall naturalness is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: pre‑training → preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning → ajuste fino, in‑context learning → aprendizaje en contexto, grounding → anclaje. Acronyms are preserved and explanations are provided when needed. The terminology matches common usage in Spanish technical and AI contexts.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone, adapting idiomatic expressions where appropriate. Cultural references are minimal, so no major adjustments were required. Minor style choices (e.g., “Lo has entendido todo” instead of “Has entendido todo”) slightly reduce cultural polish but do not alter meaning.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French transcript is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted. Minor issues include a missing accent on “¿Por qué?” and a slightly redundant phrase in the explanation of ICL, but these do not affect understanding. The text remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is strong overall, conveying the main ideas accurately and with generally smooth Spanish. Minor stylistic tweaks would improve fluency, but the current version is understandable, technically correct, and faithful to the source."
