    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely coherent and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and most complex concepts are explained in a straightforward manner. Some minor awkwardness (e.g. “una memoria a uso único” or “partes desde un contexto vacío”) slightly hampers smooth reading but does not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds generally natural for a native Spanish speaker. However, a few expressions feel literal or slightly awkward – such as “una memoria a uso único”, “partes desde un contexto vacío”, or the inconsistent use of “ventana de contexto” versus “context window” in the original. The vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, but the flow could be improved with smoother connectors.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afine”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “anclaje” for grounding, and the idea of a “memoria a corto plazo”. Terminology is consistent throughout, with no major mislabeling. Minor issues: “Memoria” is used in a generic sense instead of “funciones de memoria”, but this does not hinder understanding.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly preserves the original intent, but there is a noticeable inconsistency: the show’s title is changed from “Tech Éclair” to “Tecnología Flash” in the opening line while the closing line keeps the original title. This inconsistency could confuse listeners. Aside from that, cultural adaptation is adequate, though some expressions could be polished to match typical Spanish podcast phrasing.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, the memory feature, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. No essential content is omitted. Minor omissions: the ICL acronym is not mentioned, but that is not critical. Redundancies are minimal.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers the core content accurately and is largely readable for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Small stylistic tweaks and a correction of the inconsistent show title would elevate it to a near‑perfect level. Overall, it is a solid, comprehensible translation with room for fine‑tuning in flow and consistency."
