    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and follows a logical flow that mirrors the original French. Most sentences are straightforward, and the speaker labels help maintain structure. Some parts are slightly clunky (e.g., “imaginen que envías una nueva IA a la escuela” vs “en la escuela”), but overall a native reader can follow the dialogue without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly in most places, but a few phrases feel unnatural for Spanish speakers: “aprendizaje en contexto” is sometimes capitalised inconsistently, “la IA es como un joven graduado de la escuela” sounds slightly awkward, and the switch between “IA” and “inteligencia artificial” lacks consistency. Minor grammatical slips (missing accent on ‘preentrenamiento’) also detract slightly from the natural flow. Nonetheless, the overall tone is conversational and appropriate for a podcast transcript.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally well translated: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\". The Spanish equivalents are correct for the target audience. There is some inconsistency in capitalization of ICL and in the use of the phrase “aprendizaje en contexto” vs “Aprendizaje en Contexto”, but terminology itself is accurate and consistently applied. The translation also retains the parenthetical English terms where appropriate (fine‑tuning). No major mistranslations or missing jargon.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator kept the original intent and conversational style. Cultural references (like a school analogy) are appropriate for Spanish-speaking listeners. However, the dialogue sometimes feels slightly literal, and there is no explicit localisation of idioms (e.g., “bachotaje” instead of “estudiar de pasada”). Overall, the adaptation is effective but could benefit from a few more natural idiomatic touches.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present in the Spanish translation. No sentences are omitted, and the nuance around pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the concept of memory are all conveyed. The only minor omission is the exact phrasing of “ICL” which is rendered as “Aprendizaje en Contexto” without explicitly expanding the abbreviation; this does not impair understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and faithful to the source. It successfully preserves the dialogue structure, technical terms, and overall meaning. Some phrasing could be smoother, and a few consistency issues remain, but the translation is clear and functional for a native Spanish‑speaking audience. A few adjustments to natural expression and consistent terminology would bring it to a near‑perfect level."
