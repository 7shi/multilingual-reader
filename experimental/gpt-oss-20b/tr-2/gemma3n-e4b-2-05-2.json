  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically structured and the main ideas are conveyed without unnecessary complexity. Minor issues such as the occasional literal translation of “en esta ventana” instead of “en la ventana” do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for native Spanish speakers. Word choice is appropriate and most sentences flow smoothly. Some small awkwardness—e.g., the use of “vuestras” instead of “tus” in a singular context and a few slightly literal phrases—do not distract the reader.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently and correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL), and \"anclaje\" for grounding. The terminology matches what a Spanish‑speaking audience would expect.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The cultural adaptation is adequate. The opening greeting “¡Hola y bienvenida a ‘Tech Éclair’!” is natural, and the overall tone matches the original French podcast. No significant loss of meaning or cultural nuance occurs.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present. The translation does not omit any critical detail and keeps the dialogue concise while preserving the explanatory content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of high quality. It stays faithful to the original text, uses appropriate terminology, and reads smoothly for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve naturalness, but these do not significantly affect comprehension or accuracy. The translator has effectively conveyed both the technical content and the conversational tone of the podcast episode, making the Spanish version accessible and engaging for its target audience. The translation is suitable for professional or educational use and would serve well in a broadcast or podcast setting aimed at Spanish‑speaking listeners. Excellent job overall—just a few minor refinements could bring it to perfection. 18/20."
