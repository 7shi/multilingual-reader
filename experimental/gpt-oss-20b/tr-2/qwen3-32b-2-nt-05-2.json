  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely understandable for Spanish‑speaking readers. Sentences follow a logical order and the narrative flow mirrors the original. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., *El IA* instead of *La IA*) slightly disrupt clarity, but overall the text is readable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds fairly natural, but there are a few awkward constructions and grammatical errors. The repeated misuse of the article *El* before *IA* and the slightly stilted phrasing in some places (“El IA no aprende ni evoluciona”) reduce fluency. Nonetheless, the overall tone is conversational and appropriate for a podcast script.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre-entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto* and *ICL* are preserved accurately. Consistency is good, though the hyphenation of *pre-entrenamiento* could be standardized. The terminology matches the target audience’s level of understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator kept the intent and cultural context mostly intact. However, renaming the show to “Tecnología Clara” instead of keeping the original “Tech Éclair” introduces inconsistency, and some idiomatic nuances from the French version (e.g., *grounding*) were translated literally as *anclaje*, which is acceptable but could have been enriched. Overall, cultural adaptation is competent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the original are present. Minor omissions exist (e.g., the specific mention of the podcast’s French title is inconsistent, and a brief part of the explanation of *grounding* is slightly abridged), but the overall content remains complete and coherent without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the core message and technical content effectively, though it suffers from a handful of grammatical errors and inconsistent article usage. Terminology is handled well, and the narrative flow remains clear. A final proofread to correct article errors and unify stylistic choices would elevate the text to a near‑perfect level of fluency and accuracy. Overall, the translation is solid and useful for the intended audience, with room for polish in language precision and contextual consistency. The overall score is 18/20, reflecting a high-quality, mostly flawless translation that could benefit from minor refinements to reach excellence. The score of 18 comes from averaging the individual criteria scores, rounded to the nearest whole number. If a different scoring method is required, please let me know so I can adjust accordingly."
