  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally understandable, but several fragments (“El preentrenamiento.”) and abrupt paragraph breaks interrupt the flow. The narrative is clear enough for a Spanish speaker, but the sentence structure could be smoother, which reduces the readability score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most sentences read naturally, there are noticeable awkward expressions such as “El modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de tus discusiones” and the repeated standalone “El preentrenamiento.” These quirks detract from the overall smoothness and naturalness of the text.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding) are accurately rendered and used consistently. Minor deviations (e.g., “retroalimentación constante”) are acceptable. Overall terminology handling is strong.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone. Some culturally specific idioms could be improved (e.g., “se tiene la sensación de que” feels less natural). Overall, contextual adaptation is adequate but would benefit from more idiomatic phrasing.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the content from the French source is present. A few explanatory sentences were added that are not in the original, but no essential meaning is omitted. The translation keeps the dialogue largely intact while adding marginal detail.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the main ideas and technical content of the French script, but it suffers from fragmented sentences and occasional awkward phrasing that hinder readability and fluency. Terminology is handled well, and the core meaning is preserved, though some added explanations slightly shift the original focus. With a final editorial polish, the translation would be clear, natural, and fully faithful to the source text. The overall quality is functional but would benefit from refinement to reach a higher standard of smoothness and precision in expression. The overall score, averaging the five criteria, is 13.6/20, reflecting solid performance with room for improvement in flow and naturalness. "
