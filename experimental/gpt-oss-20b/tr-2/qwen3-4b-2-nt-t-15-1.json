    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable for native readers. However, some sentences are clunky (e.g., *«se envía una IA total a la escuela»* or *«se atacará a la mecánica»*), which can momentarily hinder the flow. The overall structure remains logical, and complex ideas are mostly expressed clearly, but the reading experience would improve with smoother phrasing.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures most of the content, yet several expressions feel forced or unnatural to a native Spanish speaker: *«Hola y bienvenido en»* instead of *«a»,* *«se envía una IA total a la escuela»* instead of *«una IA recién creada»*. Some literal borrowings (*grounding*) and inconsistent tense usage also break the natural flow. Despite these issues, the text reads smoothly enough for comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely correct: *preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL*. Minor inaccuracies exist (e.g., *«fin‑tuning»* is rendered as *«afinado»* which is acceptable but less common). Terminology is consistent and mostly appropriate for the target audience, and explanations are provided when needed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the original intent and conversational style. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is straightforward. Nevertheless, certain expressions could be more localized to Spanish-speaking audiences, and the use of the English word *grounding* might be replaced by *anclaje* for full coherence.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French text are present; no significant content was omitted. The translation provides adequate context and preserves the logical sequence. Minor omissions (e.g., *«grounding»* left as is) do not detract from overall comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful and intelligible, but it would benefit from polishing to enhance naturalness and eliminate a few awkward constructions. With some refinement, it would serve as a high‑quality, reader‑friendly rendition of the original podcast script."
