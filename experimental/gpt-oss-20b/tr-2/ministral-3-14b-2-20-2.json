  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation preserves the basic dialogue structure, but several sentences are incomplete or oddly phrased (e.g., \"engager un consultant brillant\" and abrupt cuts). Complex ideas such as in‑context learning are sometimes explained, but the explanations are fragmented and can confuse a reader. The overall flow is therefore understandable only with effort, so the readability score is moderate.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many parts read like a literal, word‑for‑word translation, with residual English terms (e.g., \"grounding\", \"In‑Context Learning\") and some grammatical slips. The text lacks the natural rhythm expected of a fluent Spanish podcast script, resulting in a fairly low fluency score.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" are correctly rendered. However, consistency issues arise: sometimes \"aprender en contexto\" is used instead of \"aprendizaje en contexto\", and \"grounding\" is partially untranslated. Overall, terminology is adequate but not consistently applied.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the conversational tone but mixes English and Spanish idioms, which can feel awkward for native Spanish listeners. Cultural references (e.g., changing \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Tecno Destello\") are not uniformly applied, and some expressions (like \"engager un consultant brillant\") are left untranslated. The adaptation quality is therefore average.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most core information from the original is present, but several segments are truncated or ambiguous. Some explanations (e.g., the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge) are less clear, and a few sentences are incomplete, leading to minor omissions in clarity. The translation is largely complete but could be more concise and explicit.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the general narrative and most technical details, but suffers from incomplete sentences, literal phrasing, and inconsistent terminology. It would benefit from a more natural rewrite, consistent use of Spanish technical terms, and smoother integration of cultural references. The current version is passable for a bilingual audience but would require editing for a native Spanish-speaking listener to fully appreciate the content in a natural, engaging podcast format."
