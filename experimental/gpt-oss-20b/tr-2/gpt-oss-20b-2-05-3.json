  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text follows a logical sentence structure and explains technical concepts in a way that is generally easy to understand. The use of conversational tone helps readability, though some longer sentences could be split for clarity. Overall, readers should grasp the main ideas without much difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly natural, but there are a few minor grammatical and syntactic slips (e.g., \"parten\" instead of \"parte\", awkward phrasing such as \"se hace posible gracias a la expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo\"). Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. A slight polish would improve smoothness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved with correct Spanish equivalents: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", \"ventana de contexto\". Consistency is maintained throughout. Explanations are included where necessary. Some terms could be slightly refined (e.g., \"ajuste fino\" vs. \"fine‑tuning\"), but overall terminology is accurate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and conveys the humor and conversational dynamics of the podcast. Cultural references are adapted appropriately for Spanish-speaking audiences, and idiomatic expressions fit local usage. Minor adjustments could enhance localization (e.g., using more idiomatic Spanish for certain jokes), but the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present. The Spanish version does not omit any substantive information, and it includes clarifications where needed. The text remains concise, with no unnecessary repetition, and stays faithful to the source.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the original content while maintaining readability and naturalness for Spanish-speaking audiences. Minor grammatical corrections and slight stylistic refinements would bring it to perfection, but it already serves its purpose effectively in a conversational podcast context. Overall score: 90/100 (45/50 after normalizing to 20-point scale)."
