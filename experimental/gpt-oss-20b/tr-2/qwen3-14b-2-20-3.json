  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely understandable, but several sentences have awkward phrasing or grammatical errors that can confuse readers (e.g., *Entienden todo* instead of a correct singular form, mixed tenses). The overall structure follows the original, so readers can follow the conversation, but a few adjustments would improve clarity.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural expressions and occasional direct French loan words that break the flow for native Spanish speakers (e.g., *bachotage*, *Entienden todo*). Word choice is generally appropriate, but a more natural phrasing would be needed in places such as *se le proporcionó solo una hoja de respuestas*.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are handled correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *sintonización* (or *afinación*), *grounding* → *anclaje*, *ICL*, *Memoria*. Consistency is good, though the alternation between *sintonización* and *afinación* could be standardized. No major mistranslations are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational tone and cultural references are preserved. The translation stays true to the original intent and addresses Spanish‑speaking listeners, but a few expressions could be further adapted for local idioms. Overall, the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All parts of the original dialogue are present; no significant information is omitted. Minor explanatory additions are appropriate, and redundancy is avoided. The translation maintains the content's completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is clear and largely faithful to the original French text. It conveys the same ideas and maintains the conversational style. However, several grammatical slips, unnatural phrasing, and a few lexical inaccuracies detract from its polish. With a careful proofreading and some natural‑language tweaks, the translation would achieve a higher level of fluency and readability while preserving its technical accuracy and contextual relevance."
