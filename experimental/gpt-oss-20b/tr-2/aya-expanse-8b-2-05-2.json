  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand for a native speaker, with clear explanations of complex concepts such as pre‑training and fine‑tuning. Sentences are mostly logical and the dialogue flow mimics the original. Some longer sentences could be split for even greater clarity, but overall readability is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation flows smoothly in most places. Minor awkwardness appears in phrases like \"Imaginen que enviamos una nueva inteligencia artificial (IA) a la escuela\" and the occasional misplacement of punctuation. The vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, though a few idiomatic expressions could be polished further. Fluency is solid but not perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"memoria a corto plazo\" are all accurate and consistently used. The translation also explains when necessary, keeping the terminology aligned with the target audience’s level of understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the intent and conversational tone of the original French script, adapting cultural references appropriately for Spanish‑speaking listeners. While some expressions could be more idiomatic, the overall contextual adaptation is effective and the dialogue feels natural in Spanish.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present, and the script’s structure is maintained. No essential information is omitted, and redundancies are avoided. The Spanish version provides a concise yet comprehensive rendering of the episode’s content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is strong overall, delivering clear explanations and maintaining the conversational flow of the original French. Minor fluency issues and occasional non‑idiomatic phrasing slightly reduce the polish, but the technical accuracy and completeness are excellent. With a few refinements, this would be a near‑perfect rendition for Spanish‑speaking audiences.\n\nScore: 17/20"
