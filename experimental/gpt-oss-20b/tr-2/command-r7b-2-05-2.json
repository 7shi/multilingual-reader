    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is somewhat understandable, but many sentences are fragmented or contain mixed‑language fragments (e.g., *el aprendizaje en contexto, es du bachotage*). The dialogue flow is disrupted by abrupt omissions and inserted translator notes, making it difficult for readers to follow the conversation smoothly. 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation frequently uses unnatural phrasing, awkward syntax, and occasional French words that were not translated (*bachotage*, *anti‑sèche*). Several verb forms are incorrect or over‑simplified, and punctuation is inconsistent. The overall feel is more of a literal dump than a natural spoken Spanish dialogue. 10/20.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste* (fine‑tuning), *aprendizaje por transferencia*, and *aprendizaje en contexto* are mostly present, but there is inconsistency (*ajuste* vs *afinar*) and missing explanations for concepts like *grounding*. Some terms are left untranslated or mistranslated (e.g., *apertamiento*). 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to fully adapt the original intent: extraneous translator comments break the context, and cultural nuances are not handled (e.g., the metaphor of a consultant is not adapted to a Spanish-speaking audience). The flow is interrupted by missing parts of the dialogue. 11/20.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several segments from the original are omitted or garbled (missing explanations, abrupt changes). Additional translator notes are inserted where they do not belong. The essential storyline is largely preserved but with gaps and redundancies that reduce clarity. 10/20.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation shows a basic grasp of the source text but is riddled with inaccuracies, mixed‑language fragments, and structural issues that hinder comprehension. The dialogue feels disjointed, and key technical terms lack consistency. Overall, the work requires significant revision to meet a professional standard for Spanish‑speaking audiences. 12/20 total score (average of criteria)."
