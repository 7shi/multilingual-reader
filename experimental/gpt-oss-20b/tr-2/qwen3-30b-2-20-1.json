  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly clear and easy to follow, especially for a general audience familiar with the terminology. Sentences are logically organized, and the dialogue flow is preserved. Minor structural quirks (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje”) slightly reduce readability, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most of the script, but a few expressions feel clunky or slightly archaic (e.g., “Se hace posible gracias a la expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo” and “El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje”). The use of “prompt” in English is acceptable in tech contexts, though some Spanish speakers might expect “entrada” or “prompt” as a loanword. Overall fluency is solid but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje. The terminology is consistent throughout the episode and aligns with common Spanish tech usage. Minor nuance losses (e.g., “prompt” retained in English) are acceptable for a general audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and informal, conversational style. Cultural references are adapted appropriately for Spanish listeners. However, some phrasing could be further localized (e.g., “del bachotaje” vs. “de estudio de último momento”) to resonate better with native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are preserved. No critical details were omitted, and the dialogue structure remains intact. Minor stylistic tweaks could streamline the text, but redundancy is minimal and content remains concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is generally high quality, faithfully conveying the original dialogue and technical concepts while maintaining a natural flow. Small linguistic and stylistic refinements would elevate it further, but it already serves its purpose effectively for a Spanish-speaking audience familiar with AI terminology. The overall accuracy and readability suggest a strong translation effort, though a native proofread could smooth out the few awkward phrasings noted above."
