  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly easy to read and follows a logical sentence structure. However, the inclusion of editorial comments and parenthetical notes (e.g., “(o *tan avanzados*)”, “Opción 1 (neutral/conversational)”) interrupts the flow and can confuse readers who are expecting a straightforward dialogue. Minor grammatical issues such as “informaciones” instead of “información” also slightly hinder clarity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally reads smoothly, but there are a few awkward or literal expressions: *fundamentación en datos* instead of the more common *anclaje* or *grounding*, *aprendizaje en contexto* (ICL) is fine, yet the phrase “aprendizaje de memoria” feels slightly clunky. Additionally, the use of brackets and explanatory parentheticals interrupts natural rhythm. Overall, the text feels native but with small stylistic flaws.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly correctly rendered: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *grounding* and *memoria*. The only notable deviation is *fundamentación en datos* for *grounding*, which is understandable but not the standard terminology. Terminology remains consistent throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator has kept the original sense and adapted expressions to a Spanish-speaking audience (e.g., *desvelar*, *capaces*). Cultural references (the name of the podcast) are preserved. Some word choices could be improved for a native feel, but overall the intent and purpose of the dialogue are conveyed accurately.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original dialogue and explanations are present. Minor omissions (e.g., the exact phrase “le cadre de contexte” is translated as “el contexto de la consulta”) are negligible. The added editorial comments, however, introduce slight redundancy and could be removed for conciseness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the main ideas and most technical details of the original French script. It is readable and understandable for a Spanish-speaking audience, but the presence of editorial notes and occasional literal phrasing detracts from the overall polish. With minor editing to remove the extraneous comments and tweak a few word choices, the translation would reach a near-perfect score."
