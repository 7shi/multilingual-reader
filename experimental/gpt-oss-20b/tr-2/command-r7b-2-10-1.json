    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the general flow of the original French dialogue. However, several sentences are overly long, some are awkwardly punctuated, and a few paragraphs contain repetitive phrasing that can hinder a smooth read. The explanation of technical concepts is present but occasionally buried in clunky sentence structures, which slightly reduces overall readability.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly natural for a Spanish speaker, but there are numerous instances of literal word choices that feel forced (e.g., \"se acuerda\" for \"se souvient\", \"la IA\" used inconsistently). Some phrases such as \"la IA no se afina constantemente con tus conversaciones\" sound odd. Word order errors and minor grammatical slips also detract from a fully fluent text. The overall voice is conversational but could be smoother.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core terms like *pré-entraînement*, *fine-tuning*, *apprentissage par transfert*, *apprentissage en contexte* and *grounding* are correctly translated to *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, and *anclaje*. Nevertheless, the usage is inconsistent in places: the word *grounding* appears in English within the Spanish text, and *anchoring* is translated as *ancoraje* but then *grounding* is used again. Some specialized terms (e.g., *window of context*) are rendered literally as \"ventana de contexto\", which is understandable but lacks nuance. The overall consistency of terminology could be improved.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue keeps the informal, conversational tone appropriate for a podcast script and adapts several cultural references appropriately. However, some idiomatic expressions are left too literal or are missing a natural Spanish equivalent (e.g., \"se acuerda\" instead of \"se recuerda\" or \"la IA no se afina constantemente\" which feels slightly unnatural). There is also a tendency to preserve some French phrasing directly, which slightly reduces cultural adaptation. Overall, the adaptation is acceptable but could be more refined.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the original French text are present: the explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the discussion of memory features. Minor nuances (e.g., the exact phrase \"le modèle lui‑même\" and the specific mention of \"mémoire à court terme\") are either paraphrased or omitted, but the translation still conveys the overall message. There are no significant omissions of content, though a few small details are less precise.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the core message and keeps the conversational style of the original podcast. However, it suffers from several awkward phrasings, inconsistent terminology, and occasional literal mistranslations that affect readability and naturalness. With some polishing—especially around technical terms and fluid sentence construction—the text could reach a higher quality standard suitable for native Spanish listeners of a technical podcast. Overall, the work is good but leaves room for improvement in fluency and precision of terminology and style. The translation is functional but not flawless, and would benefit from a final review focusing on natural Spanish expression and consistency of technical vocabulary. The overall score reflects a competent but imperfect translation. The total score out of 100 is 69/100."
