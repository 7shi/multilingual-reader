  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and follows the original’s structure. However, several gender mismatches (e.g., *las información*), awkward phrasings (*interpretamos la tecnología*), and occasional missing articles or prepositions make some sentences feel clunky. Nevertheless, the overall narrative flow remains clear enough for a Spanish-speaking audience to follow the technical concepts.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds conversational in places but contains a number of unnatural expressions and formality inconsistencies (mix of *tú* and *usted*). Punctuation issues (missing exclamation marks, misplaced commas) and literal translations (“bienvenido en”) reduce the smoothness. The overall tone is acceptable but not fully natural for native speakers.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto* and *grounding* are correctly rendered and consistently used. Minor issues include the literal rendering of *grounding* as *anclaje* without additional explanation and the occasional lack of explanatory paraphrasing for very specialized terms, but the terminology is largely accurate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to adapt idiomatic expressions, but some attempts are flawed: *bienvenido en* instead of *bienvenido a*, and the phrase *interpretamos la tecnología* does not convey the original meaning. Cultural nuance is generally preserved, yet the mix of formal and informal pronouns indicates a lack of consistent audience targeting.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all content from the original is present; the translation does not omit key ideas. A few minor details are slightly altered or redundant, but overall the information is intact. Small omissions like the missing exclamation mark do not materially affect understanding.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation preserves the core message and most technical details, but it suffers from several language inaccuracies and awkwardness that affect readability and fluency. Proofreading for gender agreement, article use, punctuation, and consistent formality would significantly improve the quality. The terminology handling is strong, and the information is largely complete, but the overall naturalness needs refinement to meet native‑level standards for a podcast script about AI concepts in Spanish.\n\nThe translation is serviceable but would benefit from a careful editorial pass to correct the highlighted issues and ensure a fully polished, audience‑friendly final product.\n\nOverall score: 15/20 (out of 20)."
