    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable. Sentences are mostly clear and follow the same logical flow as the original. However, some literal word‑for‑word choices (e.g., *«se envía una IA totalmente nueva a la escuela»*) can momentarily confuse readers. Overall, the content is comprehensible for a general audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several phrases feel slightly awkward or formal, such as *«se envía una IA totalmente nueva a la escuela»* or *«se le han dado una hoja de trucos»*. Word order and verb forms are occasionally clunky, but these do not severely impede understanding. Overall fluency is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: *pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding* (as *anclaje*). The terminology matches current usage in Spanish-speaking tech communities. There is no mistranslation or loss of meaning. Minor improvements could be made in terms of register (e.g., using *ajuste fino* instead of *ajuste fino* is already correct).",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation preserves the original tone and intent. The use of gender‑neutral *bienvenid@s* is a conscious stylistic choice that may not be typical for all Spanish audiences but aligns with inclusive language trends. Cultural references are kept literal (no unnecessary localization). Overall, the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present in the Spanish translation. No significant information is omitted, and the dialogue structure remains intact. Some small editorial differences (e.g., punctuation, minor phrasing) do not alter meaning. The translation is concise while retaining necessary details.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the original content while mostly maintaining naturalness and technical accuracy. The main weaknesses lie in occasional literal phrasing that could be refined for smoother readability. With minor editorial adjustments, this translation would meet professional standards for Spanish-language podcasts about technology. The overall score reflects a solid, well‑executed translation that could be polished further for absolute fluency. 17.4/20 (average).  The translation demonstrates a clear understanding of the source material, appropriate terminology use, and good contextual adaptation, making it suitable for its intended audience.  Minor refinements in phrasing and stylistic consistency would bring it to an exemplary level.  Overall, it is a strong translation that effectively communicates the original message to Spanish readers.  Overall Score: 17.4/20.  "
