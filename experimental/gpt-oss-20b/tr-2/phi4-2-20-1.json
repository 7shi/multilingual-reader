  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the overall narrative flow and makes complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning understandable for a general audience. Sentences are reasonably short and logical, although some compound sentences are long, which does not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly for native Spanish speakers. Minor issues appear in the abbreviation “AIC (Aprendizaje en Contexto)” which is unconventional and could confuse readers. Other than that, the vocabulary is contemporary and the sentence structure is natural.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately translated: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto. The consistent use of these terms aids comprehension. The only potential confusion is the use of AIC instead of ICL, but it does not obscure meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts expressions to Spanish-speaking listeners (e.g., \"consultor brillante\" instead of literal English). Cultural references are appropriate, and the content keeps the original’s conversational tone. No major contextual misalignments were detected.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present: the stages of learning, transfer learning, grounding, the nature of in‑context memory, and the explanation of new memory features. No essential information was omitted, and redundancy was avoided while maintaining clarity.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the technical content and the conversational tone of the original. Minor stylistic adjustments—especially regarding the abbreviation for in‑context learning—would bring it to perfection, but the current version is already suitable for a native Spanish-speaking audience interested in AI concepts. Overall, the translation achieves a solid balance between accuracy, readability, and fluency, earning an overall score of 18/20."
