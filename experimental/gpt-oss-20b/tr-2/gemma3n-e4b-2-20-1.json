  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely intelligible, but several sentences feel overly literal and long, which can momentarily confuse the reader. Phrases such as “La IA no ha ‘olvidado’ en el sentido humano del término; simplemente se ha vaciado su espacio de trabajo temporal” are clear, yet others like “Lo has entendido todo” read a bit awkwardly. The overall structure is logical, but the occasional clunky phrasing reduces readability slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds somewhat formal and often carries over French syntax, leading to unnatural expressions. Errors such as “atracción” for “grounding” and the accidental inclusion of the French phrase “du bachotage” break the flow. Word choices like “Lo has entendido todo” feel stilted. Consequently, the translation is understandable but lacks the smoothness expected from native Spanish prose.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto” and “In‑Context Learning” (ICL) are all present. However, the key concept “grounding” is mistranslated as “atracción”, and the English term ICL is left untranslated. These inconsistencies slightly undermine terminology accuracy.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally preserves the original intent and tone, and it adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., consulting analogy). Nevertheless, the persistent literalness of some French idioms and the occasional awkward phrasing reduce the overall contextual adaptation. The translator could improve by fully naturalizing expressions.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all content from the original is present, including dialogues and explanations. The main omission is the unintended retention of the French phrase “du bachotage” instead of a Spanish equivalent, which slightly distorts that segment. Aside from this, the translation remains comprehensive and concise.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version communicates the core ideas of the original French script and retains most technical terminology, but it falls short in fluency and precise terminology. The translation is largely intelligible and contains nearly all information, yet several literal French elements and mistranslations hinder readability and naturalness. With some refinements—especially in adapting idiomatic expressions and correcting terminology—the translation could reach a higher level of quality suitable for a native Spanish audience familiar with AI concepts. The current draft is functional but needs polishing to achieve a truly fluent and context‑appropriate result. 70/100 points total (approx. 35/50)."
