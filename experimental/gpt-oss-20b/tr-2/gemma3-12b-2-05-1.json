  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version uses mostly simple sentence structures and clearly explains complex concepts. Some sentences are a bit long (e.g., the explanation of ICL), but they remain coherent. Minor punctuation issues slightly hinder readability, yet overall the text is understandable for a general audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places. There are a few awkward phrasings such as \"separar\" (missing in the source but present in the target) and \"una solución\" for \"une astuce\". Overall, grammar is correct and vocabulary is contemporary, but a few expressions could be smoother.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled accurately: \"fine‑tuning\" → \"ajuste fino\", \"in‑context learning\" → \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"conexión a la realidad\" (though \"anclaje\" would be a closer match). The terminology is consistent throughout the text.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone while adjusting expressions for a Spanish-speaking audience. Cultural references are preserved, and the conversational style matches the original podcast format. The only minor issue is the translation of \"grounding\" which could have been rendered as \"anclaje\" for a more familiar expression.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French transcript are present in the Spanish version. The explanation of ICL, fine‑tuning, and memory features is complete, and there are no significant omissions. Slight redundancies were avoided, and the text remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely faithful and readable, with solid handling of technical vocabulary and contextual adaptation. Minor fluency tweaks and a more idiomatic choice for \"grounding\" would enhance the polish, but overall it meets the criteria of a high-quality translation. The score reflects a strong but not perfect translation, typical of a competent second‑language professional output with room for small stylistic improvements. 92/100 is a fair evaluation of the overall quality of the work presented here. The translator has successfully conveyed the original content while maintaining naturalness for Spanish listeners, ensuring clarity and completeness throughout the dialogue."
