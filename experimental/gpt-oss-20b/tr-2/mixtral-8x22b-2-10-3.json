  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text follows the structure of the original and is generally understandable, though a few sentences feel slightly awkward or have minor punctuation errors, which slightly lowers its clarity.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains some literal phrasing and occasional grammatical slips (e.g., \"¿Porque\" instead of \"¿Por qué?\"), making the prose feel less natural to a native Spanish reader.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are translated, but key terms such as \"grounding\" were left in French (ancrage) and \"fine-tuning\" was rendered as \"afinamiento\", which is acceptable but not fully consistent with common usage.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The show titles and cultural references were adapted to Spanish (e.g., TecnoRelámpago), keeping the original intent, though the final parenthetical note (“Tech Lightning”) introduces a small inconsistency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves almost all of the dialogue and information from the original; no major omissions are evident, though a few phrases could be streamlined for conciseness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version retains the conversational tone and most of the content from the French original, but it suffers from some terminology inconsistencies and minor grammatical errors. With a bit of polishing—particularly in translating key terms consistently and refining sentence flow—the translation would achieve a higher level of naturalness and precision. Overall, it is understandable and fairly accurate, but not yet flawless.\n\nOverall score: 16/20"
