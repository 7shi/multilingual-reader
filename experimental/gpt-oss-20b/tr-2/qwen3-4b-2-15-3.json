    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and the sentence structure follows the original fairly well. However, a few phrases are clunky (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto, es el ‘aprendizaje de último momento’”) and there are occasional mismatches between the French nuance and the Spanish wording, which slightly hampers smooth comprehension for a native speaker. Overall, readability is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly reads naturally but contains some awkward punctuation and word choice (e.g., the comma before “es” in “El aprendizaje en contexto, es…”; “El modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona…”). These small issues reduce the overall fluency. The dialogue format and conversational tone are preserved, which is positive.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, memoria. The terms are consistent and appropriate for a Spanish-speaking audience. Minor consistency in hyphenation (preentrenamiento vs pre‑entrenamiento) could be addressed, but overall terminology is accurate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent of the original podcast transcript is preserved. Cultural adaptation is minimal, but the translation could improve natural phrasing for Spanish listeners (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto es como…”). Nonetheless, the message is clearly conveyed and the dialogue style remains intact.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present. No significant omissions or additions that distort meaning. Minor editorial changes are present but do not affect the core information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the core concepts and conversational tone of the original. While it lacks a few touches of naturalness in phrasing and punctuation, it remains comprehensible and technically accurate for a Spanish-speaking audience. With minor refinements in fluency and contextual phrasing, it could reach an even higher standard."
