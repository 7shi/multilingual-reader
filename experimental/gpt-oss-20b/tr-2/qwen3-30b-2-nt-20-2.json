  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable, but several parts of the dialogue are missing or contain untranslated French fragments (e.g., *Telle est la réalité de l'ICL*). The sentence structure is mostly logical, yet the incomplete sections make it difficult for a native reader to follow the entire conversation smoothly. Therefore, I assign 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The majority of the text reads naturally and uses appropriate contemporary vocabulary. However, there are a few awkward constructions and question marks placed incorrectly, and some French phrases slip through, which disrupts the flow for a Spanish‑speaking audience. I give 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia* and *aprendizaje en contexto* are correctly rendered and consistently used. A few terms could have been elaborated further for a non‑technical audience, but overall the terminology is suitable. Score 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to adapt cultural references, but it fails to eliminate residual French expressions and does not fully consider the Spanish‑speaking audience’s idiomatic usage. Some culturally specific metaphors (e.g., consultant vs. permanent expert) are preserved but could be refined. I rate 10/20.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several lines from the original are omitted or left untranslated (notably the French fragments). As a result, the Spanish version lacks key information, which hinders full understanding. Therefore the completeness is low: 8/20.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation shows good knowledge of technical vocabulary and generally clear prose, but it suffers from incomplete coverage and leftover French phrases that compromise readability and accuracy. It needs revision to ensure all content is properly rendered and fully adapted for Spanish‑speaking listeners."
