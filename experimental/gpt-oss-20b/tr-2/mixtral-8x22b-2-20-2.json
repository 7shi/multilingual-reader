  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the core concepts are expressed clearly. Some sentences feel a bit literal (e.g. “Por lo tanto” repeated) but readers with basic Spanish can grasp the meaning without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most native speakers, though there are minor syntactic oddities such as “Usted ha entendido todo” and the lack of accent in “¿Por qué?”. The overall flow is smooth, but these small issues slightly detract from the seamlessness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are handled correctly (pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning). However, the French word “ancrage” was left untranslated, and the distinction between pre‑entrenamiento and afinamiento was mis‑interpreted (the Spanish “las habilidades aprendidas en el pre‑entrenamiento” misstates the original intent). Consistency and precision are slightly compromised.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the conversational tone and the purpose of the original script. Cultural references are minimal and do not need heavy adaptation. Minor idiomatic choices (e.g., “el sistema busca rápidamente”) could be smoother, but overall the context is well preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The content is largely complete, but a few nuances are lost: the specific reference to afinamiento’s permanence versus pre‑entrenamiento’s temporary nature, and the omission of the translation for “ancrage”. These affect the accuracy of the information conveyed, though the main storyline remains intact.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid overall, conveying the main ideas and conversational flow. Minor terminology lapses and a few wording inconsistencies slightly reduce the quality. For a professional or academic audience, a revision of the term “ancrage” and clarification of the pre‑entrenamiento vs afinamiento distinction would be advisable. Nonetheless, the translation is usable for general listeners and captures the spirit of the original French script well enough for casual consumption. The final rating reflects a competent but not flawless translation, suitable for broadcast with minor edits for precision and style. The overall score is 16 out of 20, balancing readability, fluency, terminology, contextual adaptation, and information completeness. If you have specific sections you want to refine further, let me know and I can suggest targeted revisions. Happy translating!  \n**Overall Score**: 16/20"
