    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to read and the logical flow of sentences follows the French source. However, some phrases such as “la información de que usted proporciona” feel slightly awkward and could be simplified to “la información que usted proporciona.” The use of “la cultura general” instead of “el conocimiento general” is understandable but not the most common expression. Overall, readability is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several minor grammatical slips (“El aprendizaje en contexto, es un bachotaje” – missing article and comma) and inconsistent article use (“una trampa?”). Phrases like “la ventana de contexto” and “una memoria a uso único” sound natural, but the repetition of “la información que usted proporciona” is redundant. The style is mostly conversational but occasionally stilted, which lowers fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely accurate: pre-entraînement → preentrenamiento, fine-tuning → afinamiento, ICL → aprendizaje en contexto, grounding → anclaje. Consistency is good, although the word “prompt” is left untranslated, which is acceptable. No major terminology errors, but slight stylistic issues (e.g., “la información de que usted proporciona”).",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and humor, using formal “usted” appropriately. Cultural adaptation is adequate: expressions like “una trampa” and “una memoria a uso único” fit a Spanish-speaking audience. The use of English terms like “window de contexto” is inconsistent (later corrected to “ventana de contexto”), slightly detracting from adaptation. Overall, it works well but could be smoother.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All main points from the French source are present: pre-training, fine-tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No key information is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary content. Minor redundancy (repeated “la información que usted proporciona”) is present but does not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the essence and humor of the original French text and is largely understandable. It exhibits a few grammatical and stylistic imperfections and some repetitive phrasing that slightly hinder fluency. Terminology handling is solid, and the overall message remains intact. With a few refinements, it could reach a higher level of polish and naturalness for a native Spanish audience. Overall, the translation is competent and serves its purpose well, but some fine-tuning would improve readability and fluency. The overall score reflects this balance between solid content translation and areas for improvement in style and consistency. The average score across criteria yields 16/20, indicating a good but not flawless translation quality."
