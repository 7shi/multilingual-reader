  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely comprehensible. Sentences are logically ordered, and complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL) are introduced with explanatory comments similar to the original. Some longer sentences could be split for maximum clarity, but overall readers can follow the discussion without confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker. Minor awkwardness appears in a few phrases: *\"se hace posible gracias a la expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo\"* could be *\"se hace posible gracias a la ampliación de la memoria a corto plazo\"*, and *\"se hace una búsqueda rápida entre tus intercambios previos\"* might sound more natural as *\"entre tus intercambios anteriores\"*. These are isolated issues that do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly translated and consistently used: *preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto), anclaje, memoria a corto plazo*. The translation keeps the English acronyms where appropriate (ICL) and explains them, which matches the level of the original audience. Some Spanish equivalents such as *ajuste fino* could be considered more standard, but *afinamiento* is acceptable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast format, names, and conversational tone. Cultural references are adapted appropriately (e.g., *consultor brillante* instead of literal translations). The Spanish version feels naturally localized while retaining the original intent, and there are no mistranslations of idiomatic expressions.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue and explanatory content from the French original is present. No significant omissions or additions were made. Redundancy is minimal, and the translation remains concise yet thorough. The only potential omission is the explicit mention of the word *\"grounding\"* as *\"anclaje\"*, which is correct but could have been highlighted more clearly; however, this does not affect overall completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation of the podcast script is high quality, preserving meaning, tone, and technical detail. Minor phrasing refinements would improve naturalness, but the text is ready for native speakers and effectively conveys the original content's intent and structure. Overall, a strong, accurate translation with only small areas for polish. 18/20 points overall. 18.0/20 as the final score. 18.0"
