  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation conveys the original meaning clearly and the overall sentence structure is logical. Minor issues arise with the placement of articles and a few run‑on sentences, but most readers can follow the dialogue without confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally in Spanish for the most part. However, there are occasional awkward constructions such as \"Ha captado la idea a la perfección\" and missing articles in phrases like \"se inserta automáticamente estos extractos\". Vocabulary is largely appropriate and contemporary, but some phrasing could be polished.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto. The translation of \"grounding\" as \"ancraje\" is acceptable but less common; \"enraizamiento\" might be clearer for a Spanish‑speaking audience. \"Memoria a largo plazo\" is a bit verbose but understandable. Overall consistency is maintained.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone. The program name change from \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Tech Luz\" keeps the literal meaning of \"light\", though it could be kept identical for brand consistency. Cultural references are adapted appropriately and the dialogue feels conversational.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original script are present. No significant content is omitted, and the dialogue remains comprehensive. Small article omissions do not affect overall understanding. The translation is concise yet thorough.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the original content with clear, mostly natural language. Minor grammatical adjustments and slightly more common terminology choices would further improve readability and fluency. Overall, it serves the target audience well and retains the conversational tone of the original podcast script, making it an effective localized version for Spanish speakers. The small deviations in phrasing and terminology are acceptable within the context of a spoken‑language translation and do not impede comprehension or enjoyment of the material. Excellent work overall, with just a few polish‑level tweaks needed for perfection. 94/100 points."
