  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are mostly short and structured in a logical order. However, a few sections use slightly awkward phrasing (e.g., “Es una observación excelente, y es esencial comprender su funcionamiento.”) which can momentarily distract a reader. Overall, comprehension is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds largely natural to a Spanish‑speaking audience, with appropriate verb tenses and idiomatic expressions. Minor issues such as the repetition of “¡Hola y bienvenidos” and the slightly formal “Les agradecemos su atención” slightly reduce flow. Vocabulary choice is contemporary and suitable for the target audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms like \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", and \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are correctly translated and consistently used throughout. The translation occasionally includes explanatory comments (e.g., explaining ICL), which aids understanding. No major mistranslations detected.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original tone and informal conversational style, matching the podcast format. Cultural references are appropriate, and there is a subtle adaptation of the podcast name to \"Tech Relámpago\" which fits Spanish naming conventions. The only potential mismatch is the final line referencing the original French title \"Tech Éclair\" instead of the adapted name, but this is a minor issue.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory features, and the analogy of a temporary consultant vs a permanent expert. No significant content is omitted, and the translation is concise yet complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation demonstrates a strong command of the target language, faithfully conveying the technical concepts and maintaining the conversational tone of the original French script. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve flow, but overall the translation is clear, accurate, and well‑adapted to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Score: 18/20 overall, with most criteria scoring 18 or above and information completeness at 19. The translation is excellent and requires only minor refinements for optimal naturalness."
