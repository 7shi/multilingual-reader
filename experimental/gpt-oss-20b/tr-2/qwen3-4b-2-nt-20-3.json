    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely understandable, with clear sentences and logical flow. However, there are a few small structural glitches (e.g., “Cuando usted afinan un modelo” instead of “Cuando afinas un modelo”) and a couple of phrases that feel slightly abrupt in Spanish. Overall, readers can grasp the content without major difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text generally reads smoothly, but several passages contain awkward or non‑native phrasing: mixed second‑person pronouns (“usted” vs. “tú”), literal translations such as “preentrenamiento” (which is acceptable) and a few grammatical slips (“la IA no se afinada” instead of “la IA no se afina”). The vocabulary is appropriate, but some sentences could be re‑phrased to sound more natural to native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding. The Spanish equivalents are standard. Minor inconsistencies appear in the verb form for fine‑tuning (“afinados” vs. “afina”), but overall terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the conversational tone and the podcast context. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation needs were modest. A few literal expressions (e.g., “aprenderá el francés a una velocidad asombrosa”) could be tweaked for more natural Spanish phrasing, but the overall intent and purpose remain clear.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the original French text are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the consultant analogy. No substantive omissions. Some redundancies were avoided, but minor details such as the exact phrasing of “La IA no se afinada” could be clarified.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and conveys the main concepts of the original podcast. It captures the conversational style and most technical terms accurately. Minor grammatical and stylistic issues slightly reduce fluency and readability, but they do not impede comprehension. With a few adjustments to pronoun usage, verb forms, and smoother phrasing, the text would read as polished native Spanish content. Overall, it is a solid translation that meets the requirements for clarity, technical accuracy, and cultural adaptation, but it could benefit from a final polish to reach a fully natural level of fluency and cohesion. The average score across the criteria is 17 out of 20, reflecting a strong but not perfect execution."
