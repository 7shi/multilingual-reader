    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish transcript is readable but is cluttered by numerous editorial notes, parenthetical explanations, and occasional sentence fragments (“La fase de pre‑entrenamiento.”).  While most sentences follow a logical order, the presence of many asides and incomplete clauses makes it harder for a casual listener to follow the dialogue smoothly.  It meets basic comprehensibility but lacks the polished flow expected of a finished podcast script.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural constructions (“imaginen que se inicializa un modelo de IA…”), awkward punctuation, and an overuse of English technical terms such as *fine‑tuning* and *in‑context learning* without a consistent Spanish equivalent.  Many sentences are too long or abruptly interrupted by parenthetical comments.  The overall sound is conversational but far from native‑like naturalness, which reduces fluency.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core terms like *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia* and *anclaje* are correctly rendered, and the translator attempts to explain nuances.  However, inconsistencies arise (e.g., alternating between *ajuste fino* and *fine‑tuning*), and some jargon is left untranslated (*ICL*).  The terminology is adequate for a technical audience but could be more consistent and concise.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator keeps the informal dialogue style of the original but frequently inserts explanatory notes and meta‑commentary that are not part of the podcast.  Cultural references are largely preserved, yet the added commentary sometimes obscures the original intent.  Adaptation is adequate but would benefit from removing editorial remarks and tightening the dialogue flow.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All of the original content is present, and the translator adds explanatory parenthetical notes that clarify technical points.  However, the abundance of notes creates redundancy and dilutes the main narrative.  The information is complete but not optimally concise; a cleaner version would improve clarity.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is a thorough but unfinished draft.  It captures the essential ideas and technical terms of the original French podcast, yet it suffers from an overabundance of editorial commentary, inconsistent terminology, and occasional awkward phrasing.  For a polished final version, the translator should remove the explanatory asides, streamline sentence structures, and standardize the technical vocabulary.  With these adjustments, the script would achieve a much higher level of readability, fluency, and professional quality, fully meeting the needs of a Spanish‑speaking audience in a technical podcast context.  The current state, however, remains useful as a foundation but requires significant editing before publication.\n\nOverall, the translation demonstrates solid understanding of the subject matter but falls short in producing a clean, native‑sounding final product.\n\nScore: 12/20 (average of the individual criteria)."
