    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely clear and follows a logical sentence structure. The speaker turns are easy to follow and the core ideas of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are expressed in plain language. Minor issues arise from the inserted definition of transfer learning, which adds an explanatory sentence not present in the original and slightly disrupts the flow.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the text reads naturally for a native Spanish speaker. There are a few slightly awkward phrasings – for example, the use of *perfeccionamiento* instead of the more common *ajuste fino*, and the sentence *Se puede decir eso* which feels a bit informal in this context. Nevertheless, grammar and vocabulary are mostly correct and contemporary.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are handled appropriately: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*. However, the inconsistent use of *perfeccionamiento* for fine‑tuning and the inserted definition of transfer learning introduce inconsistencies. The terminology is generally clear to the intended audience, but could be tightened.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references and expressions well, turning French idioms into idiomatic Spanish equivalents (e.g., *casi olvidar* to *la IA no tiene ni idea*). The overall intent of the podcast – to explain AI learning in an accessible way – is preserved. Minor wording choices could be smoothed, but cultural relevance is largely maintained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation covers most of the original content, but the inserted definition of transfer learning replaces the original question “¿Dónde interviene el aprendizaje por transferencia?” and slightly alters the flow. Additionally, a few short remarks from the French text (e.g., “Un vrai …”) are omitted. These omissions and additions affect completeness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely accurate and comprehensible, capturing the main ideas of the original French script. It is fluent for a native speaker, with only minor awkwardness in phrasing and some terminology inconsistencies. The most significant issue is the insertion of an explanatory definition that changes the original dialogue and the use of *perfeccionamiento* instead of *ajuste fino*. Overall, the translation is solid but would benefit from a quick cleanup of terminology and a review of the added definition to better match the source material’s intent and pacing. The translation is suitable for an audience familiar with AI concepts but may need a slight polish for a polished broadcast version.\n\nScore (average out of 20): 16.4"
