  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves most of the original meaning, but several sentences are awkwardly constructed or contain missing articles and punctuation. The overall flow is somewhat broken in places (e.g., “Las conocimientos”, “ant” instead of “antes”), which hampers easy comprehension. However, readers familiar with conversational Spanish can still follow the content, so a moderate score is justified.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text frequently uses informal pronouns (“tú”) and has several grammatical slips (“Las conocimientos”, “ant”), which makes it feel less polished. There are also minor word choice issues (“conocimientos” vs. “conocimientos”). These affect naturalness, lowering the fluency score.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as *pre-entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, and *aprendizaje en contexto* are generally correct and consistently used. However, some terms are translated in a slightly informal way (“anclaje” for *grounding*), and the translation of the phrase “anti-sèche” is missing. Overall, terminology handling is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the overall intent of the original and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., greeting style). Nonetheless, some cultural nuance is lost due to informal phrasing and the absence of certain explanatory asides that would aid a Spanish-speaking audience. Still, the adaptation is largely effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several sentences from the original are truncated or omitted (e.g., the explanation of ‘anclage’ is missing a key detail). The translation also repeats some points and occasionally introduces minor inaccuracies (e.g., mis‑capitalization). The main ideas are present but some finer details are lost, so the completeness score is moderate.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core ideas of the French transcript but suffers from multiple grammatical errors, informal phrasing, and some missing details. While readable for a Spanish-speaking audience, it would benefit from a thorough copy‑edit to improve clarity and polish. The overall quality is decent but not exceptional, reflecting a need for refinement before publication or broadcast usage. The score out of 20 is 14, reflecting a competent but improvable effort. The translation could be raised with careful attention to consistency, grammatical accuracy, and completeness of technical explanations."
