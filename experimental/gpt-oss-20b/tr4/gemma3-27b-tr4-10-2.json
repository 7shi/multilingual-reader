  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely clear and the sentence structure is logical. The dialogue flows naturally and the concepts are explained in a straightforward way. A few longer sentences could be broken up for easier reading, but overall the text is comprehensible to Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The language sounds mostly natural and smooth. There are a couple of slightly awkward choices such as the retention of the French word “ancrage” inside the Spanish text and the occasional use of the English word “prompt” without a Spanish equivalent. These do not significantly hinder understanding, but they do affect the overall fluency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered (e.g., \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\"). The inconsistent use of the French word \"ancrage\" instead of the Spanish \"anclaje\" is a minor error, and a few terms like \"grounding\" could have a more Spanish‑specific translation. The overall terminology is consistent and appropriate for a general audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and cultural context. Phrases are adapted to Spanish idiomatic expressions where appropriate, and the cultural references are suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor improvements could be made in a few colloquial expressions, but the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French text is present; there are no omissions. The translation does not add unnecessary repetition, and the content remains concise while still fully conveying the original message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is strong and largely faithful to the source. It effectively communicates the concepts and dialogue in a natural Spanish style, with only a few small issues—such as the mixing of French terminology and slightly uneven phrasing—that do not substantially detract from the overall quality. The result is a clear, fluent, and contextually appropriate Spanish version of the podcast transcript. Minor revisions could further polish the terminology and flow, but the current version is already of high quality and suitable for publication or broadcast to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Overall, a well‑executed translation with room for minor refinement."
