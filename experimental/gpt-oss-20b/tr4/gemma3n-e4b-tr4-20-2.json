  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the dialogue flow clear and mostly easy to follow, but a few grammatical errors (e.g., \"La IA hace de mismo\", missing accents) momentarily confuse the reader. Overall, the structure is logical and the content is understandable by a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences read naturally, yet some awkward constructions appear such as \"Mir\" instead of \"Miren\", \"La IA hace de mismo\" (incorrect) and occasional mismatched verb forms. These affect the smoothness of the text. Nonetheless, the overall tone is conversational and appropriate for a podcast transcript.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are largely correct: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", and \"memoria\". Minor slips occur with \"La IA hace de mismo\" (should be \"la IA hace lo mismo\") and a few untranslated English placeholders. Terminology consistency is good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent of the original French text is preserved and the translation is culturally appropriate for Spanish listeners. Minor wording could be polished (e.g., \"las leyes de la equilibrio\" → \"las leyes del equilibrio\"), but the overall context remains clear.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas and dialogues are present; no sections of the original are omitted. The only notable omission is the slight distortion of the phrase \"La IA hace de mismo\", which alters a key explanatory point. Otherwise the content is complete and concise.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation demonstrates solid comprehension of the original material and handles technical language well. It faithfully conveys the dialogue and key concepts, but a handful of grammatical slips and a mis‑translated phrase affect clarity and fluency. With minor corrections, it would be an excellent, listener‑friendly transcript."
