    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the logical flow of the original dialogue and presents technical concepts in a manner that is generally clear to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Long sentences are sometimes cumbersome, but the key ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, grounding, and memory) are conveyed without major confusion. Minor issues such as the phrase “se apoya en fundaciones extremadamente sólidas” slightly obscure readability, but overall the text is understandable.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly in many parts, but several expressions feel awkward or literal. Examples include “se apoya en fundaciones extremadamente sólidas”, “el aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje” (the comma and phrasing are unnatural), and “la IA no ha ‘olvidado’ en el sentido humano”. These choices disrupt the natural flow for native speakers, and some verb forms (e.g., “afinado” for fine‑tuning) are not the most idiomatic. The vocabulary is appropriate, but the overall cadence could be improved with more colloquial phrasing.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\" rendered as \"afinado\" (acceptable but could be \"ajuste fino\"), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\", and \"memoria\". Consistency is maintained throughout, and where necessary the translation offers brief explanatory context (e.g., explaining transfer learning with languages). Minor terminology could be more precise, but the overall accuracy is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation takes care to adapt expressions to Spanish usage, avoiding literal French phrasing and using familiar idioms such as “consultor temporal” or “consultor permanente”. Cultural adaptation is adequate; however, some expressions feel slightly formal or unnatural (e.g., “se apoya en fundaciones extremadamente sólidas”). The overall tone remains conversational and aligned with the original podcast style.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French script is present: the stages of training, the explanation of transfer learning, the concept of in‑context learning, grounding, memory, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No major content is omitted, and redundant details are not introduced. The translation stays concise while preserving the depth of explanation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and conveys the core ideas of the original French script. Terminology is largely correct and consistent, and the dialogue remains comprehensible. However, the text would benefit from a polish that smooths out a few awkward phrasings and improves naturalness for native speakers. With minor adjustments, the translation could reach a higher level of fluency while maintaining accuracy and clarity. Overall, it is a solid translation that could serve the intended audience with only slight refinements needed for optimal readability and naturalness."
