  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation keeps the original structure and uses clear, straightforward language. Complex concepts like pre‑training and fine‑tuning are explained in a way that is easy to follow. Minor awkwardness in a few places does not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the text reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker. Some literal constructions (e.g., \"la información que necesita para la tarea a realizar\") feel slightly mechanical, and a few prepositions could be refined, but these are minor and do not affect naturalness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL. Consistency is maintained throughout the script, and the terms are appropriate for a general audience. The only minor issue is the lack of a brief definition of ICL in Spanish, but the context clarifies it sufficiently.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references well, keeping the conversational tone and analogies (consultant, bike riding). The Spanish version respects local idiomatic expressions and keeps the original sense intact. Small stylistic adjustments could improve fluidity, but the intent is effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present. No essential information was omitted, and the translation remains concise. The inclusion of the ICL acronym with its English expansion helps clarify the concept for readers who may not be familiar with the term.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the original content while maintaining natural Spanish prose. Minor stylistic tweaks could enhance readability, but the current version is suitable for a general audience and preserves the technical nuance and conversational tone of the source text. Overall, it is an excellent translation that balances fidelity, clarity, and fluency."
