  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to understand for native speakers. The structure follows the original dialogue format and the flow of ideas is clear. Minor issues such as the use of “tienen todo claro” (instead of “tienes todo claro”) slightly disrupt the natural progression of sentences, but overall the reader can follow the content without major confusion.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences read smoothly and use appropriate vocabulary. However, some expressions feel awkward: “Tienen todo claro” is not idiomatic in this context, and “antiseña” (for a cheat sheet) is not commonly used in conversational Spanish. These small hiccups reduce the overall naturalness of the text.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: ‘preentrenamiento’, ‘afinamiento’, ‘ventana de contexto’, ‘in-context learning’ (transferred as ‘aprendizaje en contexto’), ‘grounding’ as ‘anclaje’, and ‘Memoria a corto plazo’ are all accurate and consistent. Explanations accompanying the terms are clear and adapted to a general audience. No major terminology errors are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects cultural and linguistic norms for Spanish speakers. The conversational tone is preserved, and expressions are adapted to local idioms where appropriate. The only noticeable adaptation issue is the misuse of “tienen todo claro” instead of the singular form, but this does not affect comprehension. Overall, the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French original is present. There are no omissions, and the additional clarifications or paraphrases are appropriate. The text maintains a concise style while ensuring that complex concepts are explained. Redundancy is minimal and does not detract from clarity.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material and conveys it accurately to a Spanish-speaking audience. While minor issues in fluency and a slightly off pronoun usage slightly lower the score, the overall quality remains high. The text is readable, technically accurate, and culturally adapted, making it suitable for general listeners of a technology podcast. Further polishing of a few colloquial phrases would bring the translation to an excellent standard."
