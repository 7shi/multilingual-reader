  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely clear and easy to follow. Sentences are simple and the narrative flow mirrors the original French script. The use of everyday language makes complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning understandable for a general audience. Minor issues arise only in a few long, compound sentences that could be broken up for additional clarity, but overall readability is very good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural to a native Spanish speaker. Phrases like “la IA no se afina constantemente con tus conversaciones” and “cuando abres una nueva ventana” are idiomatic and fluent. Some minor awkwardness appears in the literal translation of “fine‑tuning” to “afinamiento” (although acceptable) and in a few tense inconsistencies (“se puede decir eso” versus “se puede decir”). Nevertheless, the overall flow is smooth and the vocabulary is contemporary.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently and accurately rendered: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “In‑Context Learning (ICL)”, “grounding” → “anclaje”, “memoria” for the feature that auto‑recalls past exchanges. The translator provides context where needed, e.g., explaining that fine‑tuning modifies the model’s internal structure. No critical terms are omitted or mistranslated.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the podcast’s conversational tone and addresses listeners directly, mirroring the original French style. Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The adaptation is faithful and sometimes slightly improved (e.g., “Hola y bienvenidos” instead of a literal “Bonjour”). There are no misinterpretations of intent, and the target audience’s background is considered.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All segments of the original script are present. No key information was omitted, and redundancies were avoided. The translation even expands slightly to clarify certain points (e.g., explaining “la IA no se afina constantemente” vs. “el modelo en sí no aprende”). The content remains concise while preserving the original meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is high‑quality, faithfully conveying the original French content while maintaining natural flow and clarity. Minor refinements could improve readability and eliminate a few tense inconsistencies, but overall it is an excellent job of rendering complex technical concepts into accessible language for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
