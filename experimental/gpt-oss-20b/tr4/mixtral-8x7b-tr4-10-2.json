  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is largely comprehensible to Spanish speakers, with clear explanations of concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning. However, the presence of untranslated parenthetical comments (e.g., the literal French sentences inserted in brackets) and occasional missing or awkward punctuation disrupts the flow. These artefacts make some sections feel disjointed, lowering overall readability.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue uses mostly natural Spanish, but several sentences contain awkward phrasing, inconsistent capitalization, and remnants of English (e.g., “In‑Context Learning” retained in English, or the use of parentheses). Phrases like \"la forma en que la IA «recuerda» esta información\" feel clunky, and the mixing of English terms reduces the smoothness expected of native‑level text.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly translated correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"memoria a corto plazo\". Minor inconsistencies appear (e.g., alternating \"ajuste fino\" and \"afinamiento\") and the occasional retention of the English acronym ICL. Nonetheless, the terminology remains understandable for a general audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the brand name to \"Tech Claridad\" and uses culturally appropriate expressions. However, some original nuances are lost where the translation inserts explanatory asides not present in the source. The overall intent of the podcast is preserved, but a more faithful alignment with the French tone would improve adaptation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Essential content from the original is present: the discussion of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL and the memory feature. Nonetheless, some English sentences remain untranslated, and a few explanatory interjections are added that were not in the source. This results in mild redundancy and small omissions.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the core ideas of the original French podcast, but suffers from several artefacts—parenthetical French sentences, retained English terms, and awkward phrasing—that impede readability and fluency. Terminology is largely correct, and contextual adaptation is adequate, yet the overall quality would benefit from a more polished, fully Spanish rendition that removes stray comments and smooths sentence construction. The translation is understandable for a general audience but falls short of a professional, polished standard."
