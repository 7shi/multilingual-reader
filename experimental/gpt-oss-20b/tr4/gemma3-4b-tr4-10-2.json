  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is largely understandable for Spanish‑speaking readers.  The main sentences are short and the dialogue structure is preserved, which helps comprehension.  However, the repeated speaker tags (e.g., “Camille: Camille”) and occasional abrupt line breaks disrupt the flow and may confuse the reader.  Despite these formatting issues, the core ideas are conveyed and the overall readability is fairly high.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the vocabulary choices are mostly appropriate, the translation contains several unnatural expressions and grammatical errors.  Phrases such as “la IA no se está afinando constantemente por sus conversaciones” and the repetitive speaker labels give the text a mechanical feel.  Some sentences feel clipped or incorrectly punctuated, which hampers naturalness.  The overall fluency is acceptable but would benefit from smoothing and editing.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL), and \"anclaje\".  However, the translation sometimes omits the acronym explanations that appeared in the original (e.g., ICL) and does not consistently label the terms with their English equivalents, which can cause confusion for a bilingual audience.  The terminology is generally accurate but could be more consistent and annotated where needed.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the original intent and conversational tone, but there are a few cultural mismatches.  The brand name \"Tech Éclair\" is left unchanged, which is acceptable, but some idiomatic expressions (e.g., “un programa de formación de varios años”) could be more idiomatic in Spanish.  The text does not fully adapt some expressions to the target culture, and the duplicate speaker tags break the natural flow of a Spanish podcast script.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the information from the original French script is present, but there are noticeable omissions and redundancies.  Several speaker tags are duplicated, and a few short exchanges are missing or incomplete (e.g., the line “Camille: Es un tema fascinante…”).  The overall content is preserved, yet the repetition and missing elements slightly reduce the completeness and clarity of the translation.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the core ideas of the original French script and uses many correct technical terms.  However, the text suffers from formatting problems (duplicated speaker tags, abrupt line breaks) and some awkward phrasing that hinder readability and fluency.  With a few edits to remove repetition, improve sentence flow, and add missing brief dialogues, the translation could reach a higher quality level.  As it stands, it is functional but not polished for a professional podcast audience."
