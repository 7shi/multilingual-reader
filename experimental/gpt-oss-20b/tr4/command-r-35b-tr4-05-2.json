  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text preserves the dialogue structure and is largely clear to a native speaker. Sentences are mostly concise, though a few are long and slightly cumbersome, which reduces readability marginally. Overall, readers can follow the conversation without confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation flows reasonably well but contains a handful of awkward constructions (e.g., \"Aprendizaje In-Context\" instead of the more idiomatic \"Aprendizaje en contexto\"). Some literal word choices (e.g., \"chivatazo\") feel informal but understandable. Overall, the text sounds natural but could be smoothed out.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"memoria a corto plazo\", and \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are used correctly and consistently. Minor terminology inconsistencies exist (e.g., capitalizing \"In-Context\"), but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references well, retaining the conversational tone suitable for a podcast audience. Minor adjustments could improve cultural resonance (e.g., replacing \"chivatazo\" with a more neutral term), but overall the intent is preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French dialogue are present. The translation does not omit critical information and adds no extraneous content, maintaining conciseness while covering every segment of the conversation.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is strong, accurately conveying the original content with clear dialogue and appropriate technical language. Minor fluency tweaks and terminology polish would bring it to near-perfect quality, but as it stands it is a competent and largely faithful rendition suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
