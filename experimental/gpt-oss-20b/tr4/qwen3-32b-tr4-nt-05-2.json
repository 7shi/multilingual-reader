  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is easy to follow. Sentences are logically structured and complex ideas are expressed in a clear way. Some minor word‑choice issues (e.g., \"aprende francés\" missing the article) do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the text sounds natural for native Spanish speakers. A few phrases feel slightly literal or awkward – such as \"aprende francés a una velocidad increíble\" and \"se puede tener una conversación larga y detallada\" – but these do not create confusion. Grammar is correct and vocabulary is contemporary.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", \"memoria a corto plazo\". The abbreviation \"AIC\" instead of \"ICL\" is a small deviation but still understandable. Overall, terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone. Cultural adaptation is adequate – expressions are tailored to Spanish-speaking listeners, and the dialogue retains its conversational feel. Minor improvements could be made in aligning idioms (e.g., \"consultor temporal\" instead of \"consultor brillante\"), but no major issues.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present. No substantive content is omitted, and the Spanish version stays concise without unnecessary repetition. The translation includes the same examples and analogies, ensuring readers receive the full explanation.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It faithfully conveys the original content while maintaining clear, natural Spanish. Minor refinements in word choice and consistency could elevate it to perfect, but it already meets the expectations for a professional translation of this dialogue. Overall, it is well‑executed and accessible to Spanish‑speaking audiences. Good job!  Overall Score: 90/100."
