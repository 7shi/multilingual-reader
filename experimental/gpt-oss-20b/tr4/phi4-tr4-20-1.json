  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text follows the same dialogue structure as the original, using clear sentences that are generally easy to understand. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in a straightforward way. The only minor issue is occasional long sentences that could be broken up for even smoother reading.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural to a native Spanish speaker. However, some phrasing feels slightly literal or awkward, e.g., \"Aprendizaje In-Contextual\" and the use of parentheses for acronyms. Punctuation could be tightened in a few places. Overall, the text flows well but would benefit from a final polish.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, etc. The only noticeable mismatch is the abbreviation AIC for In‑Context Learning, which is not standard; a simple \"ICL\" or a Spanish equivalent would be clearer. Nonetheless, terminology is consistent and appropriate for the audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the cultural context of Spanish‑speaking listeners. Idiomatic expressions are used correctly, and the conversational tone matches the original. Minor adjustments (e.g., avoiding overly literal translations) would improve the adaptation, but it is already effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No essential detail is omitted, and the structure preserves the narrative flow. Redundancies are minimal, and the content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
