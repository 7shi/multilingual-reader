  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and easy to follow, with the main ideas conveyed in a straightforward manner. The use of analogies (e.g., the university graduate, the bike rider) is preserved, helping readers grasp the concepts. Some long sentences could be split for better pacing, but overall comprehension is good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary choices are appropriate, and the flow is smooth. Minor issues include a slightly awkward phrase in the sentence “Lo has entendido todo” (it feels redundant) and the use of “Lo olvida todo” instead of “Lo olvidará todo.” These do not significantly hinder understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately translated and consistently used: ‘pre‑entrenamiento’, ‘ajuste fino’, ‘aprendizaje por transferencia’, ‘ventana de contexto’, and ‘anclaje’. The term ‘ICL (In‑Context Learning)’ is left in its original English abbreviation, which is acceptable in technical contexts. Overall terminology handling is excellent.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The text adapts well to a Spanish-speaking audience, maintaining the conversational tone of the original. Cultural references are minimal, so the translation does not lose meaning. Slight adjustments could improve localization (e.g., replacing ‘consultor brillante’ with a more colloquial phrase), but the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No critical information is omitted, and the text remains concise without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and largely faithful to the original. It conveys complex ideas with clear analogies and maintains a conversational tone. Minor linguistic tweaks could polish the text further, but overall it meets the criteria for readability, fluency, terminology, contextual adaptation, and completeness. Good job balancing accuracy with natural flow for a Spanish-speaking audience."
