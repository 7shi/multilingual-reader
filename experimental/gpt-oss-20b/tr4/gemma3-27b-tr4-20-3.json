  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is mostly easy to read and follows a logical structure. Sentence length is manageable and the flow mirrors the original French dialogue. Some long sentences could be split for smoother reading, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural for native Spanish speakers. Minor awkwardness appears in a few phrases such as \"se trata de aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL\" (could be simplified) and occasional overuse of the passive \"se ha\". Vocabulary is contemporary and appropriate for a tech podcast.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\", \"memoria a corto plazo\". Explanations accompany terms when needed, and no mistranslations are evident.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the informal, conversational tone suitable for a podcast. Cultural references are minimal, but the script remains approachable for Spanish-speaking listeners. Some idiomatic adjustments could improve relatability (e.g., replacing \"cajas negras\" with \"cajas de la verdad\" might resonate more locally), yet the intent is well preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential content from the original French is present. No significant omissions or additions that alter meaning. The Spanish version stays concise and avoids unnecessary repetition, while retaining the narrative flow.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates solid proficiency in conveying the original French podcast script into Spanish. It maintains the key concepts, technical accuracy, and conversational style with only minor fluency tweaks needed. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
