  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally understandable and follows a logical sequence, but occasional typographical errors (e.g., \"ajuste fine\") and the inclusion of translator notes within the body of the translation can confuse readers. 16/20",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences flow naturally, but the repetition of speaker tags (\"Luc: Luc:\") and the literal use of \"ajuste fine\" instead of the correct Spanish \"ajuste fino\" create a slightly awkward feel. 15/20",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved correctly: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"in-context learning (ICL)\", \"memoria a corto plazo\". However, \"ajuste fine\" is a mistranslation and \"ancraje\" for \"grounding\" is acceptable but not the most common term. 15/20",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and uses appropriate cultural references (e.g., \"ventana\" for \"fenêtre\"). Some expressions could be smoother, and the literal carry‑over of certain idioms (e.g., \"bachotage\") is acceptable but not fully adapted. 16/20",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the source are present. The only loss is due to the inserted translator notes which slightly interrupt the flow but do not omit critical information. 17/20",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material and retains its technical essence. Nevertheless, it is marred by a few linguistic inaccuracies, redundant speaker tags, and embedded translator notes that detract from the overall polish. The core message is clear, but the text would benefit from a final cleanup to remove extraneous annotations and correct minor terminology errors before publication. Overall, it is a competent translation that would serve most general‑audience listeners, with some room for refinement to reach a professional standard. 16/20"
