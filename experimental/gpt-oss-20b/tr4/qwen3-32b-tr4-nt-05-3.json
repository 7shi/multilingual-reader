  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely understandable and the dialogue follows a logical structure.  However, some minor phrasing issues (e.g., “aprenderá” vs. “aprende”, “oraciones” instead of “frases” in a couple of spots) slightly hinder smooth comprehension for a native reader.  Overall, readers can grasp the content without major effort.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally, but there are several awkward or non‑standard expressions.  The use of the acronym “AIC (Aprendizaje In‑Contexto)” instead of the expected “ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)” and the phrase “la IA no ha ‘olvidado’ en el sentido humano” feel slightly forced.  Vocabulary is mostly appropriate, but these quirks reduce the fluidity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly translated correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\".  The only slip is the mislabeling of ICL as AIC, which could confuse readers familiar with the acronym.  Otherwise, terminology is consistent and accurate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and tone well.  Cultural references are adapted appropriately for Spanish‑speaking audiences, and the analogy of a consultant remains clear.  Minor adjustments (e.g., replacing “consultor” with “consultor brillante”) maintain the original nuance.  No major cultural misalignments are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present.  No significant content was omitted, and the dialogue flow is preserved.  Slight typographical oversights (missing hyphen in “preentrenamiento”) do not materially affect comprehension, and redundancy has been avoided.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is strong overall, delivering the core concepts with good clarity and a natural tone for Spanish speakers.  Minor inconsistencies—particularly with the ICL acronym and a few slightly awkward expressions—prevent it from being perfect, but the text remains comprehensible and faithful to the original intent.  With small refinements, it would reach near‑flawless quality."
