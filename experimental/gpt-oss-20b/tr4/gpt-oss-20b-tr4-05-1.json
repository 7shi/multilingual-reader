  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to read, with clear explanations of complex concepts such as pre‑training and in‑context learning. Sentences are well‑structured and logically organized, mirroring the flow of the original French. A few long sentences could be shortened for even smoother comprehension, but overall the text remains comprehensible for a general audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary choices are appropriate, and most idiomatic expressions are rendered correctly. Minor awkwardness appears in a few phrases (e.g., “tiene la impresión de que están empezando a recordar” could be tightened to “parece que recuerdan”), but these do not impede overall fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled accurately and consistently: “fine‑tuning” → “afinación”, “transfer learning” → “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “in‑context learning” → “aprendizaje en contexto”, and “grounding” → “anclaje”. The translation maintains a coherent terminology throughout the episode.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects cultural expectations and linguistic conventions of Spanish‑speaking audiences. Phrases such as “una inteligencia artificial” are omitted where unnecessary, and expressions are adapted to sound natural in Spanish media. The adaptation preserves the original intent and humor without introducing culturally inappropriate references.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French text is present, with no significant omissions. The Spanish version includes the same dialogues, explanations, and illustrative analogies. Minor redundancy is minimal, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, accurately conveying the original content while maintaining natural Spanish fluency. Small refinements could improve readability in a few lengthy sentences, but the overall effort demonstrates strong linguistic and technical competence."
