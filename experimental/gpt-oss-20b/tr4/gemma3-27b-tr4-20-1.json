  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version uses clear sentence structures and avoids overly complex constructions, making it easy for native readers to follow. Minor issues include occasional long sentences that could be broken up for even smoother flow.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, but a few phrases feel slightly literal or awkward (e.g., \"El ajuste fino (fine-tuning)\" could be more smoothly integrated as \"el ajuste fino\" without the parentheses). Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are translated correctly and consistently: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", and \"anclaje (grounding)\". Explanations accompany less familiar terms, aiding comprehension.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue maintains the casual, conversational tone suitable for a podcast script and adapts cultural references (e.g., referring to university graduates) in a way that resonates with Spanish speakers. Minor adjustments could improve cultural specificity in a few instances.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original is present, including explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning. No substantive omissions, and redundancy is largely avoided. The translation keeps the content concise and clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the original content with accurate terminology and clear, natural phrasing. Minor refinements could enhance fluency, but overall the script would be well received by Spanish‑speaking audiences listening to a tech podcast. The translation demonstrates strong linguistic competence and good contextual awareness, making it suitable for professional use without further editing beyond small stylistic tweaks. Overall score: 18/20."
