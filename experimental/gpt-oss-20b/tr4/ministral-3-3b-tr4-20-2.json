    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text contains several residual French words (e.g., ‘Donc’, ‘Exactement’, ‘Luc: Et je suis Luc’) that interrupt the flow for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Some sentences are fragmented or improperly punctuated, which hinders a smooth read. However, most ideas are still understandable because the key terms and structures are in Spanish. Overall, readers can follow the main points but will have to mentally filter out the stray French fragments.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are multiple awkward or incorrect phrases (e.g., ‘Et soyoy Luc’, ‘Luc: Luc:’). The text does not sound natural to a native Spanish speaker; several colloquial expressions are translated literally or left untranslated, producing a choppy rhythm. While basic grammar is mostly correct, the presence of mixed languages and typos reduces the overall fluency.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre-entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *in‑context learning* (ICL), *grounding*, and *memoria* are correctly rendered and consistently used. Minor inconsistencies arise where French words are retained instead of their Spanish equivalents, but the core terminology remains appropriate and understandable for a non‑expert audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to preserve the casual, conversational tone of a podcast. However, the inadvertent insertion of French words and the literal rendering of some expressions (e.g., ‘And I am Luc’ → ‘Et soyoy Luc’) dilute the cultural adaptation to Spanish-speaking listeners. The overall intent of the original is kept, but the adaptation quality is mixed.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most content from the original is present, but some sentences are truncated or garbled (e.g., the repeated ‘Luc: Luc:’, missing verbs in ‘Luc: Et soyoy Luc’). Additionally, the translation sometimes omits the explanatory nuance that was clear in French (e.g., the metaphor about a bicycle). The essential information is there, but redundancies and omissions affect clarity.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the basic narrative of the podcast, and technical terms are largely handled correctly. However, the mixture of French and Spanish, typos, and several awkward phrasings significantly undermine readability and fluency. The translator should carefully proofread for language consistency, correct the erroneous fragments, and refine the natural flow to make the script suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. With these adjustments, the translation would improve markedly in all criteria, especially fluency and contextual adaptation. Currently, the quality is acceptable for a first draft but requires substantial revision before publication or broadcast.  Overall, a moderate score reflecting these strengths and weaknesses is appropriate."
