  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version uses simple sentence structures and clearly explains complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., \"informaciones\" instead of \"información\") slightly reduce clarity, but overall readers can follow the dialogue easily.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds largely natural for Spanish speakers, with most expressions flowing smoothly. However, there are a few non‑native phrasings – such as \"no les enseñarías\" and \"el sistema busca rápidamente…\" – that feel a bit awkward. These do not impede comprehension but slightly lower the fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled accurately and consistently: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\". The translator preserved the meaning of key concepts and kept the terminology appropriate for a general audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original to a Spanish‑speaking context – e.g., translating \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Tech Relámpago\" and using culturally familiar analogies. The overall intent and tone are preserved, though some expressions (like \"en la sugerencia, detrás de escena\") could be fine‑tuned for native idiomatic usage.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French script are present: the stages of AI learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, the concept of in‑context learning, and the explanation of memory‑like features. No significant content is omitted; redundancy is kept minimal.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is faithful and clear, effectively conveying the original dialogue’s concepts to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor grammatical and stylistic tweaks would raise the naturalness and polish, but the current version is already quite competent and accessible to readers with a general understanding of AI terminology. Overall, it represents a solid translation that balances technical accuracy with readability and cultural adaptation, suitable for a podcast transcript or educational material aimed at a broad audience. A slight refinement of some non‑native phrasing would bring it to a near‑perfect level of fluency and naturalness. The overall evaluation scores the translation at 17/20, reflecting its strong performance across all criteria while acknowledging a few small areas for improvement."
