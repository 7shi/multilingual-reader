  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version uses clear sentence structures and logical progression. The key concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are described in an understandable way. Some passages are a bit long but still readable for a general audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly flows naturally, but there are a few awkward or slightly literal expressions. For example, \"Se puede decir eso\" and the repeated use of quotation marks around French terms give the text a slightly choppy feel. Vocabulary is contemporary and appropriate, yet a few phrases could be smoother.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\". However, the term *grounding* was kept in French as \"ancrage\" and the acronym ICL is not expanded, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the English term.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and style of the podcast are preserved. Cultural references are minimal, and the translation is accessible to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Yet some literal borrowings (e.g., \"ancrage\") and the lack of Spanish equivalents for certain terms reduce the naturalness of the adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All main points from the original transcript are present, with no omissions. The Spanish version even expands on a few explanations, keeping the content concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid overall: it conveys the original meaning and structure well, but could benefit from polishing a few terminology choices and phrasing to improve naturalness. With minor adjustments the text would read even more smoothly."
