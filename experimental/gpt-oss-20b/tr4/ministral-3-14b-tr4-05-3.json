  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly understandable; however, the frequent duplication of speaker labels (e.g., \"Luc: Luc:\") interrupts the flow and can confuse readers. Sentences are generally logical, but these repetitions make the text feel choppy. The content itself remains clear, but the formatting detracts from overall readability.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most of the language sounds natural, the repeated speaker prefixes create awkwardness. Some choices, such as \"entrenamiento previo\" instead of the more common \"preentrenamiento\", are slightly unconventional. The use of asterisks and quotation marks around terms like *prompt* is acceptable, but the overall smoothness is hindered by the repetitive structure.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"in-context learning\" (ICL), and \"grounding\". The translator preserved the key jargon and even provided explanatory context where needed. Minor variations in wording (e.g., \"entrenamiento previo\" vs \"preentrenamiento\") do not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references and idiomatic expressions were adapted appropriately (e.g., \"empollar\" for \"bachoter\"). The duplicated labels, however, reduce the natural feel for Spanish listeners. Overall, the contextual adaptation is good but slightly impaired by formatting errors.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French transcript are present. The explanation of pretraining, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge is maintained. No substantive content was omitted, and the translation adds no unnecessary repetition beyond the duplicated speaker labels.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation accurately conveys the technical content and preserves the conversational style of the original podcast. However, the frequent repetition of speaker labels and some minor wording choices reduce the overall fluidity and readability. With a few edits to remove the duplicated prefixes, the translation would achieve a higher level of polish."
