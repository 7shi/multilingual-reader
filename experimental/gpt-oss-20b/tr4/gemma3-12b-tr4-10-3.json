    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to read for native speakers. Sentences are generally short and logical, though a few longer passages (e.g., the paragraph explaining the memory feature) could be broken down further for better flow. The translation keeps the original’s conversational tone and uses familiar phrasing, which aids comprehension. Minor improvements in sentence structure would raise the score slightly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the text reads smoothly and feels natural. However, some verbatim transfers from French (e.g., “Lo has entendido todo”) feel slightly literal, and a few idiomatic expressions (“es una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado”) could be refined. The vocabulary is contemporary and appropriate for a general audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", and \"ventana de contexto\" are correctly translated. The choice of \"anclaje\" for \"grounding\" is acceptable, though alternatives like \"enraizamiento\" exist. Acronyms like ICL are left unchanged but explained in the context. Overall, terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation takes into account Spanish cultural expectations by using familiar expressions and a conversational style. Contextual references (e.g., comparing the AI to a consultant) resonate well with Spanish-speaking listeners. Minor cultural nuances could be further adapted, but the current version is effectively tailored.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French text are preserved: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the distinction between temporary and permanent memory. No significant information is omitted, and the translation remains concise without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, accurately conveying the original content while maintaining a natural and engaging tone. Minor stylistic refinements could raise fluency, but the overall readability and technical clarity are excellent. The translation is ready for a general Spanish‑speaking audience."
