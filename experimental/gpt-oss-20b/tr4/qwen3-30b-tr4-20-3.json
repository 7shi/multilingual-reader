  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly understandable where it appears, but the frequent gaps and abrupt line breaks interrupt the flow. Sentences are short and generally clear, yet the absence of many lines means readers must infer missing content, reducing overall readability. The structure remains logical where present, but the omissions create a disjointed experience.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adopts a natural register overall, using contemporary vocabulary. However, some phrases feel slightly literal or awkward (e.g., \"El afinado... es allí donde interviene…?\" and the misuse of present tense in the physics analogy). The repeated use of English terms in parentheses (e.g., \"grounding\") is acceptable but could be more idiomatic. Overall, the text sounds fairly smooth but with minor fluency issues.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly correctly rendered: \"pré-entraînement\" → \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\" → \"El afinado…\", \"in‑context learning\" → \"aprendizaje en contexto\". Some terms like \"grounding\" are partially translated as \"anclaje\" while retaining the English word in parentheses, which is acceptable for a bilingual audience. Consistency is good, though the absence of several key terms (e.g., \"fine‑tuning\" in a few spots) slightly weakens terminology coverage.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references are minimal and generally stay appropriate for Spanish-speaking listeners. However, some idiomatic adaptations (e.g., the analogy with a brilliant physicist) feel a bit forced in Spanish. The speaker names and podcast title remain unchanged, which is suitable.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A significant portion of the original dialogue is omitted in the translation, with many lines simply missing after the speaker labels. This leads to a loss of key explanations, examples, and conversational turns, making the translation incomplete. While some content is preserved, the overall picture is fragmented.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates solid linguistic skill in terms of vocabulary choice and basic sentence structure, but its most glaring flaw is the omission of large sections of the original script. These gaps severely compromise comprehensibility and leave listeners without the full context or explanations intended by the hosts. Fluency and terminology are generally good, but the incomplete nature of the text pulls down the overall quality."
