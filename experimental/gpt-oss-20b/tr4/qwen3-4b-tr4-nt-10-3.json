  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to follow and preserves the logical flow of the French script. Sentences are not overly long and the key ideas are clearly conveyed. Minor hiccups—such as the misplaced pronoun “Usted” in a casual dialogue and a few awkward phrasings—slightly interrupt the flow but do not prevent comprehension. Overall, the text is quite readable for a general Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places but contains several grammatical slips and unusual word choices that reduce its polish. Examples include the erroneous “Usted ha entendido todo” in an informal context, the typo “antisseta”, and the phrase “una memoria a uso único” which feels clunky. Despite these flaws, the majority of sentences are smooth and idiomatic, so the overall fluency is solid but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto* (ICL), *ventana de contexto*, and *anclaje* (grounding) are all accurately rendered. The occasional mix‑up between *afinado* and *ajuste fino* is minor and does not hinder understanding. Consistency across the transcript is good, though a few minor variations (e.g., “aprendizaje por transferencia” vs. “transfer learning”) could be standardized.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the French tone to Spanish, using familiar expressions such as “hola” for the opening and maintaining the informal conversational style. Cultural references remain neutral and appropriate for a Spanish audience. Some stylistic choices—like “¿Es una trampa?”—could be smoother, but overall the intent and humor of the original are preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the essential content from the French source is present. No major facts or explanations are omitted, and the dialogue structure is intact. Minor typographical errors do not affect the overall message. The translation even expands slightly on the memory feature to clarify the “memory” function, which improves reader understanding without adding redundancy.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version is a solid translation that successfully conveys the original meaning and conversational tone. Its main shortcomings are a handful of grammatical mistakes and a few awkward word choices that could be polished for a more natural read. Nonetheless, it is largely accurate, comprehensive, and suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners."
