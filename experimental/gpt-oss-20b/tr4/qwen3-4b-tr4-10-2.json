    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but numerous typographical errors, mistranslations, and awkward phrasing (e.g., \"franción\", \"rep aprender\", \"la silla\" instead of \"bicicleta\") interrupt the flow. Some sentences become confusing or unintelligible, which lowers overall readability.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural constructions and grammatical mistakes (missing articles, gender mismatches, incomplete sentences). Phrases such as \"La IA no ha \"olvidado\" en el sentido humano\" or \"el aprendizaje en contexto, es del copiar\" sound contrived to a native Spanish speaker. The overall fluency is compromised.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms like *preentrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning* (presented as *afinamiento*), *in‑context learning* (ICL) are mostly preserved, but some are misspelled or incorrectly adapted (e.g., *franción* for *francés*, *aprendrá*). The consistency of terminology could be improved, though the main concepts are still recognizable.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and explains concepts, but certain idiomatic expressions are not fully natural in Spanish. Repetitive use of \"por lo tanto\" and the direct translation of French idioms without cultural adaptation limit the contextual quality. Some parts that would benefit from localizing language (e.g., “consultant” → “consultor”) are either omitted or poorly adapted.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are accurately rendered, yet the final segment of the translation is truncated after \"astú\", leaving the concluding remarks incomplete. Additionally, several sentences are partially cut off or missing context. Therefore, while most information is present, the omission and truncation reduce completeness.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a clear attempt to convey the original French content into Spanish, and many core ideas are retained. However, the presence of numerous spelling and grammatical errors, mistranslations, and an incomplete ending considerably undermine the quality. A thorough proofreading, correction of technical terms, and completion of the missing part are necessary to reach a professional standard. The current version would be suitable only as a rough draft for further revision rather than as a final deliverable for native Spanish-speaking audiences. The translator should focus on improving fluency, ensuring correct terminology, and fully completing the dialogue before submission. "
