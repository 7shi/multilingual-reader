  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely comprehensible for a native audience. Sentence structures follow the original order, and complex ideas such as pre‑training and fine‑tuning are explained clearly. However, there are a few minor syntactic issues (e.g., “Luc: Imaginen que…” appears twice, missing punctuation in some lines) that slightly interrupt the flow. Overall readability is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads mostly smoothly and uses appropriate vocabulary. Some phrases feel slightly literal or awkward, such as “Se puede decir eso” or the repeated “Luc: Luc:”. Also, the translation mixes English terminology (“prompt”) with Spanish, which may confuse readers. The overall naturalness is acceptable, but a few adjustments would make it more idiomatic.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, ventana de contexto, anclaje. The Spanish equivalents are accurate and familiar to the target audience. Minor inconsistencies, like using “prompt” instead of a Spanish equivalent, are present but do not detract significantly from comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and maintains the conversational tone of a podcast. Cultural references remain appropriate for Spanish‑speaking listeners, and the adaptation of expressions such as “consultor brillante” or “entrenar” is suitable. Some small cultural nuances (e.g., using “conversación” vs. “ventana de conversación”) could be refined, but overall the context is well preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. The dialogue, explanations, and examples are fully included. No major omissions were detected. The text does not add unnecessary redundancy, and the translation remains concise while preserving clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material, with accurate terminology and faithful rendering of the conversational style. Minor fluency and punctuation issues are present but do not severely impact comprehension. With a few stylistic refinements, the translation could achieve a higher level of naturalness and polish. Overall, it is a competent and useful translation for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts discussed in the podcast context."
