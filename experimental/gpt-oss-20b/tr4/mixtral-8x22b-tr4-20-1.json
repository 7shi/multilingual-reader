    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the dialog structure and most of the original meaning. Readers can follow the conversation and understand the main concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning. Minor punctuation issues (missing commas after some interjections) do not seriously hinder comprehension. The sentences are generally clear, although some phrases are a bit clunky (“El modelo en sí no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus discusiones”), but still understandable.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The overall flow is acceptable, but several awkward phrasings and inconsistent abbreviations break naturalness. For example, \"aprendizaje en contexto, o AIC (aprendizaje en contexto)\" is redundant and uses a wrong abbreviation (ICL should be used). The duplication \"Luc: Luc:\" and the use of \"afino\" instead of \"ajuste fino\" also make the text feel less polished. A native Spanish speaker would find some parts slightly forced or unnatural.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly translated correctly, but there are notable mistakes: \"fine‑tuning\" becomes \"afino\", which is not a standard term in Spanish technical literature. The abbreviation for In‑Context Learning is incorrectly rendered as AIC. Despite these errors, the core concepts are still identifiable. Consistency across the text is lacking due to the mixed use of English and Spanish terminology.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original names (Tech Eclair) and cultural references, but some expressions are not fully adapted to Spanish idioms. The explanation of the consulting analogy is clear, yet the phrase \"proporcionarle los documentos de información exacta\" sounds slightly literal. Overall, the cultural adaptation is adequate but could be smoother.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the concluding remarks. No substantial information is omitted. The only small redundancy is the repeated mention of \"aprendizaje en contexto\" with the wrong abbreviation, which does not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main ideas and dialogue structure, but it suffers from several terminology mistakes and awkward phrasing that reduce its professional quality. A native Spanish speaker might read it with some effort, especially due to the misuse of technical terms and inconsistent abbreviations. With a few corrections—especially replacing \"afino\" with \"ajuste fino\" and using \"ICL\" for in‑context learning—the translation would be much clearer and more accurate."
