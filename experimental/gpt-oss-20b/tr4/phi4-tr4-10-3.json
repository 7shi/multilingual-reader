  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically structured and complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in a way that non‑technical listeners can grasp. Minor pauses in flow (e.g., the repeated “¡Exactamente!”) do not obstruct comprehension. Score: 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation uses mostly natural Spanish, but several expressions feel slightly literal or awkward. For instance, “Aprendizaje In‑Contextual” and “AICL” are not idiomatic; the Spanish equivalents would be “Aprendizaje en contexto” and simply “ICL.” Repetitive interjections (“¡Exactamente!”) and some verb conjugations (“sigue” vs. “continuar”) break the flow. The vocabulary is generally appropriate, yet a few phrases could be smoothed. Score: 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: “fine‑tuning” → “afinamiento”, “transfer learning” → “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “grounding” → “anclaje”, “context window” → “ventana de contexto”. The consistent use of Spanish terminology, with clear translations for each concept, facilitates understanding. Minor inconsistencies (e.g., “Aprendizaje In‑Contextual” vs. the standard “Aprendizaje en contexto”) slightly diminish precision. Score: 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the conversational tone and humor of the original French script. Cultural references are adapted appropriately for Spanish‑speaking listeners, and idiomatic expressions like “como contratar a un consultor brillante” match the original intent. However, some local flavor could be enhanced (e.g., using “in‑contextual” is not common in Spanish). Overall, the target audience’s cultural background is respected. Score: 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present. No substantive content is omitted, and the Spanish version maintains the same level of detail and nuance. The script’s structure (introduction, body, conclusion) is intact, and redundant phrasing is avoided. Minor differences (e.g., slightly shorter sentence breaks) do not affect comprehension. Score: 19/20.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation effectively conveys the technical concepts and conversational style of the original French script. Readability and completeness are strong, with clear explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning. Fluency would benefit from polishing some expressions and aligning terminology with standard Spanish usage (especially regarding “Aprendizaje en contexto” and the abbreviation ICL). Overall, the translation is competent and accessible for Spanish‑speaking audiences, with room for minor stylistic refinements to reach native‑level naturalness. 17/20 is a fair overall rating, reflecting the solid technical fidelity and the need for slight fluency improvements."
