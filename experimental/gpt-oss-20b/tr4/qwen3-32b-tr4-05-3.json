  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely clear and understandable for native speakers. Sentences follow a logical order, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are introduced without excessive jargon. Some phrasing is a little literal (e.g., \"para darle una cultura general\"), but it does not impede comprehension. Overall readability is strong, meriting 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text flows well in most places, but a few expressions feel slightly mechanical or awkward due to a literal translation of idiomatic French expressions. For example, \"Imaginen que enviamos una IA completamente nueva a la escuela\" and \"el sistema busca rápidamente en sus intercambios anteriores\" are understandable but could be phrased more naturally. These small fluency issues lower the score to 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, memoria a corto plazo, etc. The terminology matches common Spanish NLP usage, and no key concepts are missing. Minor variations (e.g., using \"afinamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\") do not affect understanding. Thus the terminology deserves 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references remain appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The adaptation could be slightly improved by replacing some literal phrases with more idiomatic Spanish, but overall it conveys the same friendly, explanatory style. Score: 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No key details are omitted, and the sequence of ideas remains intact. Redundancy is minimal and the translation stays concise. Therefore, it merits a high score of 19/20.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is generally effective, accurately conveying the technical content while maintaining a conversational tone suitable for a podcast audience. Minor fluency and wording adjustments could enhance naturalness, but the translation is clear, consistent, and complete. Overall, it is a solid rendition of the original material with room for small stylistic refinements."
