  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, but a number of punctuation mistakes and some untranslated English fragments (e.g., \"Exactly.\") interrupt the flow. Sentences are sometimes abrupt or poorly punctuated, which can make long passages harder to follow. Overall, the reader can grasp the main ideas, but clarity would improve with smoother sentence construction and consistent punctuation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many phrases feel stilted or literal (e.g., \"Usted lo ha comprendido todo\" in a casual dialogue, \"ancoraje\" instead of the more common \"anclaje\", and the awkward \"simplemente proporcionarle los documentos\" missing a subject). The presence of untranslated English words reduces naturalness. The vocabulary is mostly appropriate, but several expressions are clunky or non‑idiomatic, lowering fluency to about 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"In-Context Learning\" are accurate. However, the translation of \"grounding\" as \"ancoraje\" is a less common choice; \"anclaje\" would be clearer. The occasional use of English terms (e.g., \"fine‑tuning\" left as a parenthetical) is acceptable but inconsistent. Terminology remains largely accurate, earning a score of 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the overall tone of a casual podcast and preserves the original intent. Cultural references are minimal, but the Spanish phrasing could be more idiomatic (e.g., replacing \"Usted\" with a more natural \"Tú\" or omitting formal pronouns). Adaptation is good but could be refined for a native audience, resulting in 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French source are present; the structure of the dialogue is maintained. Minor omissions include the stray English words that could confuse readers, but no substantive content is missing. The translation remains concise and clear, so it scores 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the core concepts of the original French text and preserves the conversational style of the podcast. However, several issues reduce its quality: untranslated English fragments, punctuation errors, some non‑idiomatic word choices, and occasional grammatical slips. With minor revisions—removing the English words, polishing punctuation, and replacing less common terminology—this version would be a solid, natural-sounding translation suitable for a native Spanish-speaking audience. Overall, the translation demonstrates a good grasp of technical concepts but would benefit from a final round of editing to enhance fluency and readability. Overall score: 71/100 (roughly 7.1/10)."
