    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows a logical sentence structure, but the presence of English‑style parenthetical notes and occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., “Se puede decir eso”) interrupts the flow and can confuse readers. 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The majority of sentences read smoothly and use appropriate contemporary vocabulary. However, there are several unnatural expressions (e.g., “Se puede decir eso”, “en el fondo”) and the interjection of English comments such as \"Here is the translation:\" and \"or in a more fluent translation:\" break the naturalness expected from a polished Spanish text. 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely rendered correctly – \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\" – and are consistent throughout. Minor issues include the abbreviation \"ICL\" not being clarified and occasional missing explanations, but overall the terminology is appropriate for a general audience. 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the conversational tone and cultural references (e.g., consulting metaphor) suitable for Spanish speakers. Some expressions are less idiomatic than they could be, such as the literal rendering of “it’s a trick” as “Se puede decir eso.” Cultural nuance is otherwise respected. 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory. The inclusion of meta‑commentary (\"Here is the translation:\" etc.) is extraneous but does not remove core information. The translation remains fairly concise while retaining necessary details. 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main concepts and maintains a clear, conversational style suitable for a general audience. However, it suffers from some non‑native phrasing, unnecessary English comments, and occasional mis‑rendering of idioms, which detract from its polish. The technical terminology is largely accurate, but the contextual adaptation could be improved by smoothing awkward expressions. Overall, it is a decent first‑draft translation that would benefit from a careful copy‑edit to remove meta‑comments and refine language naturalness. 14/20 is an appropriate overall assessment.  "
