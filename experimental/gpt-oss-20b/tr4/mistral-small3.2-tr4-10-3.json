  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to read and follows the logical flow of the original dialogue. Long sentences are broken into manageable chunks, and explanations of complex concepts such as pre‑training and in‑context learning are clear. The repeated use of the phrase \"por lo tanto\" can make the text feel slightly monotonous, but it does not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural to a native Spanish speaker, but there are a few awkward constructions: \"la IA no se está afinando constantemente\" should be \"la IA no se está afinando constantemente\" (the reflexive form is not needed), \"partes de un contexto vacío\" contains a typo (\"partes\" instead of \"parte\"), and some verb tenses feel inconsistent. Vocabulary choices are appropriate, but the overuse of \"por lo tanto\" makes the prose feel repetitive.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje (grounding)\", \"memoria a corto plazo\". These terms are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience and are explained when necessary, maintaining fidelity to the source.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the cultural and linguistic norms of Spanish‑speaking listeners. The conversational tone and use of everyday expressions (e.g., comparing a model to a graduate) translate well. Minor improvements could be made to reduce repetition and tailor expressions more closely to target idioms, but overall intent and purpose are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French text are present. No significant omissions were detected. The dialogue remains faithful to the source, and the translator did not add extraneous information. A few repetitive segments could be trimmed for brevity without losing content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers a clear, accurate rendition of the original podcast script, maintaining technical fidelity and conversational tone. Minor stylistic refinements—reducing repetitive phrases and correcting small grammatical slips—would elevate the fluency and readability. Overall, the Spanish version is of high quality and should serve its intended audience well with a few polish adjustments. 85/100 (average 17/20)."
