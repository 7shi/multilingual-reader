    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the logical flow of the original dialogue. However, several sentences suffer from awkward word order (e.g., \"El historial completo de su discusión…\" instead of \"El historial completo de tu conversación…\"), missing accents, and occasional pronoun mismatches. These issues slightly hinder quick comprehension but do not prevent it.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains noticeable remnants of English (e.g., \"Exactly.\", \"ICL\"), occasional mis‑conjugations (“partimos” instead of “partes”), and some unnatural phrasing such as \"El modelo en sí no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus conversaciones\". While the vocabulary is generally correct, the overall flow feels choppy and would sound more natural with smoother sentence construction.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly translated appropriately: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", \"memoria a corto plazo\". The consistency of terms is good, and the speaker’s intention is preserved. Minor issues include occasional literal translations that could be phrased more idiomatically (e.g., \"memory to short term\" → \"memoria a corto plazo\").",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely preserves the original intent and conversational tone. Nonetheless, some culturally specific idioms are left in a literal form that feels slightly formal or unnatural for a Spanish‑speaking audience. A few expressions (e.g., “consultor brillante”) could be more localized. Overall adaptation is adequate but could be refined.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant content is omitted; the transcript’s narrative and explanations remain intact. Minor omissions include missing accents and the presence of some English words that slightly change the meaning. The translation does not add extraneous information, keeping the content concise.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation faithfully conveys the main ideas of the original French podcast and maintains the dialogue structure. However, the presence of residual English terms, inconsistent pronouns, missing accents, and some awkward phrasing reduce readability and naturalness. With careful editing to remove English remnants, correct grammatical issues, and polish the flow, the translation would reach a high level of quality suitable for native Spanish‑speaking audiences."
