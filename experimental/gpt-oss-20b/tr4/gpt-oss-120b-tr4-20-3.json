    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and easy to follow. Sentence structures mimic the original French dialogue, and complex concepts such as pre‑training and fine‑tuning are explained in straightforward language. Minor issues – e.g., the singular “Lee” for the AI and the awkward phrasing “se recuerda” – slightly reduce flow but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural for native Spanish speakers, with appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic expressions. However, small grammatical slips like “El IA” instead of “la IA”, “se recuerda” and “¿Porque?” (instead of “¿Por qué?”) slightly interrupt the natural rhythm. Overall, the translation reads smoothly with only minor anomalies.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately translated and consistently used. Phrases such as “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “fine‑tuning”, “in‑context learning (ICL)” and “grounding” are correctly rendered, matching common Spanish NLP terminology. No major inaccuracies or omissions are present.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator maintains the original intent and conversational tone while adapting cultural references (e.g., using “consultor brillante” and “programa de formación”). The Spanish audience can relate to the examples without feeling out of context. Minor style choices could be tweaked, but overall adaptation is strong.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines and explanations from the French original are present; no key information is omitted. Redundancy is minimal and the content remains concise and coherent.",
