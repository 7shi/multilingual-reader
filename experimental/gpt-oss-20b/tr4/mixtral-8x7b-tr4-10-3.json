  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is fairly readable but suffers from many abrupt parenthetical notes (e.g., \"(This is the step known as pre-training.)\") that interrupt the flow. Sentences are sometimes fragmented or truncated, which can confuse the reader. The overall structure is understandable but not entirely smooth.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most phrases sound natural, several expressions are awkward or non‑idiomatic (e.g., \"La etapa siguiente ha sido durante mucho tiempo el 'afinamiento' (ajuste fino).\"), and the interspersion of parenthetical English comments disrupts the narrative rhythm. Vocabulary is generally appropriate, but the overall fluidity is compromised by these interruptions.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are generally correct – \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" – but inconsistencies arise (e.g., \"ancrage\" remains untranslated from French). Some terms are used out of context or lack necessary explanation for a lay audience. Consistency across the transcript is acceptable but could be improved.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps much of the original tone but fails to fully adapt idiomatic expressions to Spanish culture. The presence of many parenthetical English remarks indicates a lack of adaptation; the translator did not re‑phrase or localize jokes or colloquialisms, which weakens the cultural relevance of the script.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several sections of the original dialogue are omitted or truncated, and extra commentary is inserted where it does not belong. The result is a partial and sometimes misleading rendering of the source material. Essential information is missing, leading to an incomplete transcript.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation exhibits several fundamental flaws: inconsistent terminology, incomplete coverage of the source text, awkward phrasing, and unnecessary parenthetical English comments that interrupt readability. It requires a comprehensive rewrite to achieve a polished, accurate, and culturally appropriate Spanish version of the original French dialogue. The current draft would likely confuse or misinform listeners, especially those relying on the script for accurate technical understanding of AI concepts. A full revision focusing on faithful translation, coherence, and contextual adaptation is recommended before it could be considered publication‑ready."
