    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely comprehensible for a native reader and follows the dialogue structure of the original. Sentences are generally coherent, and the key ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory) are clearly conveyed. However, occasional literal or awkward phrasing – such as \"Usted ha entendido todo\" or \"El conocimiento que usted proporciona\" – slightly hampers fluency and can momentarily confuse the reader. Minor typographical issues (missing hyphens, missing accents) also affect readability.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the translation reads smoothly overall, several expressions feel forced or incorrect for Spanish speakers. For instance, \"Es una astucia\" should be \"¿Es una astucia?\", \"Usted ha entendido todo\" is formal and out of place in a conversational podcast script, and the inclusion of the French word \"antisèche\" is a clear slip. These issues reduce naturalness. The rest of the vocabulary and grammar are appropriate and contemporary.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: preentrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL. Consistency is good, but the choice of \"afinado\" for fine‑tuning is less idiomatic (\"ajuste fino\" would be preferable). The accidental use of the French word \"antisèche\" is a major error, as is the omission of the hyphen in \"pre‑entrenamiento\". Overall, the terminology is accurate but not fully polished.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural adaptation is generally appropriate – the metaphor of a consultant is kept, and the Spanish phrasing is mostly natural. However, some localized expressions could be improved (e.g., \"retirar el velo\" is a literal translation of \"lever le voile\" and may feel slightly formal). Additionally, the use of formal second‑person in a casual podcast setting may feel out of place. Minor cultural adjustments would enhance the adaptation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present, and the script maintains the same logical flow. No substantive information is omitted. Minor formatting issues (missing hyphens, accents) do not affect comprehension. The inclusion of the erroneous term \"antisèche\" slightly misrepresents the content, but overall the message is complete and concise.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material and conveys the main ideas effectively. However, several linguistic and cultural inaccuracies—particularly the use of formal language in a casual context, the French word \"antisèche\", and a few awkward phrases—reduce overall quality. Refining these areas would bring the translation to a higher standard of natural, polished Spanish suitable for a podcast audience. The technical terminology is largely correct, but consistency and idiomatic choices should be reviewed before final publication. Overall, the work is competent but requires polishing to meet professional standards for native Spanish listeners.  "
