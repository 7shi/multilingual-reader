  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is mostly easy to read and understand. The dialogue flow is preserved, complex ideas are explained in a clear way, and sentences are logically structured. A few typographical repetitions (e.g., an accidental double “Camille:”) slightly interrupt the flow but do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker, with appropriate vocabulary and sentence construction. Some minor awkward phrasing appears (e.g., “Lo olvida todo” instead of the more idiomatic “Olvida todo”) and a few grammatical inconsistencies (e.g., “la IA no se afina” instead of “la IA no se ajusta”), but overall the text feels smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “pre-entrenamiento,” “ajuste fino,” “aprendizaje por transferencia,” and “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)” are translated accurately and consistently. Where necessary, explanatory context is retained, so the terminology is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone, making it suitable for Spanish-speaking listeners. Cultural references are adapted sensibly, and the title “Tech Éclair” is kept, which matches the original. The phrase “¡Y hasta pronto!” is a bit unconventional but still understandable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No key information is omitted, and redundancy is minimal. The only issue is the accidental duplicate “Camille:” line, which does not change the meaning but slightly disrupts flow.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully reproducing the original dialogue while making it accessible and natural for Spanish-speaking listeners. Minor typographical and grammatical slips exist, but they do not significantly affect overall comprehension. With a few small edits, the translation would be considered excellent."
