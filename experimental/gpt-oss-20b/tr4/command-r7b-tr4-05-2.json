  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely comprehensible and follows a logical sentence structure. However, some parts become confusing due to typographical errors (e.g., “en la promoción” instead of “en el prompt”) and minor grammatical slips that interrupt the flow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly in most places, but several awkward or incorrect expressions diminish naturalness. Phrases such as “en la promoción”, “en backstage” and the redundant “en la promoción” are not idiomatic. These issues lower the fluency rating.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms like *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *grounding* (*anclaje*), *memoria a corto plazo* are handled correctly. The term *In‑Context Learning* is rendered as *Aprendizaje en Contexto Interno*, which is understandable but not the most common translation. Overall terminology is accurate but could be polished.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original dialogue style and intent. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is adequate. Minor adjustments (e.g., the phrase “en backstage” could be replaced with a more native expression) would improve it, but the core meaning remains intact.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all information from the source is present. The only notable omission is the mis‑translation of *prompt* as *promoción*, which changes the meaning in a few instances. No major content was left out, and the overall length and detail are comparable to the original.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is good overall and conveys the essential content and tone. However, several non‑native expressions and a few mis‑translations (particularly of *prompt* and *In‑Context Learning*) reduce clarity and naturalness. With minor edits to these points, the text would read as a polished Spanish transcript of the original French dialogue."
