  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to read and follows the original narrative flow. Minor issues—such as the odd phrasing “Ustedes entendieron todo” and the typo “Las conocimientos” instead of “Los conocimientos”—slightly disrupt smooth reading, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the text sounds natural for a Spanish speaker, though a few phrases feel slightly awkward: “Pueden tomar un modelo experto…”, “En el prompt” and the literal use of “afinado” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”. These small stylistic choices reduce fluency marginally.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly translated (preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, anclaje, ICL). The choice of ‘afinado’ for fine‑tuning is acceptable, though ‘ajuste fino’ is more common. Consistency is good overall.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts well to a Spanish audience, using appropriate greetings, cultural references, and avoiding literal French idioms. The overall intent and tone are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present. No significant omissions were found, and the text remains concise while adding necessary clarifications.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a strong grasp of the source material and effectively conveys its meaning to a Spanish-speaking audience. Minor linguistic inaccuracies and occasional unnatural phrasing slightly reduce its polish, but overall it is clear, fluent, and technically accurate. With a few revisions—particularly to phrasing and terminology consistency—the text would reach near‑perfect quality for a professional audience.\n\nOverall score: 17/20."
