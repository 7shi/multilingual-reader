  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to read for a native audience. Sentences are mostly short and follow the same logical order as the original. Some longer phrases (e.g., *« el proceso se llama aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto) »*) become slightly cumbersome, but the overall flow remains clear. Minor typographic issues (such as missing accents on *« Tech Relámpago »* in one instance) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, though there are a few spots where the wording feels a bit stilted. Repetitive phrases like *« Aprendizaje en Contexto »* after the acronym and the use of quotation marks for *« Tech Relámpago »* are slightly awkward. Nevertheless, the vocabulary is appropriate, contemporary, and grammatical, so the text feels smooth enough for everyday listening or reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: *pre-entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *Aprendizaje en Contexto (ICL)*, *anclaje* all match the French originals and are understood by a technical audience. No terms were omitted, and the translations are correct for the target level.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Cultural adaptation is solid: *Tech Relámpago* keeps the original playful tone, and everyday expressions are suitable for Spanish-speaking listeners. The conversation style remains informal and engaging, mirroring the French version. Slight adjustments (e.g., *« nos vemos »* at the end) fit local idiomatic patterns without distorting meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the original dialogue is present. No significant information was omitted or altered. The translation stays concise, only adding minimal filler where culturally appropriate, and avoids unnecessary repetition. The final sign‑off includes a friendly closing line that aligns with the original's intent.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the Spanish translation is very good. It maintains the original's meaning, technical accuracy, and conversational tone.
