  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is mostly easy to follow and the ideas are logically structured. Some small grammatical slips – e.g., *«una conocimiento temporal»* instead of *«un conocimiento temporal»* – mildly disrupt flow, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish is largely natural and smooth. A few expressions feel slightly literal or informal, such as *«Lo has entendido todo»* or *«Tal es la realidad del ICL»*, but they do not hinder understanding. Overall the prose reads well for a native audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently and appropriately: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *grounding*. Minor issues like the hyphen in *pre-entrenamiento* and the choice of *anti-sèche* → *chuleta* are acceptable translations, though the latter introduces slang.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references well, preserving the informal podcast style. However, there is an inconsistency between formal (*usted*) and informal (*tú*) pronouns, which could confuse some readers. Aside from that, the intent and tone of the original are well conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present; the translation adds no unnecessary information and keeps the dialogue concise. Minor wording changes do not omit meaning, so completeness is high.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "This is a very solid translation that preserves the spirit and technical accuracy of the original French podcast script. A few small grammatical and stylistic refinements would bring it to perfect score, but it already communicates the concepts clearly and naturally to Spanish-speaking listeners. Overall quality: excellent, with minor room for polishing consistency and fluency in a few spots."
