  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but several grammatical slips, missing articles, and odd phrasing (e.g., *las palabras*, *las conocimientos*) interrupt the flow. The overall message remains clear, yet the reader may pause or reread due to these small errors.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains a number of unnatural constructions, such as *Et soyoy Luc*, duplicated speaker tags (*Luc: Luc:*), and occasional English fragments (*Precisely*). These fragments break the rhythm and give a choppy, less polished feel. While the content is mostly coherent, the lack of smooth natural phrasing reduces overall fluency.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly preserved, but there is inconsistency: *pre-entrenamiento* is correct, yet *fine‑tuning* is left untranslated in some places and *afinado* is used elsewhere, which may confuse readers. Additionally, *grounding* is rendered as *anclaje*, which is acceptable, but the mix of *ICL* and *aprendizaje en contexto* is somewhat repetitive. Overall, terminology is adequate but could be more consistent.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation is uneven. The original podcast name *Tech Éclair* is changed to *Tech Flash* in the first line, and later restored, creating inconsistency. The translation also shifts tone in a few spots (e.g., *C'est une astuce ?* becomes a statement, losing the original nuance). Cultural references are preserved, but some context (e.g., *selle* translated as *silla*) is inaccurate.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original information is present, but a few details are omitted or misrepresented: the word *para siempre* is missing, the metaphor of a bicycle is rendered incorrectly (*silla* instead of *saddle*), and the nuance of *para siempre* in the line about fine‑tuning is lost. Nonetheless, the core ideas are still conveyed.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material and conveys the main concepts, but suffers from multiple linguistic errors, inconsistent terminology, and some contextual inaccuracies. These issues affect readability and fluency, though the information remains largely complete. A careful revision would improve naturalness and consistency."
