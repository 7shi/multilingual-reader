  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to follow and the structure mirrors the original. Long sentences occasionally become cumbersome, and the abrupt insertion of French fragments in the middle of the dialogue disrupts the flow, but most readers can still comprehend the main ideas.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation reads naturally; however, some expressions are slightly awkward (e.g., “se acuerda” instead of “recuerda”, “funciones de memorización”), and the unexpected French interjections significantly break the rhythm. This reduces the overall naturalness of the text.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje. The consistency is maintained throughout, though a few minor inconsistencies appear in the garbled section.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Cultural adaptation is generally good—use of greetings, idiomatic expressions, and audience-friendly explanations. The inserted French lines, however, detract from the intended Spanish‑only context.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The bulk of the original content is preserved, but the mid‑dialogue corruption (French text, missing punctuation, and a misplaced line about “la IA no ha olvidado”) leads to small gaps and a confusing narrative. The essential information remains, yet clarity is slightly compromised.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is strong in conveying the original ideas and terminology, but the inclusion of stray French sentences and a few awkward phrasing errors reduce readability and fluency. With minor revisions—removing the French fragments and smoothing the phrasing—the piece would be near perfect for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Overall, it demonstrates good understanding but needs polishing for professional publication."
