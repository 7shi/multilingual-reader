  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the dialogue’s clear, conversational structure and uses straightforward phrasing that is easy to follow for native speakers. Some sentences (e.g., “tú has entendido todo”) are slightly wordy but still understandable, and the overall logical flow mirrors the original. Minor awkwardness does not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally for most of the dialogue, with idiomatic expressions and contemporary vocabulary. However, there are a few instances of slightly stilted phrasing, such as “tú has entendido todo” and “la IA no se afinaba constantemente”. These do not break the flow but reduce the polish compared to a native‑written script. Overall, fluency is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled accurately: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL), and \"anclaje\" are correct and consistent. The translation also keeps the English terms where appropriate (e.g., \"fine‑tuning\"). Explanations accompany most terms, maintaining clarity for the intended audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references smoothly (e.g., greeting style, use of \"Hola y bienvenidos\"). The original’s informal, friendly tone is preserved, and expressions are chosen to fit Spanish‑speaking listeners. No major cultural misalignments are evident.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory mechanisms, and the concluding remarks. No essential information is omitted, and the dialogue remains concise without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is highly accurate and readable, faithfully conveying the original script’s content, tone, and technical detail. Minor fluency issues slightly affect naturalness, but overall the translation is of high quality and well‑adapted for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The translator demonstrates strong skill in balancing literal fidelity with readability and contextual relevance, resulting in a professional, audience‑friendly script suitable for a podcast format. A few minor wording tweaks could elevate the fluency to near‑perfect level, but the current version already serves its purpose effectively. The overall score reflects this near‑exemplary performance, with room for fine‑tuning of phrasing for complete naturalness."
