  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text preserves the conversational flow of the original French dialogue and uses straightforward sentence structures that most readers can follow. Some sentences are a bit long, and a few phrases are repeated (e.g., the explanation of ICL), which slightly reduces the ease of reading. However, overall the content is clear and comprehensible.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural, but there are a few awkward expressions such as \"Lo has entendido todo.\" and occasional capitalization inconsistencies (e.g., \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\"). The choice of vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, yet the flow could be smoother with minor adjustments.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", and \"anclaje\". The terms are used consistently throughout the text, and there are no mistranslations. Some explanatory comments are omitted but the target audience (general listeners) likely understand the concepts as presented.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the informal, podcast‑style tone of the original. Cultural references are minimal, so no major adjustments were needed. The adaptation respects Spanish idioms and maintains the intended meaning, making it suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, anchoring, memory functions, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No significant information was omitted, and redundancy is generally avoided, although a few repeated explanations could be streamlined.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the original message accurately, with only minor issues related to phrasing and stylistic consistency. It would benefit from a few smoothing edits but is otherwise ready for a native Spanish‑speaking audience."
