  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version uses simple, clear sentences and explains technical concepts in an accessible way. The logical flow mirrors the French script, making it easy for a native speaker to follow. Minor punctuation issues do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall, the text reads naturally and smoothly. Some phrases are slightly awkward, e.g., \"la IA no ha 'olvidado' en el sentido humano del término\" and the mismatch between \"tus\" and \"vuestras\". These small discrepancies do not derail the flow but slightly reduce the naturalness of the prose.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre-entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje en contexto* and *anclaje* are correctly rendered and consistent throughout. The only inconsistency is the pronoun mismatch (“tus” vs “vuestras”). Overall, terminology is handled appropriately.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts idiomatic expressions to Spanish and respects cultural context (e.g., using “tú” instead of “usted” consistently). The meaning and intent of the original are preserved. Minor wording choices could be further refined for a native audience, but adaptation is largely successful.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines and technical explanations from the French source are present. No essential information is omitted, and the text remains concise without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is highly faithful and readable, with only a few minor linguistic inconsistencies that do not compromise overall comprehension. It would benefit from a final proof‑read to fix pronoun mismatches and polish a couple of slightly awkward phrasings, but otherwise it meets the expectations for a clear, professional translation of a technical podcast script. The final evaluation score is 18/20, reflecting strong quality with room for minor refinement. Good work overall! 🏆🚀✨\n\n**Overall Score:** 18/20\n\n**Detailed reasoning:**  The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material and conveys complex concepts in a way that is both accurate and accessible to a Spanish‑speaking audience. While the fluency and terminology scores are slightly lower due to minor mismatches and a few awkward phrasings, these issues are minor compared to the overall fidelity and clarity. A final proof‑read would bring the work into the top tier of professional translations. Overall, the translator has successfully achieved the intended communication goals, making the content engaging and understandable for the target audience."
