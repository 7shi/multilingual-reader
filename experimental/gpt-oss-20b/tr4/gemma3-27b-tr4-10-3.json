  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly clear and easy to follow. Sentence structures mirror the original and complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL) are explained with suitable analogies. Minor issues arise from literal phrasing and occasional missing articles, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text reads reasonably well, yet several parts feel slightly awkward or non‑idiomatic. Examples include \"Lo has entendido todo\", \"Lo olvida todo\", and the borrowed word \"antisèche\" used out of context. Verb tense choices like \"aprenderá\" versus \"aprende\" also create small inconsistencies. These imperfections lower the fluency score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\". The translation remains consistent throughout, and the terminology is appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Only minor tense mismatches affect clarity slightly.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator keeps the informal, conversational tone of the podcast and adapts greetings to a Spanish context. However, some literal expressions (e.g., \"Lo has entendido todo\") and the use of a French loanword reduce cultural adaptation. The overall intent and purpose are conveyed well.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French transcript are present. No substantive content was omitted, and the translation maintains the same logical flow. A few words differ slightly in tense or phrasing, but these do not alter the conveyed information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully captures the gist and technical detail of the original French script. While readability and terminology are strong, some fluency issues—particularly awkward phrasing and minor grammatical slips—moderately detract from the text’s naturalness. With minor refinements, the Spanish version would read as smoothly as the source text does in French. Overall, a competent and faithful translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience, though not yet polished to native‑level elegance.\n\nScore: 18/20 (average of the criteria scores)."
