    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely comprehensible; the sentence structure follows a natural flow and complex concepts are explained in a straightforward manner. Minor issues such as missing accents on words like *pré-entrenamiento* and the occasional long list of characters in the original dialogue reduce readability slightly, but overall the target audience can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally reads smoothly, but there are a few awkward phrases and grammatical errors that interrupt naturalness. For example, *Lo entendiste todo* should be *Lo has entendido* and *El aprendizaje en contexto es el apretar* is an incorrect rendering of the French *bachotage* (should be *El aprendizaje en contexto es el bachotaje*). Additionally, some English terms such as *fine-tuning* and *grounding* were left untranslated or translated inconsistently. These issues slightly detract from the fluency of the text.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly (*pre-entrenamiento*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto*). However, *fine-tuning* and *grounding* were either left in English or inconsistently rendered (*anclaje* in one place, *grounding* in another). The translation also uses *apretar* where *bachotaje* would be more appropriate. Consistency across the dialogue would improve the terminology score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the informal podcast tone and preserves the original’s conversational style, which suits the target Spanish-speaking audience. Cultural references are minimal and the name *Tech Éclair* is retained. Overall, the adaptation is effective and appropriate for the context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present, but some nuances are lost or misinterpreted, particularly the explanation of *bachotage* as *apretar* and the incomplete rendering of *fine-tuning*. The content is concise but occasionally redundant, and a few lines (e.g., the sentence “Es una excelente observación” is a bit more verbose than necessary) could be trimmed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation communicates the core ideas of the original French script and maintains a conversational tone suitable for a podcast. Nonetheless, there are noticeable issues with terminology consistency, some awkward phrasing, and minor grammatical inaccuracies that reduce overall clarity and naturalness. Refining the translation of technical terms and polishing the sentence structure would bring the work closer to a professional standard."
