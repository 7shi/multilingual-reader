  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation conveys the main ideas clearly and the sentence structure is generally logical. However, some phrasing is slightly awkward (e.g., *La IA no se afina constantemente por tus conversaciones*), and a few sentences could be simplified for better flow. The content is still understandable for a native Spanish speaker, but the readability would benefit from a few adjustments.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The overall fluency is good, with most expressions sounding natural. Nevertheless, there are a few unnatural constructions (e.g., *La IA no se afina constantemente por tus conversaciones*, *se afina constantemente*). Also, the repetitive use of exclamations can feel a bit forced. Minor grammatical tweaks would raise the fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: *pre-entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)*, *ventana de contexto*, *grounding* → *anclaje*. These terms are appropriate for the target audience and the translations are clear. Only minor issues with the word choice for *grounding* (anclaje) exist but are acceptable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The cultural adaptation is largely adequate; the Spanish version retains the original structure and references that would be familiar to Spanish-speaking listeners. The use of the French title *Tech Éclair* is kept, which preserves brand identity. Some phrases could be more localized (e.g., *a la escuela* vs. *en la escuela*), but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French text is present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the essential explanations are intact. The only minor issue is a duplicated speaker tag (*Camille: Camille:*) that is a formatting error rather than a substantive omission. Redundancy is minimal and does not affect clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid overall, accurately conveying the technical content and maintaining the conversational tone of the original podcast. Slight improvements in fluency and readability would make the text feel more natural to native Spanish speakers, but the key concepts and terminology are handled correctly. The result is a clear, technically sound, and culturally appropriate translation."
