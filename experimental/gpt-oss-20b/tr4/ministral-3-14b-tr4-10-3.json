    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely understandable, but several duplicated speaker tags (e.g., \"Luc: Luc:\"), abrupt punctuation, and occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., \"empollarse\" to mean cramming) break the flow and can confuse readers. Sentence structures are generally logical, but the repetition and missing connectors reduce overall ease of reading. 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation often sounds unnatural due to duplicated speaker labels and slightly incorrect word choices (e.g., \"empollarse\" instead of a more appropriate expression for cramming). The use of English terms like \"fine‑tuning\" is acceptable but not fully natural in Spanish. The overall tone is conversational but suffers from grammatical inconsistencies. 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are handled correctly – \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\" – and are consistently used. However, the retention of English terms like \"fine‑tuning\" could be replaced by \"ajuste fino\" for better consistency, and the term \"empollarse\" is technically incorrect. Overall, terminology is good but not flawless. 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, but cultural adaptation is minimal. Some phrases are literal translations that could be more idiomatic (e.g., \"¿Se le ha justificado?\" is unnecessary). The duplicated speaker tags also hinder contextual clarity. 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All core content from the original is present; there are no significant omissions. The duplicated speaker tags add redundancy but do not remove information. Minor punctuation errors do not affect comprehension. 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful to the French source and covers all the important points. However, duplicated speaker labels, some awkward word choices, and minor punctuation issues detract from readability and fluency. Technical terminology is mostly correct, though a few terms could be better localized. Overall, the translation is acceptable but would benefit from a thorough copy‑edit to clean up repetitions and improve naturalness. Overall score: 14/20."
