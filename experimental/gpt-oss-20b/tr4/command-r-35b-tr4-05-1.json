  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely understandable to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Most concepts are clearly explained and the sentence structure follows the original flow. Minor issues such as missing accents (e.g., \"casa de la solución\") and slightly awkward phrasing in a few places reduce overall clarity, but listeners can still follow the dialogue.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most sentences read naturally, there are a handful of unnatural or incorrect expressions: \"en la casa de la solución\" (a mistranslation of \"behind the scenes\"), \"las leyes de el equilibrio\" (wrong article), and the abrupt cutoff in one sentence. These quirks interrupt the smoothness expected from a polished broadcast script, so the fluency is slightly below optimal.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"grounding\" translated as \"anclaje\". Some small deviations occur (e.g., \"fin‑tuning\" kept as \"fine‑tuning\" in one spot), but overall the terminology is appropriate and consistent for a general audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking context is generally effective. Cultural references remain neutral, and the conversational tone is preserved. However, the literal translation of some expressions (e.g., \"casa de la solución\") and the occasional literalism of the original dialogue diminish the natural feel for Spanish listeners.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Essential content is retained; the dialogue covers all key points about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL, and memory features. Minor omissions or mistranslations (e.g., the incomplete sentence about providing documents and the inaccurate phrase about behind‑the‑scenes) slightly affect clarity but do not remove any critical information.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers a solid, comprehensible script that faithfully conveys the original French dialogue. Nonetheless, a few linguistic inaccuracies and awkward phrasings hinder its polish. With minor revisions—especially correcting the mistranslated expressions and smoothing a few sentences—the script would reach a near‑perfect standard for a Spanish‑language podcast audience. Overall, the translation demonstrates good grasp of content and terminology but requires refinement for flawless fluency and precision. 14/20"
