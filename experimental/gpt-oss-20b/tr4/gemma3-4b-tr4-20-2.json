  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, but the frequent duplication of speaker tags (e.g., \"Camille: Camille:\" and \"Luc: Luc:\") interrupts the flow and makes the dialogue hard to follow. Some sentences are slightly awkwardly constructed, which can momentarily confuse a reader. Overall, the core ideas are clear, but the clutter reduces readability.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural expressions and minor grammatical errors (e.g., \"basado\" instead of \"basada\" for \"memoria\"), as well as duplicated punctuation and speaker labels. While the vocabulary is largely appropriate, these issues make the text feel choppy and less smooth for a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"pré‑entraînement\" → \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\" → \"ajuste fino\", \"in‑context learning\" → \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\". Terminology is consistent across the text, though the repetition of speaker tags occasionally obscures the precise term usage.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally preserves the conversational tone and intent of the original French podcast. However, some culturally specific references (e.g., the literal comparison to a university graduate) are kept verbatim, which works but could be refined for a Spanish audience. The duplication of speaker tags is a contextual oversight that diminishes adaptation quality.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is present, but a few lines are omitted or merged, and some explanatory details are less explicit. The duplicated speaker tags also lead to redundancy. Overall, the essential information is conveyed, but the translation could be more concise and thorough.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main ideas of the original French script and uses appropriate technical terminology. However, frequent duplication of speaker labels, some grammatical slips, and minor omissions hinder readability and fluency. A cleaner, more polished version would improve clarity and make the dialogue feel more natural to Spanish‑speaking listeners. The translation is acceptable for a quick conversion but requires editorial refinement for professional or broadcast use."
