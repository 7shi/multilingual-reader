  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many formatting glitches (repeated speaker tags, dangling parenthetical notes, incomplete sentences) that interrupt the flow. Sentences are often fragmented and sometimes contain untranslated fragments from the source text. As a result, a native Spanish reader would struggle to follow the dialogue and understand the overall narrative.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text is peppered with awkward phrasing and grammatical errors. Phrases like \"ajuste fine\" or \"memoria desechable\" feel unnatural; the repeated use of French words (e.g., \"prompt\", \"ancrage\") and the inclusion of explanatory notes in the middle of sentences break the natural rhythm of Spanish. These issues significantly reduce the smoothness of the translation.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pré‑entraînement*, *fin‑tuning*, *ICL* are translated inconsistently. Some terms are rendered correctly (e.g., *aprendizaje en contexto*), while others are misspelled or poorly chosen (e.g., *ajuste fine* instead of *ajuste fino*). There is no consistent approach to translating key jargon, which can confuse readers unfamiliar with the subject.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps many literal, French‑centric expressions that do not adapt well to Spanish cultural norms (e.g., direct use of *prompt*, *grounding*). The speaker tags are duplicated and some contextual cues are missing or mangled, reducing the overall sense of authenticity and cultural relevance for a Spanish audience.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is present, but the presence of cut‑off sentences and explanatory notes means that some details are omitted or unclear. The dialogue flow is disrupted, which could lead to misunderstandings of key points. Nonetheless, the bulk of information is retained, albeit in a cluttered form.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a basic understanding of the source material but suffers from significant structural, grammatical, and terminological errors. The presence of residual notes and repeated speaker tags makes the text unreadable for a general audience. A thorough revision is necessary to achieve a coherent, fluent, and contextually appropriate Spanish version of the podcast transcript. The overall quality is below acceptable standards for professional translation work. A score of 6/20 reflects the many flaws that need to be addressed before the translation can be considered usable."
