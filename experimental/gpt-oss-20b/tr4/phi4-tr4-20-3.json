  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to read and follows a logical flow. Sentences are long but coherent, and the dialogue format helps maintain clarity. Minor issues—such as the missing article in “una conocimiento” and the slightly awkward phrasing around the acronym—do not severely impede understanding, but they do introduce small bumps in readability.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly sounds natural to a native Spanish speaker. However, the use of the acronym “AIC” for ICL, the phrase “Aprendizaje In‑Contextual,” and the grammatical slip in “una conocimiento” detract from the smoothness. The overall tone is conversational, but a few expressions feel slightly mechanical.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento,” “afinamiento,” “aprendizaje por transferencia,” and “ventana de contexto” are correctly rendered. The replacement of “ICL” with “AIC” and the creation of “Aprendizaje In‑Contextual” are inaccurate, leading to potential confusion. The consistency of terminology is otherwise acceptable.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts French cultural references into Spanish equivalents effectively. Idiomatic expressions like “es como estudiar para un examen” fit Spanish usage. The dialogue keeps the friendly, informal style of the original. Cultural nuance is preserved, though some technical terms could be better localized.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original dialogue are present. The explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and memory features is intact. The only substantive omissions are minor; the main content is complete, with only a few wording inaccuracies.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core meaning and tone of the original French script with good readability and fluency. Nevertheless, there are notable technical inaccuracies—particularly with the acronym for in‑context learning—and a few grammatical slips that reduce precision. With minor revisions, the Spanish version could reach a higher level of accuracy and naturalness."
