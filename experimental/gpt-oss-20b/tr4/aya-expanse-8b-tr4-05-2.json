    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logical and the flow mirrors the original dialogue structure. However, occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., “El aprendizaje contextual es como hacer trampa en un examen”) slightly hinders smooth reading. Overall, readers can grasp the content without much effort.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads well overall, but there are a few non‑native constructions and minor grammatical slips. For example, “El aprendizaje contextual es como hacer trampa en un examen” sounds slightly forced, and some punctuation is missing. Vocabulary is generally appropriate, but a few expressions could be smoother (“conocimiento temporal y competencia permanente” could be “conocimiento temporal vs. competencia permanente”).",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly translated and consistently used. “Preentrenamiento,” “ajuste fino,” “aprendizaje por transferencia,” “ventana de contexto,” “ICL,” “anclaje,” and “memoria” are all accurate for a Spanish-speaking audience. Explanations accompany the terms as needed. No mistranslations detected.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, and cultural references are adapted appropriately. The conversational style is maintained, and the use of Spanish idioms (“hacer trampa”) fits the context. No major cultural missteps.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French text is present. No significant omissions or additions that alter meaning. The translation maintains concise, clear delivery while keeping necessary details.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is a solid, faithful rendition of the original French dialogue. It captures the technical concepts, maintains conversational flow, and uses appropriate terminology. Minor fluency tweaks would improve naturalness, but overall it is a high‑quality translation that would be well understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners."
