  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow, and the main ideas of pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are clearly explained. However, there are a few awkward phrasings (“por lo tanto se le dan las informaciones”, “bachoter para un examen”) and repetitive use of “por lo tanto” that slightly reduce clarity. Overall the text remains comprehensible but not perfectly polished.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The overall flow is natural for a Spanish speaker, but several sentences feel mechanical or contain small errors: the plural “informaciones” is not idiomatic, the repeated “por lo tanto” creates a choppy rhythm, and some clauses are oddly worded (“El aprendizaje en contexto es como repasar. Los conocimientos…”). These issues detract from a fully smooth, native‑level reading experience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are translated correctly (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, memoria a corto plazo). However, the abbreviation for In‑Context Learning was incorrectly rendered as “ACP” instead of “ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”, and the word “bachoter” (French) was used instead of the Spanish “repasar”. Inconsistent or wrong terminology lowers the overall quality.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The script’s intent and conversational tone are largely preserved. Cultural references are appropriate, but the translation could be slightly more idiomatic (e.g., avoiding the literal “por lo tanto” as a discourse marker and using more natural connectors). The adaptation is good but not fully optimized.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present, including the analogy of a graduate, transfer learning, the role of the context window, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No significant content is omitted, and the explanation remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the core concepts and maintains the conversational style of the original podcast. However, it suffers from a few lexical inaccuracies, awkward phrasing, and a mislabeled abbreviation, which together reduce the naturalness and precision of the text. With minor revisions—correcting terminology, smoothing repetitive sentence openings, and tightening phrasing—the translation could reach a highly polished, native‑level quality."
