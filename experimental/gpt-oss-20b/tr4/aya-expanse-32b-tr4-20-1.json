  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to read and the dialogue structure mirrors the original. Sentences are generally short and logical, making complex concepts clear. Minor awkwardness (e.g., *Ella olvida todo* or *Los conocimientos*) does not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The overall flow feels natural for a native speaker, with appropriate verb conjugations and idiomatic expressions. A few phrases are slightly literal or contain small grammatical slips (*Lo has entendido todo*, *Las nuevas* vs *Los nuevos*), but they do not disrupt the listening experience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely correctly rendered: *pre-entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje en contexto*. The only notable inconsistency is the use of the French word *ancrage* instead of the Spanish *anclaje*, and the abbreviation *ICL* is preserved. Overall, terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the original intent and tone, appropriately localizing expressions for a Spanish-speaking audience. The title *Tech Relámpago* preserves the lightning metaphor. Minor cultural adjustments could improve the feel but are not necessary.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential content from the original dialogue is present. No significant omissions or distortions are noted. The explanation of ICL and memory features is preserved, and redundancy is minimized while clarity is maintained.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful, clear, and readable. It conveys the technical concepts accurately and maintains the conversational style of the original. Minor adjustments—such as fully translating *ancrage* to *anclaje*, smoothing a few literal phrasings, and correcting minor gender/number mismatches—would bring the text to a fully polished level. Overall, it is a strong translation suitable for a professional audience of Spanish speakers interested in AI topics. 18/20 points earned across the board, with an overall score of 18/20 reflecting a well-executed translation with room for fine-tuning nuances of style and terminology consistency."
