  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is somewhat understandable, but it contains frequent language mix‑ups (e.g., using French words like “Donc”, “Luc:” as a separate speaker tag, or “Et soyoy Luc”). These interruptions break the flow and make it harder for a reader to follow the dialogue. However, the overall narrative can still be followed, especially by bilingual listeners.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation shows many awkward phrasing and grammatical errors (e.g., “Et soyoy Luc”, “Camille: Camille:”). It sounds uneven to a native Spanish speaker. Some parts are natural, but overall the text reads like a literal, machine‑generated draft rather than a polished script.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms such as *pre-entrenamiento*, *afinado*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *in‑context learning (ICL)*, *grounding*, and *memoria* are correctly translated. Nevertheless, the translation is inconsistent in naming the podcast (switches between *Tech Flash* and *Tech Éclair*) and occasionally repeats speaker tags incorrectly. Technical explanations are mostly preserved, but the term *apertura* for “fenêtre” is omitted or mistranslated in places.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The script’s intent is largely preserved, but several cultural nuances were lost or mishandled. The name switch for the podcast suggests a lack of careful adaptation. Also, some idiomatic expressions from French were left untranslated (e.g., “C’est logique”) or were rendered literally, which weakens the connection with Spanish‑speaking audiences. The overall tone remains conversational, but the local flavor could be improved.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Essential information is present: the distinctions between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, and memory are all mentioned. Minor omissions include the explicit mention of the “Mémoire” feature as an automated ICL system. However, the translation does not add unnecessary content, and redundancy is generally avoided. The core content is intact, though the errors might lead to misunderstandings.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is a rough, draft‑level effort. It preserves the main ideas but is marred by numerous language mix‑ups, grammatical mistakes, and inconsistent terminology. A thorough revision is needed to achieve a natural, fluent Spanish version that accurately reflects the original French script’s intent and tone. The biggest issues are the mixed use of French fragments, inconsistent speaker tags, and the confusing podcast name switch. Once these are cleaned up, the translation would read much more clearly and professionally for a Spanish audience. Overall, it scores below average and would benefit from careful editing and localization work to meet a high‑quality standard for broadcast‑ready content."
