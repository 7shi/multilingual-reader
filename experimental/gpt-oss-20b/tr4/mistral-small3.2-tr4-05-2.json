    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the dialogue format and overall logic of the original. Sentences are mostly clear and follow a natural flow. Some phrases (e.g., “por lo tanto”) are slightly literal but still comprehensible. However, a few long, compound sentences could be split for easier reading, especially for non‑technical listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads well for most native Spanish speakers, but there are several spots where the phrasing feels awkward or grammatically off. For example, “Lo han entendido todo” should be “Lo has entendido todo”, and “en un solo uso” is not idiomatic. Vocabulary choices are generally appropriate, yet occasional literal translations (e.g., “fin‑tuning” → “afinamiento”) feel a bit stiff. Overall, the text is fluent but could be polished.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding (anclaje). Explanations are retained where needed. Minor inconsistencies appear only in minor lexical choices but do not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone. Cultural adaptation is adequate: references to “consultor” and “profesor” fit Spanish contexts. However, some expressions could be more localized (e.g., “en un solo uso” → “una sola vez”). Overall, contextual adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French original is present. No major omissions or additions. The dialogue flows and covers the same points, including the discussion of ICL, fine‑tuning, grounding, and memory features. Redundancy is minimal.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and understandable, with good terminology handling and contextual fidelity. Minor grammatical and stylistic issues slightly lower the naturalness of the text. With some fine‑tuning, the Spanish version could reach a near‑perfect score. Overall, it effectively conveys the original content to Spanish‑speaking listeners while maintaining the conversational style of the podcast. The translation quality is high, but polishing would improve fluency and naturalness even further. The average score across criteria is 17.4 out of 20, reflecting a strong but improvable translation. The overall rating is 17 out of 20, indicating good quality with room for refinement."
