    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish transcript is generally clear and easy to follow. The conversational style is preserved, and most technical concepts are explained in a straightforward way. However, some sentences are a bit long and a few awkward phrasings (e.g., “Lo olvida todo” or “entre bastidores”) slightly hinder smooth comprehension. Overall, readers with a basic knowledge of AI can understand the content without major effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most parts and uses contemporary vocabulary. Minor issues include the use of “Lo olvida todo” instead of the more common “Se olvida de todo” and the phrase “entre bastidores” which is less idiomatic. Additionally, the inclusion of the French “c’est” in one line is a slip. These small glitches lower the naturalness, but the overall flow remains acceptable.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and context window are correctly translated and consistently used throughout the text. The abbreviation ICL is retained. The only minor deviation is keeping the word ‘prompt’ in English, but this is acceptable in a technical context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the informal, conversational tone of the original French podcast. Cultural references are appropriate for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve localization, but overall intent and purpose are preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French transcript are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No essential content was omitted, and redundancies were largely avoided. Minor omissions are negligible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and largely faithful to the original. It retains the conversational style and key technical concepts while making the content accessible to Spanish‑speaking audiences. However, a few linguistic polishings—especially around idiomatic expressions and punctuation—would elevate the quality to a more professional level. Overall, it is a competent translation that serves its intended purpose well."
