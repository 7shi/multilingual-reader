  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is clear and easy to follow. The sentences are generally logical and the dialogue format is preserved. Some minor phrasing feels slightly literal, e.g. \"Lo has entendido todo\" or \"Lo olvida todo\", but overall readers can comprehend the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly for native Spanish speakers. Most idiomatic expressions are appropriate and the grammar is correct. Occasional choices, such as \"Lo has entendido todo\" and the long, parenthetical sentence about a consultant, are slightly clunky but do not hinder understanding.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje\", \"memoria\". The translation preserves the original meaning and uses terms that are familiar to a Spanish-speaking audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects cultural nuances. The use of colloquial \"bachatear\" is a fitting adaptation for \"cramming\". The overall tone remains conversational and aligns with the original French script. Some long explanatory clauses could be shortened for brevity, but the adaptation is largely appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant content has been omitted. The Spanish version includes all details from the original, with no unnecessary additions. Redundancies are minimal, and the dialogue flow remains intact.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate, fluent, and well‑adapted to a Spanish-speaking audience. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve readability and naturalness, but overall the script preserves the intent, technical accuracy, and conversational tone of the original French version. A slight polish would raise the score to a near‑perfect level."
