  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and follows the logical flow of the original. Sentences are mostly short, making the script easy to follow for a general audience. Some phrases feel slightly awkward (e.g., \"partes de un contexto vacío\"), but overall the structure is coherent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds understandable to native Spanish speakers but contains occasional unnatural word choices and minor grammatical slips (e.g., \"afinamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\", \"discusiones\" instead of \"conversaciones\"). Punctuation and capitalization are mostly correct. The overall flow is smooth, yet not entirely idiomatic.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", \"memoria\". The translator stays consistent across the script. Some terms could be rendered more naturally (e.g., \"ajuste fino\"), but the chosen words are still appropriate for a general audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal, conversational tone of the podcast and respects cultural expectations of a Spanish-speaking audience. It retains the original structure and humor while making sure expressions are culturally appropriate. Minor adjustments could improve relatability, but overall adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present. No essential detail was omitted, and the translation includes the same explanatory segments. The only minor omission is a slightly less detailed explanation of \"fine‑tuning\" versus the original phrasing, but this does not materially alter the information conveyed.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation faithfully reproduces the content and tone of the original French script. It is comprehensible and largely accurate, though a few wording choices could be refined for greater naturalness. The translator maintained consistent terminology and captured all key information, making this a strong translation suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience. Minor stylistic polish would bring it to near‑perfect fluency and readability. Overall, the translation is of high quality and serves the intended purpose well."
