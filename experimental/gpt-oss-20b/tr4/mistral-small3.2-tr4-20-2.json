  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to read and follows a logical sentence structure. The dialogue format is preserved and the content is coherent. However, a few awkward verb choices (e.g. “Tienen todo claro” instead of “Lo tienes todo claro”) and some less natural phrasing (e.g. “partes de un contexto vacío”) slightly reduce clarity. Overall, readers can understand the message with minimal effort.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural to a native speaker, but several expressions feel stilted or incorrect. Phrases such as “Tienen todo claro”, “Cuando abres una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío” and the occasional use of “informaciones” instead of the singular “información” interrupt the flow. Additionally, some punctuation and capitalization issues slightly affect smoothness. The vocabulary is contemporary but could be refined for greater fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely retained correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “ICL”, “ventana de contexto”. Consistency is good, though the capitalisation of “Memoria” is inconsistent. The translation explains complex concepts adequately and provides contextual understanding. Minor issues with term usage do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The core intent of the original podcast is conveyed, and cultural references are largely appropriate for Spanish-speaking audiences. Some idiomatic choices could be better adapted (e.g. “consultor brillante” vs. “consultor destacado” or “experto permanente” instead of “experto permanente”). The adaptation is competent but could benefit from finer localization to fully resonate with the target culture.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all information from the French original is present in the Spanish translation. No major omissions are detected. The dialogue flows smoothly, and the context for each concept is maintained. Minor redundant wording was avoided, and the translation keeps the content concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid overall, accurately capturing the meaning and structure of the original French script. It delivers clear explanations of the AI concepts and preserves the conversational tone. Some grammatical slips and slightly unnatural phrasing reduce the polish of the text, but they do not significantly hinder comprehension. With minor refinements, especially in fluidity and idiomatic expressions, the translation would reach an even higher level of quality."
