  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, and the dialogue format preserves the original flow. However, several duplicated lines (e.g., “Luc: Luc:”), missing accents (“¿Porque” instead of “¿Por qué”), and abrupt phrase changes (e.g., “el modelo completo no aprende…” repeated) can momentarily confuse a native reader. Overall, most sentences are clear and logical, but these small errors lower the overall readability. 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly smooth, but there are noticeable instances of unnatural phrasing and grammatical inaccuracies: “afino” for fine‑tuning, “enlace al suelo” for grounding, and repetition of “Luc: Luc:”. These make the prose feel slightly stilted to a native Spanish speaker. 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are largely preserved, yet several are mistranslated or inconsistent: “afino” instead of “ajuste fino” or “fine‑tuning”; “AIC” used for ICL; “enlace al suelo” for grounding. This reduces clarity for readers unfamiliar with the terms. 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent of the podcast—explaining AI training concepts—is effectively conveyed. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is largely appropriate. Minor mis‑adaptations in terminology and phrasing are noted. 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the original French version are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and memory features. No substantive information is omitted, though a few lines are duplicated, which slightly inflates the length without adding value. 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the main concepts and conversational style of the original French podcast. However, several technical terms are incorrectly rendered, some phrases are awkward or duplicated, and missing accents create minor readability issues. With these corrections—especially for terminology and duplication—the text would read as a polished, native‑level Spanish translation. Overall, it demonstrates a solid grasp of content but falls short of perfect fluency and accuracy in technical language."
