  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely clear and follows a logical sentence structure. The narrator’s explanations are understandable even for non‑technical listeners. Minor issues such as the odd placement of “Ve o.” and the use of the plural “informaciones” instead of the singular “información” slightly disrupt the flow, but they do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences read smoothly for a Spanish speaker, but some are awkward. The phrase *Aprendizaje In‑Contexto* is not idiomatic, and the formal *Usted* contrasts with the informal *tú* used elsewhere. These stylistic inconsistencies reduce naturalness modestly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core terms (preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, grounding) are accurately rendered. The acronym for in‑context learning is incorrectly translated as AIC instead of ICL, and *Aprendizaje In‑Contexto* is not standard. Nonetheless, the terminology remains largely correct and consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the intended tone and keeps cultural references appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The only drawback is the inconsistent formality (Usted vs. tú). Otherwise, contextual adaptation is well handled.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are preserved. Small omissions (e.g., the nuance of the acronym ICL) are the only missing details, and they do not alter the overall meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation faithfully reproduces the content and is generally clear and fluent. Minor errors—incorrect acronym, non‑idiomatic phrasing, and a few grammatical slips—lower the polish but do not impede comprehension. With a few adjustments, the translation would be of high quality for a native audience.\n\nOverall, the translation is solid and largely effective for its purpose, requiring only minor refinements to reach perfection. The final score reflects an overall average across the evaluated criteria, resulting in a high‑quality translation suitable for broadcast or publication after light editing.\n\nScore: 18/20"
