  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is overall easy to read. Sentence structures are mostly natural and the dialogue flows well. Minor issues appear in a few long sentences where clauses could be split for clarity, but the content remains comprehensible for a general Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for native speakers. Most idiomatic expressions are correct and the vocabulary is contemporary. Occasional slightly awkward phrasing (“se tiene la impresión de que la IA se acuerda”) and minor punctuation choices do not impede understanding, but they do lower the fluency marginally.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated and appropriately explained: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, anclaje, ventana de contexto, memoria a corto plazo, etc. The translator keeps the original meaning while using terms that are familiar to Spanish‑speaking audiences. No important terms were omitted.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone. Cultural references remain appropriate, and the dialogue keeps the informal, conversational style of the French source. Adaptations to Spanish idioms are minimal but effective; the translation does not introduce culturally inappropriate expressions.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present. No significant information is omitted, and redundant details are avoided. The Spanish version delivers the same explanatory depth as the French text.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality. It maintains clarity, accuracy, and naturalness, with only minor stylistic refinements needed. The translator handled terminology and context well, delivering a faithful rendition that would be well received by Spanish‑speaking listeners."
