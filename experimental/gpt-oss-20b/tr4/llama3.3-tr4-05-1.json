    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and captures the casual conversational tone of the original. Sentences are mostly coherent, and the progression from pre‑training to fine‑tuning and ICL is clear. However, a few minor punctuation and word‑choice errors (e.g., missing accents in questions, awkward phrasing like “Tú has entendido todo”) slightly reduce readability for native speakers. Overall, the text remains comprehensible.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation flows well and uses contemporary vocabulary appropriate for a podcast audience. Some expressions are slightly unnatural or grammatically incorrect—such as “Tú has entendido todo” instead of “Tú lo has entendido todo”, and the lack of accent in “¿Porque” vs. “¿Por qué?”. These small issues detract from perfect fluency but do not impede understanding. The majority of sentences read smoothly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms like pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, grounding, ICL are correctly translated and consistently used throughout the text. The explanation of transfer learning and contextual learning remains faithful. The only minor inconsistency is the use of “triquiñuela” to mean trick, which is acceptable but could be replaced by a more common term such as “engaño” or “trampa”. Overall, terminology is handled well.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and humor, and adapts expressions to Spanish‑speaking audiences. Cultural references remain appropriate, and the narrative structure is intact. A few expressions could be slightly refined for local idiom, but the overall contextual adaptation is strong.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source—pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory features, and the consultant vs. expert analogy—are present. No substantive content is omitted. Minor stylistic changes do not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful and understandable, capturing the technical content and conversational style of the original French podcast script. Minor grammatical and punctuation errors—especially missing accents in questions and slightly awkward phrasing—reduce the overall polish. With small refinements, the translation would be near‑perfect."
