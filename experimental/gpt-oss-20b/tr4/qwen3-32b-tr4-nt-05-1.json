  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the overall structure and meaning of the original dialogue. The Spanish version is largely understandable to a native audience, with clear explanations of complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning. Minor issues—like occasional misplaced accents or slightly awkward phrasing—do not hinder comprehension. Overall, the readability is high, but a few grammatical slips slightly reduce clarity.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The prose is generally smooth and natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience, and most idiomatic expressions are appropriate. However, several small errors (e.g., “re aprender”, “de esta enfoque”, “una nueva enfoque”, “las nuevas conocimientos”) introduce awkwardness and occasionally disrupts the flow. Additionally, some gender/number agreement mistakes appear. These reduce overall fluency but do not severely impede understanding.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\". The main issue is the incorrect translation of the acronym ICL as AIC, which could confuse readers familiar with the English acronym. Other terminology remains consistent, and the level of explanation is suitable for a general audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original to Spanish culture appropriately, using familiar greetings and maintaining the conversational tone. The occasional mix of formal and informal pronouns (usted vs tú) is minor but noticeable. Cultural references are preserved, and no inappropriate or out‑of‑place expressions appear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No substantive information from the original is omitted. All key points—pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, memory features—are present. Minor grammatical mistakes do not lead to loss of meaning. The translation remains concise yet thorough.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is broadly faithful and understandable, capturing the spirit and details of the original French script. While most of the content is accurately conveyed, a few grammatical slips and a mis‑translation of an acronym slightly undermine the overall quality. With minor corrections, the translation would achieve a near‑perfect score."
