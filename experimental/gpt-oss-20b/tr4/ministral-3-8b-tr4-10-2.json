    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is overall understandable, with clear sentence structure and logical flow. However, some phrases (e.g., *“las informaciones”*, *“para la tarea a cumplir”*, *“se trata de que parece que la IA recuerda”*) sound slightly unnatural or awkward for native readers. Minor grammatical tweaks would improve clarity. Overall, readability is high but not perfect.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly in most parts and uses contemporary vocabulary. Nonetheless, there are a few instances of awkward wording (*“para la tarea a cumplir”*, *“se trata de que parece que la IA recuerda”*) and a slight mismatch of pronouns (*tus* vs *sus*). The occasional use of the original French word “ancrage” in a Spanish context disrupts the natural flow. Fluency is solid but could be refined.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are largely preserved: *preentrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL*. The term *fine‑tuning* is rendered as *afinado*, which is understandable but less common than *ajuste fino*. The mistranslation of *grounding* as the French *ancrage* instead of *anclaje* is a clear slip. Overall, terminology is mostly correct but not entirely consistent.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and cultural context, using idiomatic expressions suitable for Spanish-speaking listeners. Some adaptations (e.g., turning *“consultant”* into *“consultor brillante”*) work well. Minor phrasing choices could be smoother, but the adaptation is largely effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, short‑term memory, and the new memory feature. No essential information is omitted. A few explanatory details are slightly paraphrased but the core meaning remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material and conveys the intended meaning for a Spanish audience. While readability and fluency are generally good, occasional awkward phrasing and a terminology slip (retaining the French word *ancrage*) detract from a flawless result. With minor edits to wording and consistent use of Spanish technical terms, the translation would reach a high level of professional quality. Overall, it is competent but could benefit from refinement to achieve native‑speaker naturalness and terminological precision.\n\nOverall score: 16/20 (average of criteria)."
