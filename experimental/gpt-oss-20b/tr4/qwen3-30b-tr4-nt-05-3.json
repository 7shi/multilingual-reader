    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "I cannot evaluate readability without the actual translated text. I need to see how sentences are constructed, how well complex ideas are rendered, and whether the structure is logical for Spanish readers.",

    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Fluency assessment requires analysis of word choice, syntax, and idiomatic usage in the target language. Without the translation, I cannot judge naturalness or detect awkwardness.",

      "reasoning": "To judge technical terminology, I need to compare the French terms with their Spanish equivalents and see if the translation uses appropriate, consistent terminology and provides explanations when necessary.",

      "reasoning": "Assessing contextual adaptation involves examining how the translation handles cultural nuances and whether it maintains the original intent. I cannot do this without the text.",
