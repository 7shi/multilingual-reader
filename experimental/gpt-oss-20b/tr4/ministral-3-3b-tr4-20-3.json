  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is understandable in large parts, but several sentences are fragmented, incomplete, or left in French (e.g., “Camille: Je vois.”). This hampers comprehension, especially for a reader who does not read French. Sentence structure is generally coherent, yet some paragraphs contain abrupt transitions and missing verbs, which reduce overall clarity.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation exhibits many unnatural expressions and typographical errors (“Et soyoy Luc”, “C'est”, “Vous avez tout compris”). Grammatical mistakes such as mismatched gender or number, as well as the inadvertent insertion of French words, make the text feel disjointed and unpolished for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary choices are sometimes appropriate but are undermined by the overall awkwardness.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered (e.g., *pre-entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*). However, inconsistencies appear—sometimes the English acronym ICL is left untranslated, and phrases like “ventana de contexto” could be better expressed as “tamaño de contexto”. The translation does not consistently provide explanations or paraphrases where needed, and occasionally the term selection is off (e.g., *grounding* kept as “anclaje” without contextual clarification).",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original French script’s informal, conversational style is partially preserved, but the translation fails to fully adapt cultural references and idioms to Spanish‑speaking audiences. Mixed language fragments and literal transpositions of French phrases (“C’est là que intervient le concept d’ancrage”) weaken the contextual adaptation. The narrative intent is mostly preserved but feels less engaging.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The main ideas—pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and memory features—are largely present. However, several lines are incomplete or incorrectly translated, and some explanations are omitted or blurred (e.g., the discussion about “Mémoire” is cut off mid‑sentence). Redundancies are minimal, but the text could be more concise by removing stray French words and clarifying unfinished thoughts.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the core concepts of the original French dialogue but is marred by numerous linguistic errors, mixed-language fragments, and awkward phrasing. While the technical content is largely intact, the readability and fluency suffer, making the script less suitable for a polished, native Spanish audience. A revision that cleans up the language, ensures consistency in terminology, and fully adapts cultural expressions would significantly improve the quality and clarity of the translation. Overall, it is a rough draft rather than a finished, publication‑ready version. The combined average score reflects these issues, resulting in a moderate overall rating of 8.6/20. This indicates that substantial improvement is required to meet professional translation standards for a podcast transcript intended for Spanish listeners."
