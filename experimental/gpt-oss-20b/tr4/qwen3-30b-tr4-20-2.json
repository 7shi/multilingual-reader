  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is fragmented and contains many missing sections. Important parts of the dialogue are omitted, making it hard for a reader to follow the conversation. Even the existing sentences sometimes lack logical flow, which reduces overall comprehensibility.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are numerous grammatical inconsistencies and awkward constructions. Phrases such as \"El preentrenamiento\" (instead of the more common \"El preentrenamiento\" with accent), missing articles, and abrupt punctuation break the natural flow. The translation reads more like a rough draft than polished Spanish.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are either untranslated, misspelled, or used inconsistently. \"Preentrenamiento\" and \"afinamiento\" are acceptable but the translation fails to explain or contextualise terms such as \"ICL\" (Aprendizaje en Contexto) and \"grounding\". Some terminology is left in English without explanation, which may confuse readers.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation does not reflect the original tone or cultural context. Idiomatic expressions and colloquial references are either omitted or incorrectly rendered. The adapted version lacks the conversational nuance present in the French original, reducing the impact for Spanish-speaking listeners.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are missing, and several lines contain only placeholders or are entirely blank. Consequently, essential information and narrative continuity are lost, leading to a fragmented and incomplete text.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is severely incomplete and contains numerous linguistic and contextual errors. It fails to preserve the original meaning, flow, and technical accuracy, making it unsuitable for publication or direct use by a Spanish-speaking audience. Significant revision and supplementation are required to reach acceptable quality standards."
