  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, but the frequent insertion of pronunciation parentheticals, missing accents, and occasional misplaced punctuation interrupts the flow and makes the script harder to read. The core dialogue structure is preserved, yet some sentences feel disjointed or abruptly cut off.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several phrases feel literal and unnatural (e.g., \"¡Imaginate\", \"¡Entonces es una treta?\", \"¡Ella olvida todo.\"). Word choices such as \"treta\" instead of a more common \"trampa\" or \"artimaña\" and the mix of \"afinamiento\"/\"ajuste fino\" create a stilted tone. Overall the translation reads with noticeable rough edges and occasional grammatical oddities.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly correct: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\". However, the consistency of terms fluctuates (e.g., \"afinamiento\" vs. \"ajuste fino\"), and the translation of \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\" is accurate but could benefit from a brief explanation. Minor inconsistencies reduce the precision slightly.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally conveys the original intent and maintains the conversational tone. Yet some cultural nuances are lost: the playful French idiom \"c'est du bachotage\" is rendered as a direct comparison rather than a more idiomatic Spanish equivalent. The insertion of pronunciation notes, while informative, feels out of place for a native audience. The overall cultural adaptation is acceptable but not fully optimized.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. The extraneous pronunciation parentheticals add no substantive information but create redundancy. No critical content is omitted, and the dialogue remains largely faithful to the source.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the bulk of the content and keeps the structure intact, but it suffers from awkward phrasing, missing accents, inconsistent terminology, and intrusive pronunciation notes that detract from readability and naturalness. With careful polishing—removing the extraneous parentheticals, correcting accents, standardizing term usage, and smoothing idiomatic expressions—the script could reach a high‑quality standard for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Overall, it is usable but requires revision to be truly polished and engaging.\n\nOverall score: 13/20 (average of the five criteria)."
