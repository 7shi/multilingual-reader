  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely comprehensible, with a clear sentence flow that follows the original structure. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., *apresentarle* instead of *presentarle*) slightly interrupt the flow, but overall readers can follow the dialogue and grasp the concepts without much effort.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several awkward or non‑native expressions appear, such as *antisèche*, *apresentarle*, and the phrase *en la IA se le han proporcionado una antisèche justo antes*. These break the natural rhythm of Spanish. Moreover, the acronym *ICL* was incorrectly rendered as *ACP*, which feels forced. Consequently, the translation sounds somewhat mechanical in places.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered (*preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*). However, the acronym inconsistency (*ICL* → *ACP*) and the use of *anclaje* for *grounding* (acceptable but could be *fundamentación*) cause minor confusion. Overall consistency is good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue retains the original tone and informal register, suitable for a podcast audience. Cultural references are minimal, and no major cultural misalignments appear. Some phrasing could be more idiomatic to Spanish‑speaking audiences, but adaptation is largely adequate.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Essential content is preserved; no major omissions. Minor wording changes (e.g., *antisèche* instead of a clear equivalent) create slight ambiguity but do not drop critical information. Redundancies are largely avoided, and the translation stays concise.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the original material and preserves the conversational style of the podcast. It faithfully conveys the main ideas and technical terms, though a few linguistic inaccuracies and an acronym misstep slightly diminish fluency. With minor editorial tightening—especially correcting the acronym and replacing non‑native expressions—the translation would reach a high level of quality for native Spanish speakers."
