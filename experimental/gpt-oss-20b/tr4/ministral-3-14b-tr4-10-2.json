  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally easy to understand and follows a logical sentence structure. The dialogue flow is maintained and the explanation of complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning is clear. Minor repetitions and some slightly awkward phrasing (e.g., “Luc:” or “Camille:” appearing twice) slightly interrupt the reading rhythm, but overall the text is comprehensible for a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly sounds natural; however, there are noticeable irregularities: duplicated speaker tags, the mix of “vuestras” with “tú”, and occasional literal borrowings that feel a bit forced (e.g., “fine‑tuning” inserted in parentheses). These issues make some sentences feel clunky, but the overall flow is still smooth.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *anclaje*, and *memoria*. Inconsistent use of English labels (e.g., *fine‑tuning* versus *afinamiento*) and the occasional retention of English acronyms (*ICL*) could confuse readers who prefer a fully Spanish terminology. Nevertheless, the key concepts are accurately conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original tone and humor while adapting expressions to Spanish culture. The brand name “Tech Éclair” is preserved, which is acceptable. Minor adjustments (e.g., using “vuestra” for a collective audience) show some consideration of the target demographic, though a few phrasing choices could be more idiomatic. Overall, the intent and purpose of the original are effectively communicated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All substantive content from the original French version is present; the dialogue, explanations, and examples are retained. The only omissions are very small duplications of speaker tags that do not change meaning. No essential information is missing, and the text remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and delivers the core message accurately. Repeated speaker tags and a few awkward word choices slightly detract from readability and fluency, but these are minor editorial issues. The technical terminology is largely correct and consistent, and the cultural adaptation is appropriate. With minor polish, this version would be excellent for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The overall average score of 17/20 reflects a good but not perfect translation that would benefit from a final proofreading to eliminate repetitions and streamline phrasing."
