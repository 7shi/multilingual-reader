    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow, with most sentences kept short and the meaning of the original clear.  Minor issues arise with a few longer clauses (e.g., *‘Imagina que enviamos una IA completamente nueva a la escuela para darle una cultura general’*) that could be simplified, but overall the text is comprehensible for a general audience.  No major ambiguities or confusing structures are present.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for native Spanish speakers.  There are a few slightly awkward expressions such as *‘Lo han entendido perfectamente’* and the use of *‘cultura general’* in place of *‘cultura amplia’*, but these do not impede understanding.  Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary.  Overall, the text sounds natural with only minor idiosyncrasies.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "All technical terms are handled correctly and consistently.  *Pre-entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, and *aprendizaje en contexto* are all appropriate translations.  The Spanish version does not lose any technical nuance, and the terminology matches what a Spanish-speaking audience would expect.  No terms were omitted or mistranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and conversational tone.  Cultural references are adapted appropriately (e.g., *‘un recién graduado’* instead of *‘un joven diplomado’*), and idiomatic expressions are either maintained or suitably replaced.  The dialogue flows naturally for Spanish listeners, and the humor and metaphorical explanations are preserved.  Minor improvements could be made for even greater naturalness, but overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the original French script is present, including the detailed explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning.  No important points were omitted, and the translation does not add extraneous information that would detract from the original meaning.  The dialogue remains concise and clear, with no unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality: it preserves the meaning, tone, and technical accuracy of the original French script while producing a natural and readable Spanish version.  Minor fluency and readability tweaks could make it even smoother, but the current version effectively communicates the intended information to Spanish-speaking audiences.  Overall, it is a solid, faithful translation that serves its purpose well and would be easily understood by the target readers.  Minor style refinements could bring it to perfection, but it already meets a high standard for professional translation work."
