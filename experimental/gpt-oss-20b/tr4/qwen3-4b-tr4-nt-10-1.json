  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely comprehensible; the narrative flow mirrors the original French script, and explanations of concepts such as pre‑training and fine‑tuning are clear. Some sentences are long and a few could be split for easier digestion, but overall the target audience can follow the dialogue without confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most expressions sound natural, though a few phrases feel slightly mechanical. For instance, \"la IA no está constantemente afinada\" uses the masculine adjective \"afinada\" in a way that is uncommon; a more idiomatic phrase would be \"la IA no se afina continuamente\". Additionally, \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\" sounds awkward. Nevertheless, the overall flow is smooth and the vocabulary is appropriate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are translated correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", \"memoria\". The term \"fine‑tuning\" is rendered as \"afinado\", which is understandable but less conventional in Spanish; \"afinación\" or \"ajuste fino\" would be clearer. Terminology remains consistent throughout the text, and explanations accompany the terms where needed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references are minimal and thus translation does not require significant adaptation. The dialogue remains engaging for Spanish‑speaking listeners, with only slight variations in idiomatic phrasing that do not alter meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No significant content has been omitted, and redundancies were avoided while keeping the script concise. The translation faithfully represents the sequence of ideas and examples.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is overall high quality, successfully conveying the original script's clarity and intent. Minor issues in terminology and occasional phrasing affect fluency slightly, but the text remains understandable and engaging for native Spanish readers. With a few refinements, it would reach an excellent standard of translation quality."
