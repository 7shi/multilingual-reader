  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, but occasional mis‑articles (e.g., using \"u\" instead of \"una\") and missing accents (\"éclair\" vs. \"Éclair\") interrupt the flow. Paragraphs are well segmented and the conversational style is preserved, so a native reader can follow the narrative, but small errors may cause minor confusion.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the prose sounds natural for a spoken‑style podcast transcript, yet there are several awkward turns such as \"Aprendizaje en Contexto Interno\" and the repeated use of \"u\" where \"una\" is required. Grammar is mostly correct but the presence of these slips reduces the smoothness, yielding a moderate fluency score.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms (preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, memoria) are correctly translated and generally consistent. However, the term \"Aprendizaje en Contexto Interno\" is not standard; the more common \"aprendizaje en contexto\" would have been preferable. The terminology is therefore appropriate but could be tightened.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and conversational tone, and most expressions are culturally appropriate for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The program name \"Tech Éclair\" is preserved with its accent, which respects the brand identity. Minor cultural adjustments (e.g., phrasing of jokes or idioms) could be improved, but overall adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the French original is present; no major content was omitted or added. The explanation of concepts is retained and the back‑and‑forth between speakers is maintained. Redundancies were not introduced, and the dialogue stays concise, so the translation meets the completeness criterion well.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original meaning and maintains the casual, explanatory tone appropriate for a podcast. The main issues are small grammatical errors and some slightly unnatural terminology choices. With minor polishing—especially correcting the articles and refining a few technical expressions—the Spanish version would be considered a high‑quality translation suitable for a native audience. Overall, the work is competent but would benefit from a final proofreading pass to eliminate the remaining slips and to streamline terminology usage. Overall score: 14.6/20, rounded to 15/20 as an overall rating."
