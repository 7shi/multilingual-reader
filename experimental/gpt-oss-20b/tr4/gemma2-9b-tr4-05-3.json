  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version largely preserves the conversational flow and is understandable for native readers. However, the inclusion of an untranslated French phrase (“Telle est la réalité du ICL”) and a few awkward constructions (e.g., “el afianzamiento”) detract from clarity. Overall, the text remains comprehensible but could be smoother.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The majority of the sentences read naturally, but some word choices feel literal or uncommon in Spanish. ‘Afianzamiento’ is not the standard term for fine‑tuning; ‘ajuste fino’ would be clearer. Similarly, ‘fundamentación’ for grounding is awkward. Minor grammatical slips also appear, slightly reducing overall fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, etc. The translation of 'grounding' as 'fundamentación' and 'fine‑tuning' as 'afianzamiento' are imprecise. Consistency is largely maintained, but some terminology could be improved for accuracy.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator largely sticks to literal rendering, preserving the original intent. Cultural adaptation is minimal, and the unexpected French phrase indicates a lapse in localization. The overall intent is preserved, but better cultural tailoring and elimination of untranslated text would enhance adaptation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original is present; the content is not missing. The accidental insertion of a French sentence does not omit meaning, but it does break the continuity. No unnecessary redundancy was added, and the translation stays concise and clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the main ideas accurately and maintains the conversational tone. Strengths include faithful rendering of most technical concepts and logical sentence structure. Weaknesses lie in occasional literal word choices, an untranslated French phrase, and some awkward terminology. With minor revisions—particularly correcting ‘afianzamiento’ to ‘ajuste fino’, using a better term for ‘grounding’, and removing the French fragment—the translation would be polished and fully natural for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Overall, the quality is solid but requires fine‑tuning for a professional finish. The average score is 15/20, indicating good competence with room for improvement in precision and localization detail. "
