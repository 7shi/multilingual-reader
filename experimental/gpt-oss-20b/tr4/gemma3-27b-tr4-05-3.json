  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely comprehensible, with clear sentence structures and logical flow. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a lay reader can follow. Minor readability issues arise only from a few literal constructions that slightly interrupt the natural rhythm.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall, the translation reads smoothly and sounds natural to native Spanish speakers. Some phrases (e.g., *‘sería increíblemente ineficiente’* or *‘se ha vaciado su espacio de trabajo temporal’*) are slightly literal and could be phrased more idiomatically. Nonetheless, the vocabulary is appropriate and the style remains conversational, matching the original podcast tone.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, and *Memoria* are all accurate and consistent. The abbreviation ICL is preserved, and no key terminology is omitted. The translation provides adequate explanations when necessary, keeping the language accessible to a general audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent while adapting expressions to Spanish idioms. The explanation of ICL as memorizing for an exam is a good cultural adaptation. Minor cultural nuances (e.g., “consultor brillante” vs. “consultor experto”) could be refined, but overall the contextual adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential points from the French source are retained: the stages of learning, the comparison between fine‑tuning and in‑context learning, the memory feature, and the final takeaway about temporary vs. permanent knowledge. No significant information is omitted, and the content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is strong and faithful to the original French script. It communicates the technical concepts clearly and preserves the conversational tone of the podcast. Minor fluency tweaks would elevate it to near‑perfect readability and naturalness, but as it stands, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience who is familiar with AI terminology. Overall, it merits an 84/100 score, indicating a professional translation with only slight room for polish in style and idiomatic expression. If used as a final draft, a brief proofread focusing on the few literal passages would render it flawless."
