  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The early part of the translation is clear and easy to follow, but halfway through the text a large portion is left in French instead of Spanish. This makes the overall readability difficult because readers must switch languages abruptly. Minor grammatical errors (e.g., missing accent in \"¿Porque\") and occasional awkward phrasing also detract from smooth reading.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text generally sounds natural and the vocabulary choices are appropriate for a casual podcast transcript. However, there are several unnatural expressions (e.g., \"Lo has entendido todo\" could be \"Lo has entendido todo.\"), missing accents, and the abrupt switch to French breaks the flow. These issues lower the overall fluency.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", and \"in-context learning\" are correctly translated and consistently used. The Spanish version also provides adequate explanations where necessary. Nevertheless, the missing French sections mean that some terminology from those sections is not represented at all.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone, and it adapts idiomatic expressions appropriately for Spanish listeners. The missing portions, however, fail to convey the intended context for those sections, weakening the overall contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Significant chunks of the original transcript are omitted and left in French. This constitutes a major omission of information, reducing the completeness of the translation. Additionally, some small details (e.g., missing accent marks) further reduce fidelity.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation displays a solid grasp of most technical terminology and maintains a conversational tone, but it suffers from a critical omission where large sections of the text remain untranslated into Spanish. This not only hampers readability and fluency but also compromises the informational integrity of the transcript. A comprehensive revision is needed to replace the remaining French passages with accurate Spanish and to polish the minor linguistic issues present in the translated portions. Until those corrections are made, the translation should be considered incomplete and requiring substantial improvement. Overall score: 12/20."
