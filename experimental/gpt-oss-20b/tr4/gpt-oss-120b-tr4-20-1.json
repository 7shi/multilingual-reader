  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well-structured, and the progression from pre‑training to ICL is logical. Some minor awkwardness appears in a few phrases (e.g., \"la IA no se afina constantemente con sus conversaciones\"), but overall readers can comprehend the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for native Spanish speakers, using appropriate vocabulary and syntax. However, a few expressions are slightly unnatural or redundant: \"la IA no se afina constantemente\" could be \"la IA no se entrena continuamente\", and \"la IA no ha «olvidado»\" might read more smoothly as \"la IA no ha olvidado\". Overall, the text is fluent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\" for grounding, and \"Memoria\" for the new feature. The translation retains the original acronyms (ICL) where appropriate. No key terms are omitted or mistranslated.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapted the opening greeting and maintained the show’s branding. Cultural references are appropriate, and the language suits a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor opportunities exist for further localization (e.g., using \"aplicación\" instead of \"ventana\" in some contexts), but the intent and purpose are effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, and memory features. No essential content is missing, and the translation does not add unnecessary fluff.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, accurately conveying technical concepts and the conversational tone of the original. Minor refinements in fluency and phrasing could elevate it to near-perfect, but it already stands as a clear, natural, and faithful rendition."
