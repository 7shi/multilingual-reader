    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly understandable and follows a logical sequence. However, the repeated speaker labels (e.g., “Luc: Luc:”), missing speaker tags on several lines, and occasional abrupt word‑level mistakes (e.g., *aprenderán* instead of *aprende*) interrupt the flow and may confuse readers. Overall, the content is comprehensible but not perfectly smooth.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are several grammatical slips and unnatural word choices: *podéis* used instead of *puedes* in a singular context, *una forma astucia* instead of *una forma astuta*, missing accents, and the duplicated speaker label (*Luc: Luc:*). While native speakers can largely parse the sentences, the awkward phrasing and errors diminish the naturalness of the translation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered: *pre-entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *anclaje*, *ventana de contexto*. Minor issues include the slightly off translation of *memory feature* as *funciones de memorización* and the generic term *identidad* for *model’s identity*, but overall terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, but the duplicated speaker labels and occasional literal renderings (e.g., *aprenderán francés* instead of *aprende francés*) reduce cultural fluency. The Spanish version is understandable for a francophone‑speaking audience, but some colloquial touches that might resonate better with Spanish listeners are missing.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No substantive content is omitted; the conversation flow is preserved and all key points are present. However, missing speaker tags on some lines could lead to ambiguity about who is speaking, slightly reducing clarity. Redundancies are minimal, but the text could be tightened further.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is generally faithful and conveys the core ideas of the original French podcast. Nonetheless, it suffers from several typographical and grammatical errors, inconsistent speaker labeling, and a few awkward phrasings that affect readability and naturalness. With a few editorial corrections—removing duplicate speaker tags, fixing verb agreement, and polishing the syntax—the translation would reach a high level of quality suitable for native Spanish listeners. The technical terminology is handled correctly, and the contextual adaptation is mostly effective, but a more polished final edit would strengthen the overall clarity and fluency of the text."
