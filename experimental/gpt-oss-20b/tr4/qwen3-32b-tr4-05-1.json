    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to follow. The sentence structure mirrors the French, and complex ideas are kept understandable. Some sentences feel slightly mechanical (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto es un aprendizaje memorístico”) and could be phrased more fluidly, but overall the text is readable for a general audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation sounds natural and smooth. However, there are a few minor issues: the phrase “Lo has entendido todo” feels abrupt, “el aprendizaje en contexto es un aprendizaje memorístico” is a literal but awkward rendering, and the use of the English word “prompt” in a Spanish context could be replaced by a fully Spanish equivalent. These small slips lower the fluency slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “pre-entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje en contexto” and “anclaje” are appropriate choices. The term “prompt” is left in English, which is common in AI discourse, but a fully Spanish equivalent could improve consistency. Overall, terminology is clear and consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone. Cultural references are not heavily modified, but the overall meaning is conveyed effectively. Some expressions could be more idiomatic (e.g., “una antisèche” could be translated more naturally), yet the adaptation is largely successful.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present. No substantive omissions were detected, and the translation adds no extraneous content. Minor wording choices might alter nuance slightly, but the core information is intact.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and faithful to the source text, with clear and accurate conveyance of technical concepts. Minor improvements in phrasing and terminology consistency could raise the quality further, but it already serves its purpose for a Spanish-speaking audience of similar technical background to the original French audience. The occasional literal or slightly awkward phrasing does not undermine overall comprehension, making this a strong translation overall. The calculated average score is 17.4/20, reflecting good quality with room for minor refinements. The translation is suitable for most professional or academic settings, though some stylistic polishing could enhance naturalness and readability for a wider audience. Overall, a solid effort that successfully balances fidelity and readability while maintaining a clear, engaging narrative voice. The translation meets the key criteria well, with most scores above 16, indicating solid performance across readability, fluency, terminology, contextual adaptation, and completeness, albeit with some small room for improvement in flow and idiomatic expression. This makes the overall quality high but not perfect, earning an 17.4/20 score. This evaluation is based on a detailed assessment of each criterion, taking into account linguistic accuracy, clarity, naturalness, and fidelity to the source text. The translation is well-suited for the target audience, with only minor adjustments needed for full naturalness and stylistic polish."
