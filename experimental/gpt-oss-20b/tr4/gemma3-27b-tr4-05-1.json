  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version keeps the original structure largely intact and explains complex concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL, grounding) in a straightforward way. Sentences are generally long but understandable, and the dialogue flows logically. Minor minor wordiness in a few spots does not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker, but some phrasing is too literal: \"Se hace posible\" repeats too often, \"Se hace una\" feels awkward, and \"Se puede decir eso\" would sound better as \"Se puede decir que\". The word choice for technical terms is fine, yet a few sentences could be re‑phrased for better rhythm.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"memoria a corto plazo\". Consistency is maintained throughout. No major mistranslations or omissions.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the intent and conversational tone. Cultural adaptation is adequate, though some expressions are still very literal. The Spanish audience would understand the references without confusion, and the humor/analogies translate well.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French text is present: the discussion of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No key detail is omitted, and the narrative remains concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is strong in conveying content, terminology, and overall clarity. It could benefit from smoothing out some literal phrasing to improve naturalness. It achieves a solid balance between faithfulness and readability, making it suitable for a general Spanish‑speaking audience."
