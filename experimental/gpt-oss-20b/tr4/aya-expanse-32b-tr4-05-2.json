  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and easy to follow. Sentences are generally concise and the dialogue format helps comprehension. Minor issues such as the phrase \"El aprendizaje sigue un proceso muy real\" (instead of the more natural \"El aprendizaje sigue un proceso muy real\") and the use of \"partes\" instead of \"parte\" in the sentence about a new window slightly reduce clarity, but they do not prevent understanding. Overall, the text is readable for a general Spanish-speaking audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward repetitions and stylistic choices. The term \"ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\" is redundantly stated, and the capitalization of \"Memoria\" is unconventional. The phrase \"El aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\" is clunky. Despite these issues, the overall flow is smooth for native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\" for grounding. However, there is an inconsistency: the translator switches from \"ajuste fino\" to \"afinamiento\" later on, which could confuse readers. Aside from that, terminology is accurate and consistent within each segment.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, adapting cultural references appropriately (e.g., \"Tech Relámpago\" for \"Tech Éclair\"). The dialogues feel natural for a Spanish audience. Minor stylistic choices, such as the capitalized \"Memoria\" and the slightly literal phrasing of \"El aprendizaje sigue un proceso muy real\", are the only points that slightly detract from a fully polished adaptation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present in the Spanish version: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No significant content was omitted, and the translation avoids unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality overall. It conveys the content accurately, uses appropriate terminology, and maintains the conversational tone. Minor fluency and consistency issues are present but do not impair comprehension. With some smoothing of repetitive phrasing and terminology alignment, the translation could reach near‑perfect standards."
