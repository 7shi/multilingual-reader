  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the clear, step‑by‑step explanation of AI concepts. Sentences are generally short and logical, making it easy for a native reader to follow. The occasional duplication of speaker labels (\"Luc: Luc:\") and a few missing commas slightly disrupt the flow but do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall, the translation reads smoothly and uses contemporary vocabulary. Some expressions feel slightly mechanical (e.g., \"se inserta automáticamente esos fragmentos en el prompt, detrás de escena.\") and the repetition of speaker labels suggests a copy‑editing oversight. These issues lower the naturalness marginally.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "All technical terms are correctly rendered: *preentrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning* (ajuste fino), *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL*, *anclaje*, *memoria*. The terminology is consistent throughout the text and aligns with common Spanish AI lexicon.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references adequately – phrases like \"se da la impresión\" or \"parece\" would be natural in everyday Spanish. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., keeping the English acronym ICL) reflect the target audience’s familiarity with international terms. Overall, the intent and purpose are well preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No substantive content is omitted. All key points from the original – pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, memory features – are present. The duplicate speaker label is a formatting error rather than an omission of meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, accurately conveying the original content with clear explanations and proper technical terminology. Minor copy‑editing errors (duplicate speaker labels, occasional mechanical phrasing) detract slightly from readability and fluency, but overall the Spanish version serves its purpose for a native audience. It would benefit from a brief proof‑read to remove duplicated labels and smooth out a few phrasing nuances, after which it would be virtually indistinguishable from a professional translation crafted from scratch for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The text successfully maintains the original's educational intent while using language that is accessible and engaging for listeners of \"Tech Éclair\" in Spanish."
