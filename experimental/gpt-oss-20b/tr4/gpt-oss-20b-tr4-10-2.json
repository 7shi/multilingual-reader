  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and follows the original dialogue structure. Some sentences feel slightly abrupt or omit the subject (e.g., \"Lee una cantidad…\"), and the repetition of the *Luc:* line makes the flow a bit confusing. Nonetheless, the overall narrative remains clear.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward phrasing and grammatical slips such as \"Cuando abre una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío\" (should be \"parte\") and the duplicated line. Vocabulary is appropriate but some expressions could be smoother.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *anclaje*. Minor inconsistencies (e.g., leaving *ICL* untranslated) are present, but overall consistency is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent of the original is preserved and the dialogue style fits Spanish-speaking audiences. Cultural references remain neutral, but the duplicated line and a few literal translations slightly reduce the natural adaptation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original script are included; no substantive content is omitted. The duplication of the *Luc:* line is the only redundancy that could be considered a minor issue, but it does not affect overall understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and comprehensible, with a few grammatical and stylistic errors that do not undermine the main message. Refining sentence flow, correcting minor repetitions, and smoothing a few phrases would elevate the quality to near-native level. The technical terminology is well handled and consistent, and the overall content is faithful to the source text. Minor improvements in fluency and contextual adaptation would make it an excellent translation for Spanish-speaking listeners of the podcast."
