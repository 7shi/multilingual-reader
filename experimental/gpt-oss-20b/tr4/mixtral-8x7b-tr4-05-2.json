  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is heavily cluttered with bracketed notes, duplicated speaker labels, and incomplete sentences. Many lines end abruptly and contain explanatory comments that are not part of a coherent Spanish narrative. As a result, a Spanish‑speaking reader would struggle to follow the dialogue and understand the flow of ideas. This severely hampers readability.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains numerous unnatural expressions (e.g., \"prompt\", \"I.C.L.\", repeated speaker tags) and awkward grammar. Sentences such as \"Luc: Luc:\" or \"Luc: Luc:\" are clearly errors. The overall cadence of the Spanish text does not feel natural to a native speaker, making the text sound stilted and disjointed.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Some technical terms are correctly translated (e.g., \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"aprendizaje de transferencia\"). However, others are either incorrect or inconsistent (e.g., \"ajuste fine\" instead of \"ajuste fino\", and the mix of English and Spanish for terms like \"prompt\"). The terminology handling is therefore only moderately acceptable.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation does not adapt the original French cultural references or idiomatic expressions to Spanish equivalents. The inclusion of explanatory notes and literal translations of non‑native constructs leaves the target audience with a sense of a literal, bookish text rather than a natural, culturally relevant dialogue. Adaptation is therefore minimal.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All original lines are present in some form, and no major semantic content is omitted. However, many sentences are incomplete or interspersed with notes that could confuse readers. The overall information conveyed is complete, but the delivery is cluttered.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is far from ready for publication. It contains numerous structural and linguistic errors, awkward terminology usage, and an overabundance of explanatory notes that disrupt flow. A revision that removes the notes, corrects grammar, unifies terminology, and adapts expressions for a Spanish‑speaking audience would be necessary to achieve a usable, high‑quality translation.\n\nOverall score: 6/20 (average of the five criteria). This reflects that, while the information is largely intact, readability, fluency, terminology consistency, and contextual adaptation need substantial improvement.\n\nThe scoring reflects the need for a clean, natural, and coherent Spanish rendition that fully respects the source material’s intent and the target audience’s expectations. A professional rewrite is strongly recommended before use in a podcast or any public-facing material.  \n\nScore: 6/20"
