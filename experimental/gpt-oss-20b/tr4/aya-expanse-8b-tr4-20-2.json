  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentence structures mirror the original and complex concepts are explained in a straightforward way. Some sentences are long, but overall the narrative is clear and logical.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural for most parts, but there are several awkward phrasings such as \"se borra su espacio de trabajo temporal\" and the final line \"¡Hasta pronto para el próximo episodio de 'Tech Luz'!\", which reads unnatural and disrupts the flow. These issues lower the overall fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly – \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", \"memoria\" – and are consistent throughout. Only minor stylistic choices (e.g., “In-Context Learning” to “Aprendizaje en Contexto”) might be refined, but they are accurate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts well to Spanish-speaking audiences. Cultural references are preserved and the dialogue flows naturally. However, changing the brand name to \"Tech Luz\" deviates from the original and may confuse listeners, which slightly diminishes contextual fidelity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present. The only omission is the incorrect brand name at the end. No essential content is missing, and redundancy is avoided, keeping the translation concise and clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely accurate and readable, conveying the original content’s meaning and intent. It does well with terminology and maintains the conversational tone. However, minor fluency issues and a key branding mistake detract from perfect execution. Addressing these points would elevate the translation to a near-perfect level for native Spanish audiences. Overall, a solid but improvable job of translation quality.  "
