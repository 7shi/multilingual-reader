  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable; the sentence structure is logical and the dialogue format is clear. Minor grammatical hiccups (missing articles, inconsistent capitalization) do not severely impede comprehension, but they do affect readability.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several awkward or unnatural phrases such as \"la IA no se ajusta constantemente con sus conversaciones\", \"una astucia?\", and occasional capitalization errors (e.g., \"Ajuste fino\"). These reduce the natural flow for a native Spanish speaker, though the overall meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly translated: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", \"memoria\". However, the abbreviation for in‑context learning is incorrectly rendered as \"AIL\" instead of the expected \"ICL\", and the term \"ajuste fino\" is inconsistently capitalized. These inconsistencies diminish terminology precision.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and cultural tone of the original French podcast are preserved. The dialogue feels natural in Spanish, but some idiomatic choices (e.g., \"una astucia?\") and the misuse of abbreviations slightly weaken contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French source are present; no major content is omitted. The translation adds a few explanatory comments (e.g., explaining the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge) that help the target audience. Redundancy is minimal, though some phrasing repeats concepts slightly.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is generally faithful and comprehensible, but it suffers from several issues that affect fluency and terminological accuracy. Minor editorial corrections (fixing abbreviations, improving idiomatic phrasing, and cleaning up grammatical inconsistencies) would bring the translation to a higher standard. Overall, it meets the basic objectives but would benefit from a thorough proof‑read to polish the naturalness and precision of technical terms and expressions."
