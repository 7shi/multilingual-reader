    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and follows the logical flow of the original French transcript. Most sentences are easy to understand and the concepts are explained in a straightforward manner. Minor issues arise with a few awkward phrasings (e.g., \"Cuando abres una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío\") that slightly hinder smooth reading, but overall comprehension remains high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, some expressions feel slightly literal or uncommon in everyday language – for instance, using \"afinado\" for \"fine‑tuning\" and the phrasing \"las informaciones que parecen relevantes\" could be refined to \"las informaciones pertinentes\". These small quirks slightly lower the overall fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anchoring\" translated as \"ancoraje\", etc. The only notable inconsistency is the use of \"afinado\" versus the more common \"ajuste fino\" for fine‑tuning, but this does not create confusion. The terminology is appropriate for a general Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references are minimal and translated appropriately. The speaker dynamics are maintained. A few small idiomatic adjustments could improve cultural resonance, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French transcript is present in the Spanish version. No key details are omitted. The translation is concise, and while there are minor redundancies (e.g., repeating the concept of context in two slightly different ways), the content remains clear and comprehensive.",
      "score": 19
    },
