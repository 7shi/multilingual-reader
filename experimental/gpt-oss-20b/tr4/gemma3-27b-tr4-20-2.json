  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation uses clear sentence structures and avoids overly complex constructions, making the content easy to understand for a general audience. Technical concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in straightforward terms. Minor areas of slight ambiguity (e.g., “una memoria” instead of “una antisèche”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally for Spanish speakers. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary, and grammatical constructions are mostly smooth. A few awkward phrasings appear (e.g., “se le ha proporcionado una memoria” and “se abre una nueva ventana”), but they do not detract from overall flow.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: pre‑training → pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning → ajuste fino, in‑context learning → aprendizaje en contexto, grounding → anclaje. Explanations accompany terms where needed, and the terminology aligns with common Spanish usage in AI contexts.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original intent and tone. Cultural references are adapted appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The conversation remains informal yet informative, matching the original podcast style. The adaptation is smooth, with no significant loss of nuance.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French source is present. No significant content is omitted, and redundancy is largely avoided. The translation retains the explanatory examples and clarifications, ensuring the audience receives the same level of detail as in the original.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the original content while maintaining readability and naturalness. Minor stylistic adjustments could further polish the text, but overall it meets professional standards for accurate and engaging translation of technical podcast dialogue into Spanish."
