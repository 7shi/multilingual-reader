    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable for native speakers and conveys the main ideas of the original dialogue.  Some sentences are a bit repetitive (e.g., repeated use of *por lo tanto*) and a few longer constructions feel slightly awkward, which can interrupt the flow.  Nevertheless, the overall structure remains clear and the meaning is preserved.  Score: 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads relatively smoothly but contains several moments of unnatural phrasing.  For example, *una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado* sounds a bit clunky, and the mix of English terms (*grounding*) within the Spanish text can be jarring.  Some verbs are slightly mis‑chosen or in the wrong tense.  The vocabulary is mostly appropriate and contemporary, but these small issues lower the naturalness of the text.  Score: 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento* (fine‑tuning), *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto* and *aprendizaje en contexto* are correctly rendered and consistently used.  The translation also explains concepts in simple language when needed.  The only minor issue is the occasional retention of the English word *grounding* in parentheses, which could be replaced with *anclaje* alone for consistency.  Overall, terminology handling is solid.  Score: 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue’s intent is preserved and the conversational tone is maintained.  Cultural references are generally appropriate, but some expressions (e.g., *una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado*) feel slightly formal and less idiomatic for everyday Spanish.  Adapting such phrases to more natural Spanish could improve the cultural resonance.  Score: 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original appear in the Spanish version.  The explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning is intact, and the discussion about memory features is fully represented.  No significant omissions are present, and the text avoids unnecessary repetition.  Score: 19/20.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and largely faithful to the original.  It conveys the technical concepts and the conversational style well, though a few phrases feel slightly unnatural or redundant.  With some fine‑tuning of word choice and sentence structure, the text could achieve a higher level of fluency and readability.  Overall, it is a solid translation that would be well understood by Spanish‑speaking listeners or readers of the podcast transcript."
