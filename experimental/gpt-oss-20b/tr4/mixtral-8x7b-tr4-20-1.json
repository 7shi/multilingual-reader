  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows a logical sentence structure that mirrors the original French script. However, the inclusion of numerous parenthetical pronunciation notes (e.g., *The pronunciation in Spanish would be …*) interrupts the flow and can confuse readers who expect a straightforward transcript. Minor grammatical errors such as missing accents (pre-entrenamiento) and slightly awkward phrasings (e.g., *para darle una cultura general*) also detract from complete clarity. Overall, readability is good but could be improved by removing extraneous notes and correcting small typos.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation displays a fairly natural Spanish style, but several expressions feel mechanical or slightly off: *afinamiento* is uncommon (more usual: *ajuste fino*), the phrase *ella olvida todo* is acceptable but could be smoother, and the punctuation sometimes deviates from typical Spanish usage (missing accents, inconsistent comma placement). The presence of the pronunciation notes also interrupts fluency. Nevertheless, the text reads smoothly enough for a native audience, so fluency earns a moderate score.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre-entrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *context window* (*ventana de contexto*), *grounding* (*anclaje*), and *in‑context learning* (*aprendizaje en contexto*) are translated correctly and consistently. The choice of *afinamiento* instead of *ajuste fino* is understandable but less idiomatic. Overall, terminology is appropriate and clear, giving this criterion a solid score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation respects the original intent, using Spanish equivalents for cultural references and maintaining the conversational tone. The show name is translated to “Tech Claridad”, which preserves the brand while localizing it, though the original “Tech Éclair” could also have been kept for consistency. Some phrasing could be more idiomatic, and the inserted pronunciation comments are unnecessary for a typical Spanish audience. Despite these minor issues, contextual adaptation is well handled.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory vs. temporary knowledge, and the final conclusion. No critical content is omitted. The only extra material are the pronunciation annotations, which do not affect information integrity but add redundancy. Therefore, information completeness is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers the core content accurately and is largely comprehensible to Spanish‑speaking listeners. The presence of pronunciation notes and some non‑idiomatic phrasing reduce readability and fluency, but technical terminology and contextual intent are preserved. With minor editing—removing extraneous notes, correcting small typos, and refining a few expressions—the translation could reach a higher level of polish and naturalness."
