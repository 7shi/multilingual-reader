  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and follows the logical flow of the original dialogue. The sentences are generally short, and the use of parentheses to explain terms aids comprehension. Some minor consistency issues (e.g., \"pre-entrenamiento\" vs \"preentrenamiento\") slightly hinder readability, but overall readers can grasp the concepts without confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for native Spanish speakers. There are occasional awkward phrasing, such as the repeated \"Aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en contexto)\" and the use of \"se apoya en fundamentos extremadamente sólidos\" which feels a bit literal. However, these do not significantly disrupt the natural flow of the dialogue.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are appropriately translated: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", etc. The terminology remains consistent throughout the text, and explanations are provided where needed. Minor issues include the occasional literal use of \"in-context learning\" as \"aprendizaje en contexto\", but this is a valid and widely understood translation.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content to a Spanish-speaking audience by using familiar expressions and maintaining the podcast tone. Cultural references are preserved, and the dialogue feels suitable for listeners in Spanish-speaking regions. A few phrasing choices could be optimized for idiomatic Spanish, but overall the intent and purpose are effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French transcript is present. The Spanish version includes the same explanations, examples, and analogies. No significant content has been omitted, and the dialogue remains concise without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and largely faithful to the source material. Minor issues with consistency and occasional awkward phrasing do not undermine the overall quality, which is fluent, technically accurate, and well adapted to Spanish listeners. With a few fine‑tuning adjustments, it would be near‑perfect for a native audience."
