    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version largely follows the sentence structure of the original and presents the ideas in a comprehensible way.  The narrative flow is preserved and most concepts are clearly explained.  However, several typographical errors and awkward punctuation (e.g., duplicated speaker labels “Camille: Camille:”, “Et soyoy Luc.”) interrupt the reading rhythm.  These issues slightly lower the overall clarity for a native Spanish reader.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences read smoothly, but there are noticeable grammatical slips and unnatural word choices: \"Et soyoy Luc.\" should be \"Y soy Luc.\"; \"una astuta forma de aprendizaje contextual automatizado\" is clunky; some verb conjugations feel forced (e.g., \"la IA no se ajusta constantemente a tus conversaciones\").  The overall register remains conversational, but these errors detract from naturalness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally handled well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", \"Memoria\".  The translation consistently uses the Spanish equivalents and occasionally provides brief explanations.  Minor inconsistencies appear (e.g., the occasional retention of the English term \"Fine‑tuning\"), but overall terminology is accurate and suitable for the intended audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and humor, and most cultural references are preserved.  Yet there are lapses in adapting brand names (switching between \"Tech Flash\" and \"Tech Éclair\") and a few literal phrasings that feel less idiomatic.  These irregularities slightly reduce the cultural resonance of the final product.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Essential information from the French script is retained; the dialogue content and explanations are largely intact.  Minor repetition (duplicated speaker tags) and small omissions (none significant) are present, but they do not affect comprehension.  Overall, the translation conveys the full message without unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material and effectively conveys its core ideas.  However, typographical mistakes, some awkward phrasing, and inconsistencies in naming diminish the polish.  With minor revisions to correct errors and refine naturalness, the text would achieve a high‑quality standard."
