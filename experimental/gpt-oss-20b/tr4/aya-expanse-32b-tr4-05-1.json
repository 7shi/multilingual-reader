  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and logical, using simple sentence structures that allow native readers to understand the concepts without difficulty. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in an accessible way, with analogies that help comprehension. Minor sentences could be slightly tightened, but overall readability is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a Spanish speaker. Vocabulary choices are contemporary and appropriate. Some minor awkward phrasings exist – e.g., \"para convertirla en una especialista\" feels slightly literal, and \"la IA la utiliza para esa única conversación\" could be smoother – but they do not impede understanding. Overall, the flow is smooth and natural.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are translated correctly and consistently: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\". Explanations accompany each term where needed. The use of \"anclaje\" for \"grounding\" is acceptable. No significant mistranslations or omissions of key terms.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts well to Spanish-speaking audiences, using culturally relevant expressions such as \"consultor brillante\" and avoiding overly literal phrasing. The overall intent of the original is preserved, and the dialogue remains engaging. Minor cultural tuning could be added, but the current version is already well adapted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original is retained. No key points are omitted, and the dialogue flow remains intact. Redundancies are minimized, and the translation stays concise while keeping the content clear. Minor details such as the explanation of the ICL abbreviation could be expanded, but this does not detract from completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation demonstrates high fidelity to the original French script. It is clear, fluent, technically accurate, and culturally adapted. Only a few minor refinements would bring it to perfection, but it is already of excellent quality and ready for publication or broadcast to a Spanish-speaking audience."
