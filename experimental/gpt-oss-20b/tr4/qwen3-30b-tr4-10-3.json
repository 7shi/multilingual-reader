  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is generally easy to read for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but numerous blanks and incomplete sentences hinder comprehension. The missing portions of dialogue make it difficult to follow the conversation flow, especially in the middle sections where several lines have been omitted entirely. Additionally, occasional literal word choices (e.g., \"las mismas informaciones\") sound awkward and may confuse readers. Despite these gaps, the sentence structure that is present is mostly clear and logical.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains a number of unnatural expressions and grammatical errors. For instance, phrases like \"Si quiero que ella tenga conocimiento de las mismas informaciones mañana\" are clumsy, and the use of plural \"informaciones\" is rarely done in Spanish. Moreover, several lines are left in French (e.g., \"Exactement\"), which breaks the natural flow for a Spanish audience. The overall rhythm of the dialogue feels disjointed due to these issues, reducing the naturalness of the text.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje\", \"memoria a corto plazo\". However, the abbreviation ICL is not explained, and some terms such as \"grounding\" are translated as \"anclaje\" but without the contextual explanation. The terminology is consistent where present, but the omissions diminish its overall quality.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to adapt several cultural and linguistic nuances. French interjections like \"Exactement\" remain untranslated, and there is no effort to adjust idiomatic expressions for Spanish speakers. The speaker labels are sometimes missing, and the dialogue flow is broken by omissions. This lack of adaptation reduces the effectiveness of conveying the original intent to a Spanish audience.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Significant portions of the original dialogue are missing from the translation, including several speaker turns and key explanatory sentences. The resulting text lacks completeness and may leave listeners confused about the progression of ideas. Although some supplementary explanations were attempted (e.g., describing memory mechanisms), the overall omission of content results in a less informative translation.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation demonstrates a solid grasp of technical terminology but suffers from numerous omissions, untranslated French fragments, and awkward phrasing that compromise readability and fluency. The missing dialogue sections severely affect information completeness, making it difficult for a Spanish audience to fully grasp the discussion. While the core concepts are present, the translation requires substantial revision to meet the quality expected for a professional, native‑speaking audience. A more thorough proof‑read, complete dialogue reconstruction, and cultural adaptation would greatly improve the final product.\n\nTotal Score: 55/100 (13+11+15+9+7)."
