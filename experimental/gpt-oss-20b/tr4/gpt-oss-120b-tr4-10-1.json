  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally easy to follow, with clear explanations of the technical concepts. Sentences are short and the dialogue structure is preserved. However, the accidental repetition of “Luc: Luc:” and a few missing accents (e.g., *é* in *“La IA no se afina…”) slightly hinder comprehension. Overall, readability is high but not perfect.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text flows well in most places, but there are several instances of awkward phrasing such as *\"El propio modelo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus conversaciones\"* which feels literal. The use of *intercambios* instead of *interacciones* and the literal translation of *“bastidores”* contribute to a slightly stilted tone. The repeated speaker label (*“Luc: Luc:”*) is a clear error that interrupts the naturalness. Fluency is acceptable but has room for polish.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are accurately rendered: *preentrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *anclaje*. Consistency is maintained throughout the text. The occasional use of the English term *fine‑tuning* is acceptable in technical contexts. No major terminology mistakes are present, so the score is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation stays true to the original intent, keeping the conversational style and the informal tone. Cultural adaptation is adequate; idiomatic expressions are not over‑translated and the Spanish equivalents are natural for a general audience. Minor adjustments could improve localization, but overall the context is well adapted.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French source is present. The dialogue structure is maintained, and no substantive content is omitted. The duplicated speaker label is a formatting issue rather than an omission. Redundancy is minimal and the translation remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and conveys the original content accurately, with clear technical explanations and a faithful dialogue format. Minor issues such as duplicated speaker labels, occasional literal phrasing, and a few missing accents slightly detract from fluency, but the overall quality is good. With some proofreading and refinement of the most awkward sentences, the translation would achieve a higher fluency score."
