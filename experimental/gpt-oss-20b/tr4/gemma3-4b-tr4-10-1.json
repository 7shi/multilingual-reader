    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version retains most of the original meaning and the overall dialogue structure is recognizable. However, the repeated speaker tags (e.g., \"Camille: Camille:\"), missing commas, and broken sentence fragments reduce the ease with which a native reader can follow the conversation. Some phrases are awkward or incomplete, which can hinder comprehension, especially for complex ideas such as ICL versus fine‑tuning.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains several unnatural or incorrect expressions: duplicated speaker labels, incomplete clauses, and a mix of French and Spanish words (e.g., \"pre-entrenamiento\" is fine, but \"fine‑tuning\" is left untranslated while earlier the translation used \"ajuste fino\"). These issues disrupt the flow, making the translation feel mechanical rather than natural. A smoother, fully localized version would read more fluently.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are largely present (pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, ICL, grounding, memoria). Nonetheless, the translation shows inconsistency: sometimes the English term \"fine‑tuning\" is kept, sometimes \"ajuste fino\" is used. The term \"grounding\" is rendered as \"anclaje\" but without the explanatory note present in the original. Overall, the terminology is understandable but could be more consistent.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to keep the conversational tone and cultural references, but the heavy presence of French speaker tags and the lack of adaptation for Spanish-speaking audiences (e.g., not simplifying expressions for a general audience) weakens contextual adaptation. Minor adjustments (e.g., using more idiomatic Spanish expressions) could improve it.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The core information from the original is largely preserved. However, duplicated lines and occasional omissions (e.g., missing explanation of \"grounding\") slightly reduce completeness. Redundancy from repeated speaker tags also adds unnecessary clutter.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the general meaning but is hampered by structural errors, duplicated speaker tags, and inconsistent terminology. While the essential content is present, the readability and fluency suffer, making the text less accessible to a native Spanish audience. A thorough cleanup—removing duplicates, standardizing terminology, and polishing phrasing—would greatly enhance quality."
