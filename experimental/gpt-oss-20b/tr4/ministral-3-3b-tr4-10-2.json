  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally understandable, but the frequent interjection of French words (e.g., *C’est logique*, *C’est une excellente remarque*) interrupts the flow. Sentence structure is mostly correct, yet some fragments feel fragmented (e.g., *Luc: Luc:*). These issues reduce the overall ease of reading for a native Spanish audience.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains many awkward phrasings, unnatural word choices, and duplicated words (*Luc: Luc:*). The mix of languages further disrupts naturalness, and some sentences feel abrupt or incomplete (*C’est une excellente remarque, y compris crucial entender cómo funciona esto*). Overall, the fluency is limited.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms such as *pré-entrenamiento* (pre‑training) and *ajuste fino* (fine‑tuning) are used, but the translation alternates between *afinado* and *ajuste fino* without consistency. The term *grounding* is correctly rendered as *anclaje*, and *In‑Context Learning* is adequately explained. Minor inconsistencies and occasional untranslated words (e.g., *prompt*) do not severely compromise comprehension, but consistency could be improved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains several French expressions and even a couple of mixed‑language sentences, which undermines cultural adaptation. While some culturally neutral explanations are provided, the lack of full Spanish equivalents for phrases like *C’est logique* weakens the overall contextual fit for Spanish listeners.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The bulk of the original content is present, including the main dialogue and explanations. However, there are duplicated lines (*Luc: Luc:*), missing transitions, and a final line that mistakenly references *Tech Éclair* instead of *Tech Flash*. These omissions and redundancies slightly affect completeness but do not obscure the main points.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the main ideas but is marred by language mixing, repeated words, and occasional incomplete sentences. While the technical concepts are largely preserved, the fluency and contextual adaptation need significant refinement. A more rigorous proof‑reading and consistency check would raise the quality substantially."
