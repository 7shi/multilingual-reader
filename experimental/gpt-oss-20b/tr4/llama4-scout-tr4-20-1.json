    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and easy to follow. Most sentences are straightforward, and the overall narrative structure mirrors the original. The few inserted commentary fragments (“Here is the translation:” and the “or” alternatives) slightly disrupt flow but do not impede comprehension for a native speaker.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall, the translation sounds natural and fluent. However, certain expressions feel slightly mechanical or redundant – e.g., “Eso es un truco” followed by “o Es un truco entonces” – and the use of the word “trampa” is uncommon in this context. Minor punctuation inconsistencies also affect smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are retained accurately: pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje (grounding). The terminology is consistent throughout and matches the target audience’s expectations.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, and adapts idiomatic expressions suitably for Spanish listeners. The occasional insertion of explanatory “or” options and the “Here is the translation:” note are not part of the dialogue, slightly weakening contextual cohesion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present, with no significant omissions. The extra meta commentary lines add redundancy but do not remove essential information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the technical content and conversational style of the original French. Minor issues of naturalness and redundant editorial notes detract slightly from fluency and coherence, but the overall clarity, terminology accuracy, and contextual adaptation remain strong. A final polish to remove extraneous commentary and streamline some awkward phrasing would bring the translation to near‑perfect level."
