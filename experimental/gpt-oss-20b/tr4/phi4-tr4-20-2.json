  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to follow. Sentences are short, the dialogue is natural, and the concepts are explained clearly. Only a few phrases—such as the introduction of “AIC (Aprendizaje In‑Contextual)”—are slightly confusing because the abbreviation is not previously explained, but the overall flow remains comprehensible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor awkwardness appears in the phrase “Aprendizaje In‑Contextual” and in the repetition of the word “anclaje” in parentheses. The use of “se acuerda” instead of “recuerda” is acceptable but slightly informal. Overall, the language is natural and appropriate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto. The term “AIC” is introduced without explanation, which may confuse readers, and “Aprendizaje In‑Contextual” is not standard. Nevertheless, the essential terminology is accurate and consistent throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal conversational tone of the original French dialogue and adapts idiomatic expressions to Spanish equivalents. Cultural references (e.g., “el podcast donde desciframos la tecnología”) are appropriate. Minor stylistic improvements could be made, but the overall intent is well conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present. No significant content is omitted, and the dialogue remains coherent. The only slight issue is the unexplained abbreviation “AIC,” but this does not compromise understanding.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the original dialogue while maintaining natural fluency and clear terminology. Minor adjustments—especially regarding the introduction of abbreviations—would elevate it to perfection. Overall, it is an effective and engaging adaptation for Spanish‑speaking listeners."
