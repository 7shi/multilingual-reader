  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation presents clear, mostly logical sentence structures and explains complex ideas in an accessible way. A few small awkward phrasings (e.g., \"Lo has entendido todo\" and \"Así que es una memoria de uso único\") slightly reduce readability but do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text generally flows naturally for a Spanish speaker, though some expressions are a bit literal or abrupt (e.g., missing exclamatory punctuation, \"Lo has entendido todo\"). These do not significantly hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" and \"afinamiento\" for fine‑tuning. Explanations where necessary are retained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects cultural norms—greetings and idiomatic phrases fit a Spanish-speaking audience. Minor enhancements (e.g., exclamation marks) could improve the tone, but the intent remains clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential content from the original is preserved with no significant omissions. Redundancy is minimal and the overall meaning stays intact, though a small phrasing change could improve conciseness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful, clear, and technically accurate. Minor stylistic and grammatical quirks slightly reduce naturalness, but they do not hinder understanding of the original message."
