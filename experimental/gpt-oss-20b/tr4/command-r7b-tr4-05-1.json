  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely comprehensible, but several grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures—such as missing articles, mis‑placed accents, and literal translations of English terms—slightly hinder the flow. The overall meaning is retained, yet the reader occasionally has to reread sentences to grasp the intended nuance.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural expressions (“promoción” for “prompt”, “en backstage”, “aprender en contexto interno”) and inconsistent verb conjugations. These errors disrupt the natural rhythm for native speakers, lowering the fluency score.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered (preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto). However, the translation of ICL as “Aprendizaje en Contexto Interno” and the use of “anclaje” for grounding are less conventional, creating slight confusion. Overall, terminology is handled fairly well.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation to a Spanish‑speaking audience is adequate in general, but several literal translations and the retention of English terms in quotes (e.g., “grounding”) dilute the cultural adaptation. Some idiomatic expressions could have been localized better.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All core content from the original French script is present. The translation does not omit significant details, and the dialogue flow is maintained. Minor redundancies appear due to literal phrasing but do not compromise clarity.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation communicates the main ideas but suffers from a number of linguistic inaccuracies and unnatural phrasings that affect readability and fluency. Technical terminology is mostly preserved, yet some terms are rendered in less conventional ways. The adaptation to the Spanish audience could be smoother, particularly in the use of idiomatic expressions and correct terminology. Overall, the translation is functional but would benefit from careful proofreading and localization to achieve a more polished, native‑like result."
