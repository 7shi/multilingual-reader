    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally easy to follow and most concepts are clearly presented. However, a few sentences feel slightly awkward (e.g., \"Es como contratar a un consultor brillante…\" and the repetition of \"Ella olvida todo\"). Minor grammatical slips such as \"esas conocimientos\" also slightly hinder readability. Overall, readers can understand the content without significant effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish is mostly natural and idiomatic, but several phrases are somewhat clumsy or contain small errors. Phrases like \"Lo has entendido todo\" are fine, but the use of the plural \"informaciones\" instead of the singular \"información\" in some contexts, and the inconsistent use of exclamation marks, detract from a completely smooth flow. The overall register is appropriate, but the text could benefit from a more polished style.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, and *ICL* are correctly translated and consistently used. The translation captures the nuances of the concepts and does not introduce erroneous terminology. A minor issue is the capitalization of \"Memoria\" as a feature name, but this is a stylistic choice rather than a term error.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation preserves the original intent and tone. The cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish-speaking audience. The main misstep is the erroneous translation of the show’s title from \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Tech Luz\", which could confuse listeners familiar with the original name. Aside from that, the dialogue flow and contextual references are well maintained.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French transcript is present in the Spanish version. No critical details were omitted, and the structure mirrors the source text. The translation does not add unnecessary repetition, and the content remains concise while covering all key points.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful and comprehensible, with solid terminology handling and a clear conveyance of the original dialogue. Minor issues—particularly the incorrect show title, occasional grammatical slips, and slightly awkward phrasing—prevent it from reaching perfect fluency. With some fine‑tuning, especially in polishing the narrative flow and correcting the title, the translation would be excellent for a native Spanish audience."
