  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentence structure mirrors the original and key concepts are explained in a straightforward manner. Minor issues arise with repetition and slightly awkward phrasing, but overall readers can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker. There are a few phrases that feel slightly unnatural or could be polished (e.g., \"Se podría decir eso.\" or \"el modelo en sí no aprende ni evoluciona\"), yet the overall flow is natural and the grammatical construction is correct.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\" as \"afinado\", \"transfer learning\" as \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"In‑Context Learning\" as \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" as \"ancoraje\". Terminology is consistent throughout, and key concepts are briefly explained where necessary.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation respects cultural and linguistic expectations. The translation maintains the conversational tone and idiomatic expressions suited to a Spanish audience. Small adjustments could improve naturalness, but overall the intent of the original is effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French script is present. No significant omissions are detected, and the translated text avoids unnecessary redundancy. The addition of a few clarifying phrases (e.g., \"ventana de contexto\") aids understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality. It preserves the meaning, technical accuracy, and conversational tone of the original French script. While a few sentences could be slightly refined for greater naturalness, the translation remains clear, faithful, and appropriate for the target audience. Minor polishing would bring it to a near‑perfect standard, but it already functions well in a real‑world podcast context.\n\nOverall, the translation demonstrates strong linguistic competence and a solid understanding of the technical content, making it accessible to Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\nScore: 17/20"
