  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely understandable to a Spanish-speaking audience, but several typographical errors (e.g., *posibla*), missing accents, and awkward phrasing interrupt the flow. Sentence structure is mostly correct, yet some sentences are clunky (e.g., *Cuando usted afinan un modelo…*). Overall, the text can be followed but feels somewhat strained, earning a 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains multiple grammatical mistakes, inconsistent verb forms, and unnatural word choices that hinder a native speaker's sense of fluency. Phrases like *es posibla* or *para quien utiliza estos herramientas* break the natural rhythm. The overall fluency is therefore modest, scoring 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *in‑context learning* (translated as *aprendizaje en contexto*) are used correctly. Some terminology inconsistencies appear (e.g., *afinado* vs. *fine‑tuning*), but overall the specialist vocabulary is appropriately handled, meriting a 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and maintains a conversational tone suitable for a podcast. However, cultural nuances are not fully optimized; some expressions feel literal rather than naturally Spanish (e.g., *¡Gracias por habernos escuchado*). The adaptation is acceptable but could be refined, thus 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present, with no significant omissions. Minor redundancies appear but do not obscure meaning. The translation is comprehensive, earning an 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation communicates the core ideas but is hampered by typographical errors, grammatical inconsistencies, and occasionally awkward phrasing. While the terminology and intent are largely preserved, the text would benefit from a careful copy‑editing pass to improve readability and fluency, and to polish the cultural adaptation for a native audience. With those corrections, the translation could reach a high level of quality suitable for a professional podcast script. Overall score: 72/100 (36/50 after weighting each criterion equally)."
