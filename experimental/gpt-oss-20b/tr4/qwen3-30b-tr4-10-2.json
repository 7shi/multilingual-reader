  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is understandable in general, but several lines are missing or incomplete, which forces readers to fill gaps mentally. Sentence structures are mostly coherent, yet some phrases like \"para darle una cultura general\" feel slightly awkward. The overall flow is disrupted by abrupt transitions caused by omissions. Therefore the readability is acceptable but not optimal.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains many syntactic and lexical issues: missing articles, wrong prepositions, and some stilted phrasing (e.g., \"El preentrenamiento\" instead of \"El preentrenamiento\" with an article). There are also missing lines that break the natural rhythm of the dialogue. As a result, the translation sounds uneven and occasionally unnatural to a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"memoria a corto plazo\" are generally correct. However, some preferred alternatives (e.g., \"ajuste fino\" for fine‑tuning) are missing, and terminology is not consistently applied across the text. The use of \"Memoria\" to refer to user‑session memory is correct but could be clarified. Overall, terminology is fairly accurate but could be improved for consistency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to adapt cultural references, but several expressions (e.g., \"consultor temporal\") feel literal. Contextual nuances from the original French, such as the rhetorical emphasis on the contrast between temporary and permanent learning, are not fully conveyed due to missing lines. Consequently, the adaptation is somewhat adequate but lacks depth and some local flavor.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A significant portion of the original dialogue is omitted or left blank, resulting in gaps in the narrative. Key points—such as the explanation of the new \"Memory\" feature and the concluding remarks—are either missing or incomplete. This leads to a clear loss of information, making the translation less informative than the source. The completeness score reflects these omissions.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is incomplete and contains several grammatical, lexical, and structural errors. While the core concepts are largely recognizable, missing sections and awkward phrasing compromise the overall quality. A thorough revision is needed to ensure clarity, consistency, and completeness, and to make the dialogue flow naturally for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The translation would benefit from a complete rewrite of omitted parts, careful attention to idiomatic expression, and consistent use of technical terminology. Overall, the translation is acceptable as a draft but requires significant improvement before publication or presentation to a native audience. The total score reflects an average performance of 55 out of 100 points, indicating room for substantial enhancement."
