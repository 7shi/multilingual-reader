    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. The sentences are short and the logical flow mirrors the French script. Minor issues arise with repetition of certain phrases (e.g., *aprendizaje en contexto*) and occasional literal word‑for‑word translations that make a sentence feel slightly clunky, but overall a Spanish reader can grasp the concepts without confusion.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for native Spanish speakers. Grammatical structures are correct, and the vocabulary feels contemporary. Some choices such as *chuleta* for *cheat sheet* introduce a colloquial flavor that fits informal podcast dialogue. The only slightly awkward part is the inconsistent capitalization of *Aprendizaje In-Context*, but this does not impede fluency.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are appropriately rendered (e.g., *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *anclaje*). However, there is inconsistency: *In-Context Learning* is sometimes translated as *aprendizaje en contexto* and other times as *Aprendizaje In-Context*. A uniform choice would improve clarity. Nonetheless, the chosen terms are understandable for the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and adapts cultural references well. Phrases like *consultor brillante* and the colloquial *chuleta* resonate with Spanish-speaking listeners. No cultural misunderstandings are introduced, and the overall tone remains conversational, which suits a podcast format.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French script is preserved. No sections are omitted, and explanations are provided where necessary (e.g., describing the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge). Redundancies are minimal, and the content stays concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is strong overall, conveying the original meaning with good readability and natural flow. Minor issues include occasional repetition and inconsistent terminology. With small refinements—particularly standardizing the translation of *In-Context Learning*—the text would reach near‑perfect quality for a Spanish‑speaking audience of podcast listeners. The translation effectively balances technical precision with conversational clarity, making it suitable for its intended purpose and audience context.\n\nOverall Score: 17/20\n  "
