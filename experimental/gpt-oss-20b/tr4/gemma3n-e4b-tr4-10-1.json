  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable for a general audience, with clear sentence structures and logical flow. Some sections (e.g., “se le proporcionó una libreta de consulta justo antes de que empezara a hablarte”) feel a bit clunky, slightly hindering readability, but overall comprehension remains high.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the translation preserves most meanings, several phrases sound unnatural to native Spanish speakers (e.g., “se le proporcionó una libreta de consulta justo antes de que empezara a hablarte”, “se le proporcionó una libreta de consulta”). There are also minor grammatical slips such as missing accents and inconsistent article usage, which detract from a fully smooth reading experience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly—‘pre‑entrenamiento’, ‘ajuste fino’, ‘aprendizaje por transferencia’, ‘aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)’, ‘anclaje’—and are consistently used. The translation also provides brief contextual explanations where appropriate, which aligns with the expected comprehension level of the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and the podcast’s branding. Cultural references are minimal and thus translate directly. However, some idiomatic nuances (e.g., “con el enfoque de aprendizaje en contexto” versus the original “learning in context”) could be fine‑tuned to better resonate with Spanish‑speaking listeners, but overall adaptation is satisfactory.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French source are present in the Spanish version. The dialogue is reproduced in full, and no essential content is omitted. Redundancy is minimal, and the text remains concise while preserving clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the core information accurately. Minor improvements in natural phrasing and consistency would elevate it to a higher level of quality. It serves well for a Spanish‑speaking audience but could benefit from smoothing some awkward constructions and ensuring fully natural idiomatic usage."
