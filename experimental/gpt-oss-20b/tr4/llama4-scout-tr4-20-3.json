    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but several sentences are awkwardly constructed or incomplete (e.g., \"Es la diferencia entre una conocimiento\"), which may confuse readers. The overall structure follows the original but lacks some clarity in transitions. Score: 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many expressions feel unnatural to a native speaker. Phrases such as \"Es una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\" or the insertion of English fragments like \"Here is the translation:\" disrupt the flow. Some verbs are incorrectly conjugated or gendered. Score: 10/20.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core terms are mostly correct – \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\" – but there are inconsistencies (e.g., \"ICL\" left untranslated) and occasional mis‑wordings. Technical precision is generally maintained, but a few terms lack the expected nuance. Score: 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the conversational tone and cultural references (e.g., greetings, rhetorical questions). However, some idiomatic expressions are not fully adapted, and a few sentences remain too literal. The target audience’s cultural context is respected but could be improved. Score: 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The majority of the original content is present, but there are extraneous English notes (e.g., \"Here is the translation:\"), slight omissions in explanatory detail, and occasional redundancies. Overall, the key information is conveyed, yet the translation could be cleaner. Score: 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material and technical terms, yet it is marred by grammatical inaccuracies, awkward phrasing, and stray English commentary. The text is generally intelligible, but it would benefit from a thorough proofreading to ensure naturalness, consistency, and a clean presentation suitable for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The overall quality is acceptable but requires refinement to reach professional standards."
