    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text largely follows the original structure and is comprehensible, but the repeated speaker tags such as \"Luc: Luc:\" and \"Camille: Camille:\" create confusion and interrupt the flow. Some long sentences are broken awkwardly by inserted tags, which hampers smooth reading. Overall, the content is understandable but could be cleaner.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation reads naturally, yet there are a few syntactic oddities and the duplicated speaker labels interrupt the rhythm. Phrases like \"Lo has entendido todo\" and \"Se puede decir eso\" are acceptable but a few awkward wordings and missing accents (e.g., \"entonces\" missing accent) slightly lower fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\", and the acronym ICL is introduced. The terminology remains consistent throughout the transcript. Minor style choices (e.g., keeping the English term \"ICL\" in italics) could be more explicit, but overall the technical language is appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, using a conversational style suitable for a Spanish-speaking podcast audience. Cultural adaptation is minimal but adequate; the phrase \"empollarse para un examen\" is a natural Spanish idiom that conveys the intended meaning. No major contextual misunderstandings are present.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key points from the original are present, including the distinctions between pretraining, fine‑tuning, ICL, grounding, and the memory feature. No critical information is omitted. Minor duplications of speaker tags do not remove content but do add redundancy.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers a faithful and largely comprehensible rendition of the original French dialogue into Spanish. The main issues arise from repetitive speaker tags and a few syntactic slips that slightly affect readability and fluency. Terminology is well handled, and the contextual intent remains intact. With minor editorial polishing—removing duplicated tags, smoothing a few phrasing choices—the translation would reach a high standard of clarity and naturalness for native Spanish speakers listening to a podcast about AI training methods. Overall, the work is strong and only needs light refinement to achieve professional quality."
