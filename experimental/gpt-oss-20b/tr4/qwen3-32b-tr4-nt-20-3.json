    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish transcript is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are not overly complex, and the dialogue structure mirrors the original. However, a few long sentences (e.g., “La IA no ha 'olvidado' en el sentido humano del término; simplemente se ha vaciado su espacio de trabajo temporal.”) could be split for smoother reading. Overall readability is good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds largely natural to a Spanish speaker, but there are some noticeable awkwardities and inconsistencies. The abbreviation for In‑Context Learning is mistakenly rendered as “AIC” instead of “ICL” or “ICL (In‑Context Learning)”, which breaks the flow. Phrases such as “es una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado” feel clunky, and the repetition of “la IA” in several consecutive sentences could be varied. These issues lower the fluency slightly.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are handled correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “grounding” → “anclaje”. The only major slip is the abbreviation mismatch for ICL. Otherwise, terminology is consistent and suitable for the target audience, with no misleading translations.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the original intent and tone, but some culturally specific adaptations are missing. For example, the phrase “imagina que le enviamos una nueva IA a la escuela” is literal; a more idiomatic version might be “imagina enviar a una IA recién creada a la escuela”. Additionally, the Spanish version does not exploit idiomatic expressions that could make the dialogue feel more native. These omissions reduce contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory functions, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No significant content is omitted. Minor redundancy (e.g., repeated explanations of forgetting) is acceptable for clarity.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the gist of the original podcast with good fidelity and generally readable prose. However, it suffers from a few technical inaccuracies (especially the abbreviation for In‑Context Learning) and some awkward phrasing that affect naturalness. With minor revisions to terminology consistency and smoother sentence construction, the translation would reach a higher quality level suitable for native Spanish-speaking audiences."
