  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally comprehensible for native speakers, especially those familiar with tech podcasts. However, the numerous parenthetical pronunciation notes (written in English) interrupt the flow and make the script feel disjointed. Some sentences are also quite long, which can be hard to follow when spoken aloud. Overall, the readability is acceptable but could be improved with cleaner paragraphing and removal of non‑essential commentary.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation frequently uses unnatural expressions (e.g., \"La IA no está constantemente ajustada por tus conversaciones\") and retains English words such as \"prompt\" without Spanish equivalents, which interrupts naturalness. The tone is somewhat informal but the mixture of English parentheticals and inconsistent capitalization makes the text feel robotic. Native readers would find some phrasing clunky. Fluency therefore scores modestly.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved: preentrenamiento, afinamiento (ajuste fino), aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, etc. The translation stays true to the original terminology and provides a brief contextual explanation when necessary. Minor inconsistencies appear (e.g., using \"prompt\" instead of \"instrucción\"), but overall terminology handling is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The script’s intent as a conversational podcast is maintained. Cultural references are minimal, but the inserted pronunciation notes and English fragments detract from the localized flavor. The dialogue remains true to the original, yet some adaptation could improve relatability, especially for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Score reflects these mixed aspects.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are present in the Spanish version, including the discussion of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, and the concept of memory. However, the extraneous pronunciation notes add unnecessary information that does not belong to the source text. Removing these would preserve completeness while improving conciseness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is fundamentally accurate in terms of content and terminology, but it suffers from stylistic and structural issues. The inclusion of English pronunciation notes and occasional awkward phrasing hinder readability and fluency. With minor edits—removing parenthetical commentary, smoothing sentence structure, and ensuring consistent Spanish terminology—the script would be much more natural and engaging for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Overall, the translation is passable but needs refinement to reach a professional quality level for a podcast audience. "
