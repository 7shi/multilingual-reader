  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The first two thirds of the Spanish translation are readable and follow logical sentence structure, but the final third is left in French, which makes it incomprehensible for Spanish‑speaking listeners. The presence of French fragments creates a significant break in readability and requires the reader to switch languages. Minor issues such as a missing question mark after “Porque ya entiende los conceptos generales …” and the incorrect article in “una conocimiento” also reduce clarity. Overall, readability is severely compromised by the untranslated portion, resulting in a low score.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Where the text is in Spanish, the syntax is mostly correct, yet there are occasional awkward constructions (e.g., “proporcionarle los documentos de información exactos que necesita”) and a mix of French words (e.g., “ancrage” and the whole block of French after the analogy). The mixture of languages disrupts the natural flow expected of a fluent Spanish text, lowering the fluency score.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as preentrenamiento, afinamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, and grounding (translated as ancrage) are correctly identified and used. However, the untranslated French segment contains technical wording that Spanish listeners cannot grasp, and the translation of grounding could be “anclaje” for consistency. Overall, terminology handling is good but incomplete, yielding a moderate score.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The script’s conversational tone and cultural references are largely preserved, and the Spanish version mirrors the original French’s intent. Yet the failure to translate a significant portion of the dialogue into Spanish disrupts contextual adaptation, as the audience cannot follow the narrative. This omission lowers the effectiveness of the adaptation.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A substantial portion of the dialogue (the entire block from the analogy to the end) remains in French, leaving Spanish listeners without access to that information. This omission means critical content is missing, drastically reducing completeness.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation displays a solid grasp of most technical terms and retains the original conversational style, but the failure to translate a large segment of the dialogue into Spanish and a few small linguistic errors render the final product largely unusable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The mixture of French and Spanish, combined with missing content, significantly lowers overall quality. Substantial revisions are required to achieve a fluent, complete, and contextually adapted Spanish version."
