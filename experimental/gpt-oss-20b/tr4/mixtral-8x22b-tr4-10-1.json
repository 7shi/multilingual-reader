  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow, with most sentences logically arranged and the dialogue style preserved. However, occasional literal translations (e.g. “antisèche” and “en la sugerencia”) create small moments of confusion, lowering the overall clarity slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall, the translation reads smoothly for a native speaker, but some phrasing is unnatural or slightly awkward (“se le ha proporcionado una antisèche”, “en la sugerencia”). These issues affect the flow, though the bulk of the text remains natural.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and ICL are correctly rendered. The French loanword “antisèche” is not a Spanish term, and the word “memoria” is used correctly but inconsistently with the original “Memory”. Consistency could be improved, but terminology is mostly appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the original intent but misnaming the show (“Tecnología Express” vs “Tech Relámpago”) and misusing “sugerencia” instead of “prompt” detract from cultural and contextual fidelity. The core message is preserved, yet some localization details are off.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Key information is largely present, but the English sentence “Precisely. The model itself does not learn …” is left untranslated, creating a gap. Additionally, a few phrases are omitted or altered (“antisèche” is not translated into a Spanish equivalent). Therefore the content is incomplete.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation shows a solid grasp of the source material and conveys most ideas accurately. However, it suffers from a few literal translations, a missing English segment, and inconsistencies in naming and terminology that slightly reduce its effectiveness. A careful revision would raise its quality to near‑perfect level."
