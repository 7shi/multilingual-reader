  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version follows the original structure closely and most readers will be able to grasp the main ideas. Some sentences are a bit long or contain minor grammatical errors that can hinder quick comprehension, such as \"aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en contexto)\" or the missing accent in \"aprendizaje en contexto\". However, overall the text remains understandable.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is readable but shows several instances of unnatural phrasing and awkward grammar: \"se le ha proporcionado solo una antisèche\" (a word that should be spelled in Spanish as \"anticoche\" or better \"pseudocódigo\"), repetition of \"aprendizaje en contexto\" after the acronym, and occasional mismatches of gender or preposition. These quirks make the flow feel slightly choppy compared to native Spanish copy.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, and *anclaje* are correctly translated and consistent. The acronym ICL is introduced but not fully expanded, which could confuse some readers. The use of *fine‑tuning* in English is acceptable, but a Spanish equivalent like *ajuste fino* could improve consistency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and tone of the original podcast are preserved. The Spanish version uses culturally appropriate expressions and maintains the conversational style. Minor adaptations, such as changing \"consultant\" to \"consultor\", were handled well, though the translation could have taken more liberty to adapt idioms for better local resonance.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French transcript are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the final message about temporary vs permanent knowledge. Some redundant wording was retained from the source, but no critical information is missing.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is fundamentally correct and keeps the structure and technical content of the original. It is comprehensible and mostly faithful, but the fluency suffers from a few awkward phrasings and minor grammatical errors that should be cleaned up. Improving these details would elevate the text to a more natural and polished level for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
