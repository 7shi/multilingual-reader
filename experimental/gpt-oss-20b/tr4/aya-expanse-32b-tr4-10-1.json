  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to follow, with a clear logical progression that mirrors the French source. Sentence structures are generally simple, and complex concepts (e.g., pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) are introduced with adequate explanations. Minor issues—such as the awkward phrasing “Lo has entendido todo” or occasional long sentences—do not impede comprehension. Overall, readers can understand the content without undue effort.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads mostly naturally for native Spanish speakers. The translator preserves the conversational tone of the original dialogue and employs appropriate register. Some expressions feel slightly mechanical or redundant: “Aprendizaje en Contexto” is repeated in the same line, and “Lo has entendido todo” feels informal. Capitalisation inconsistencies (e.g., ‘Aprendizaje en Contexto’ vs. ‘aprendizaje en contexto’) and the use of “partes” for “parts” are minor irritants. Nonetheless, there are no major grammatical errors, and the vocabulary is contemporary.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled accurately and consistently: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding, ICL. The translator includes parenthetical translations for key terms, aiding comprehension. While the repetition of the term “Aprendizaje en Contexto” could be streamlined, no term is mistranslated or omitted. Overall, terminology is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references suitably: “Tech Relámpago” replaces “Tech Éclair” to fit Spanish‑speaking listeners. Idiomatic expressions are largely preserved, and the dialogue keeps its light, explanatory tone. Minor localization issues appear (e.g., “Lo has entendido todo” could be more natural as “Lo has entendido todo” without the emphasis). The adaptation succeeds in conveying the original intent while respecting Spanish linguistic norms.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French source appear in the Spanish version: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, the idea of a memory feature, and the concluding question about temporary versus permanent expertise. No significant content is omitted, and the translation does not add extraneous material. Redundancies are minimal, and the dialogue remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, successfully conveying the original podcast’s content and tone. The most noticeable weaknesses are minor fluency issues—particularly in capitalization and a few awkward phrasings—that could be smoothed out with a final proofreading pass. Terminology is handled with care, and the Spanish audience can grasp both the technical concepts and the narrative flow. Overall, this is a competent, faithful translation suitable for native Spanish listeners."
