  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and easy to follow. The speaker roles are preserved, and the sequence of ideas mirrors the original. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., *una conocimiento*) and the use of French‑style quotation marks slightly reduce clarity, but overall the text remains understandable to a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places. However, there are a few unnatural constructions: *Aprendizaje In‑Contexto* with capital letters, the abbreviation *AIC* instead of the more common *ICL*, and the phrase *un proyecto en curso* written as *un proyecto en curso* (duplicated but not wrong). These quirks slightly interrupt the flow, but overall the text is smooth and idiomatic.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly in most cases (*preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *anclaje*). The only issue is the inconsistent use of *Aprendizaje In‑Contexto*/AIC; the standard Spanish term would be *aprendizaje en contexto* or *ICL*. The term *grounding* is accurately rendered as *anclaje*.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The cultural context is respected; the translation avoids culturally specific idioms that could confuse Spanish listeners. The structure of the dialogue is preserved, and the tone remains informal and conversational. The use of French quotation marks and the capitalization of *Aprendizaje In‑Contexto* are slight stylistic mismatches, but they do not significantly alter the intent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All substantive content from the original French is present in the Spanish version. No key ideas are omitted, and the explanation of concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory features) is complete. The only small omission is the gender error (*una conocimiento*), which does not affect meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, accurately conveying the technical concepts and maintaining the conversational style of the original. Minor grammatical and stylistic issues reduce the score slightly, but the overall readability and naturalness are strong. This version would serve well for a Spanish‑speaking audience, with only a few edits needed for perfect polish."
