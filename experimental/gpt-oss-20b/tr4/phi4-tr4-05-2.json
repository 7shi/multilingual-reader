    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and the sentence structure is logical. However, occasional literal translations such as \"una memoria a corto plazo\" (instead of the more common \"memoria a corto plazo\"), and the use of parentheses around the original French terminology in places, slightly disrupt the flow. Overall, readers can follow the content without major confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly in many sections, but there are several awkward or non‑native expressions: the acronym for in‑context learning is incorrectly rendered as \"AICL\" instead of \"ICL\"; the phrase \"El refinamiento\" is acceptable but less common than \"ajuste fino\"; and some sentences are overly literal, such as \"El aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto).\" These quirks reduce the naturalness of the text.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly translated: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\" (written as \"afinamiento\"), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\", and \"memoria\". The inconsistency in the acronym for in‑context learning (\"AICL\" vs. \"ICL\") is a notable slip. Additionally, the term \"refinamiento\" could be replaced with \"ajuste fino\" for better consistency with common practice.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The cultural tone of a podcast introduction is preserved, and the narrative voice remains conversational. The translation keeps the same rhetorical devices (e.g., analogies about graduation, consultants, and bicycle riding) that help the target audience relate to the content. Minor cultural adjustments are unnecessary, so the adaptation is largely effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant information from the original French text is omitted. The Spanish version covers pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, context window, in‑context learning, anchoring, memory, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. The only slight redundancy is the repeated mention of \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and the occasional parenthetical references to the French terms, but these do not affect overall completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid overall, with clear conveyance of complex concepts and good readability. Minor issues—particularly the mis‑acronym for in‑context learning and some slightly awkward phrasing—prevent it from being perfect. With small adjustments to terminology consistency and a more natural flow in a few spots, the Spanish version would match the quality of the original French text more closely. It is an excellent draft that would only need minor polishing to reach top‑tier quality for a native Spanish audience.\n\nOverall Score: 17.2/20 (average of the five evaluation categories)."
