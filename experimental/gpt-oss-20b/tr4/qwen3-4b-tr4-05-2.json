    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but several sentences contain awkward phrasing or missing punctuation that can confuse a reader. For instance, the sentence *“El aprendizaje en contexto es el apretar”* is literally incorrect (apretar = squeeze). These issues lower overall readability, though the basic meaning is still accessible.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation uses a mix of literal and clumsy wording, resulting in a somewhat disjointed flow. Words like *apretar*, *apretar*, *en sus anteriores intercambios* and the frequent use of English terms interrupt natural Spanish rhythm. The translation does not fully match the natural tone of native Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto* and *grounding* are mostly correct and consistently applied. However, *prompt* is left untranslated, and some word choices (e.g., *apretar* for *bachotage*) are inaccurate. Overall, terminology handling is adequate but not perfect.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely keeps the original context and intent, but it often retains the literal structure of the French sentences and some culturally specific expressions are not fully adapted (e.g., the use of *apretar*). A more idiomatic Spanish adaptation would improve cultural resonance.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all information from the source is present, though some nuances are either lost (e.g., *bachotage* mis‑rendered as *apretar*) or slightly altered. No major content is omitted, but minor inconsistencies and missing clarifications reduce the completeness slightly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main ideas but suffers from several linguistic and terminological inaccuracies. Readability and fluency are hindered by literal phrasing and mistranslated words. While technical terms are mostly correct, the inconsistent handling of English terms and some culturally inappropriate expressions weaken the overall quality. With a more careful re‑examination of the language, particularly the problematic parts, the translation could reach a higher standard of clarity and naturalness for Spanish-speaking audiences."
