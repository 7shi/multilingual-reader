    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and follows a logical sentence structure. The concepts are explained in a way that most readers can understand. Minor issues arise from occasional abrupt punctuation and some informal wording (“Lo tienes todo claro”), but overall the content is easy to read.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural and smooth for native Spanish speakers. Phrases such as \"Lo tienes todo claro\" and the consistent use of gendered pronouns contribute to a conversational tone. However, occasional colloquialism and minor syntactic quirks (e.g., missing articles in some sentences) slightly reduce the fluency. No severe grammatical errors are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled accurately: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\". The term \"grounding\" is rendered as \"anclaje\", which is a valid Spanish equivalent. Consistency is maintained throughout. Minor variation in the English abbreviation \"ICL\" could be clarified, but overall terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational style, adapting cultural references appropriately (e.g., informal expressions). The Spanish version maintains the friendly, explanatory tone of the podcast. Slightly informal phrasing might not match all audiences, yet it does not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present in the Spanish text. No substantive information is omitted, and the dialogue flow is maintained. Redundancy is minimal, and the content remains concise. A minor duplication of \"Camille: Entiendo.\" exists but does not affect overall completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
