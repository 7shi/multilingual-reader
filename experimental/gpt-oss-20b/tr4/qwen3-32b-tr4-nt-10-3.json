  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and logically organized. Sentence structures mirror the original conversational flow, making it easy for Spanish‑speaking listeners to follow. Some idiomatic expressions were adapted appropriately, and complex concepts like pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained with simple analogies. Minor redundancies exist but do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural and smooth for native Spanish speakers. Word choices are mostly contemporary and the overall tone is conversational. A few phrases (“Se podría decir que sí”) feel slightly formal or clunky, and the acronym “AIC” diverges from the original “ICL”, but these do not impede readability.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled largely correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are appropriate. The use of “AIC (Aprendizaje In‑Contexto)” instead of the original “ICL” is a small inconsistency, but overall terminology remains accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the original intent and adapted cultural references suitably for a Spanish audience. The explanatory analogies are kept, and colloquial language is maintained. Only minor differences (e.g., the acronym change) affect authenticity, but the overall context remains faithful.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory vs. forgetting, and the consultant vs. expert metaphor. No essential information is omitted, and the text remains concise without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a high level of quality, preserving meaning, tone, and technical accuracy while being clear and natural for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Minor issues, such as the acronym discrepancy and some slightly awkward phrasing, are outweighed by the overall fidelity and fluency of the text. A score of 18 out of 20 reflects these strengths with room for small refinements in terminology consistency and stylistic polish."
