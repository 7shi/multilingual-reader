    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish script is largely clear and easy to follow. Most sentences mirror the structure of the original French and convey the intended meaning. Some minor issues—such as the abrupt “se le ha dado una chuleta” and a few missing conjunctions—slightly interrupt the flow, but overall the content remains comprehensible to a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly in most places, but a few expressions feel slightly informal or non‑idiomatic for a podcast script (e.g., “se le ha dado una chuleta” and “Lo has entendido todo”). The verb tense and word choice are generally appropriate, but occasional literal transfers (like “una antisèche” → “una chuleta”) make the text feel less polished.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are translated accurately and consistently: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje, memoria. The speaker’s references to these concepts are maintained without loss of meaning, and the terminology fits a lay audience’s understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original tone and conversational style. Cultural references are adapted appropriately for a Spanish‑speaking audience, and the script maintains its informal, explanatory character. Minor adjustments could improve cultural resonance, but overall the intent is preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French source are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory, and the comparison between temporary and permanent knowledge. No substantive information was omitted, and the script remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation delivers a faithful and largely fluent rendering of the original French podcast script. Technical terms are well handled, and the narrative flow is clear. A few expressions feel slightly informal or literal, which slightly detracts from the naturalness expected in a polished podcast script. Overall, the translation is of high quality and effectively conveys the original content to Spanish‑speaking listeners. A few stylistic refinements would bring it to a near‑perfect standard."
