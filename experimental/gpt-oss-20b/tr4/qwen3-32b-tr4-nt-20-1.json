  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely clear and follows a logical sequence that mirrors the original French dialogue. Sentences are mostly short and the conversation style helps readers follow along. Some passages, however, become a bit verbose (e.g., the explanation of the memory feature) and occasionally drop into a more explanatory tone that slightly interrupts the flow. Overall, the content is understandable to a general Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences read naturally, and idiomatic expressions such as \"el fin de la conversación\" or \"una ventana de discusión\" feel appropriate. Minor awkwardness appears in phrases like \"el aprendizaje en contexto, o AIC (In‑Context Learning)\" where the acronym AIC is not standard Spanish usage and might confuse listeners. Some prepositions and article usage are slightly off (e.g., \"de una ventana de discusión\" instead of \"de una nueva ventana de chat\"). Nevertheless, the overall rhythm is acceptable for native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are translated correctly and consistently. The translation adds explanations for less common concepts, which helps comprehension. The only potential issue is the use of \"AIC\" instead of the more common abbreviation \"ICL\" or simply \"aprendizaje en contexto\". Aside from that, terminology is appropriate and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the conversational tone and the purpose of the original podcast. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is straightforward. The translation could benefit from a few localized touches (e.g., using \"ventana de chat\" instead of \"ventana de discusión\"), but it generally maintains the intent and emotional register. The adaptation is good, but not exceptional.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All main ideas from the original French script are present. The Spanish version does not omit any critical information and keeps the dialogue structure intact. Some additional context is provided where the original might be implicit, which is helpful. No unnecessary repetition is added, keeping the content concise. Thus, the translation is complete and faithful.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation faithfully reproduces the content, terminology, and overall intent of the French original. Readability is strong, and the majority of the dialogue reads smoothly. A few minor fluency issues and a slightly unconventional acronym usage reduce the score marginally. Overall, it is a competent translation that would serve listeners well, though a final polish could improve naturalness and consistency in terminology usage, especially around acronyms and prepositions.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 16.8 out of 20, rounded to 17/20. If a single composite score is requested, it would be 17/20.\n\nReasoning: Each criterion was scored on a 0–20 scale based on clarity, naturalness, term accuracy, cultural fit, and completeness. The average of these scores provides a balanced overall assessment.\n\nscore: 17"
