  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is mostly clear and easy to follow. Long sentences are broken up adequately, and the conversational tone is preserved. Minor literal phrasings slightly reduce smoothness but overall readability is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a Spanish speaker, using appropriate idioms and syntax. Small awkwardness appears in a few instances (e.g., “Tech Luz” instead of “Tech Éclair”), yet the flow remains smooth.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, transferencia, and aprendizaje en contexto are correctly rendered. The term grounding is rendered as anclaje, which is understandable but not the most common translation; consistency is otherwise good.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The core intent is conveyed, but cultural adaptation is weakened by the incorrect renaming of the podcast to \"Tech Luz\" and a few literal translations that miss the original nuance. Minor adjustments would improve adaptation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present. No critical information is omitted, though some explanatory paraphrasing is minimal. The content is concise yet comprehensive.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the essential meaning and maintains technical clarity, but contains some errors in contextual adaptation and terminology nuance. Overall, it is a high‑quality rendition that could benefit from minor revisions to improve precision and cultural consistency."
