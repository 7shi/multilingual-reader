  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentence structures are mostly logical and the narrative flows smoothly. However, a few constructions feel slightly awkward, such as “se tiene la impresión” instead of the more natural “se da la impresión.” Nevertheless, readers can understand the content without major difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally overall, but there are a few unnatural expressions and punctuation errors. For example, the exclamation mark inside a quoted question is incorrect, and the phrase “entre bastidores” is an uncommon way to say “en segundo plano.” These issues slightly detract from the smoothness of the text.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled accurately and consistently: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"in‑context learning\" (ICL), \"grounding\" translated as \"anclaje\". The translation retains the meaning of the original terms and uses contemporary vocabulary.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and tone of the original are preserved. Cultural adaptation is adequate; expressions are suitable for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Minor adjustments, such as “se da la impresión” instead of “se tiene la impresión,” would improve naturalness but the current version still works well for the target audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is present, but a small error remains: the French phrase \"c'est du bachotage\" is left untranslated as \"c'est du bachotage\" instead of a Spanish equivalent. This omission slightly reduces completeness. No major sections are missing, but this slip should be corrected.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of good quality, conveying the main ideas clearly and accurately. Some minor phrasing and punctuation issues affect naturalness, and there is a small untranslated fragment that should be addressed. With those adjustments, the text would be nearly perfect for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
