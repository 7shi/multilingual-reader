  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are generally short and well‑structured, and the explanation of concepts such as pre‑training and fine‑tuning is coherent. Minor wording issues do not impede comprehension. 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly overall, but a few expressions feel slightly informal or awkward for a general audience, e.g., \"le hemos dado una chuleta\" and \"la IA no se perfecciona constantemente mediante tus conversaciones.\" These could be refined to more natural phrasing. 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly translated and consistently used throughout: \"preentrenamiento,\" \"afinamiento (fine‑tuning),\" \"aprendizaje por transferencia,\" \"ventana de contexto,\" \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL).\" Minor variations (e.g., \"afinamiento\" vs. \"ajuste fino\") are acceptable given the informal style. 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the conversational tone of the podcast and adapts idiomatic expressions reasonably well. Some phrases could be culturally optimized (e.g., replacing \"le hemos dado una chuleta\" with a slightly more formal equivalent), but overall the intent is preserved. 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French transcript are present in the Spanish version. No significant omissions or additions; redundancy is minimal and the content stays concise. 19/20.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the content and intent of the original French podcast. Minor fluency tweaks would elevate the text to a more polished level, but the current version is clear, accurate, and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Overall, it demonstrates good understanding of technical concepts and effective adaptation to the target language."
