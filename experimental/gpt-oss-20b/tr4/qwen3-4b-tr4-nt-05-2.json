    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable for native speakers. Most sentences follow the original structure, and the dialogue is clear. However, there are a few typographical and grammatical errors (e.g., “Las conocencias”, “las mismas informaciones”, “cuando usted afinan”) that interrupt the flow. The presence of these mistakes reduces overall readability, but the content is still comprehensible. The score reflects this moderate level of clarity and logical flow.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural expressions and insertions of foreign words (“bachoter”, “Simply”), as well as grammatical errors that make the text feel forced. While the vocabulary is generally appropriate, the phrasing is not entirely smooth or natural to a native Spanish speaker. These issues lower the fluency score. The score reflects a solid but imperfect level of naturalness.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly (e.g., pre-entrenamiento, fine-tuning as afinado, in‑context learning as aprendizaje en contexto). However, inconsistencies appear (e.g., “afinado” vs. “ajuste fino”), and some terms are misused or untranslated (“bachoter”, “conocencias”). The terminology is mostly appropriate but could be more consistent and precise. The score reflects this acceptable but imperfect handling.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the original intent and the conversational style, adapting cultural references appropriately. Minor awkwardness (e.g., “está surgiendo” instead of “está emergiendo”) and the insertion of English words slightly weaken the adaptation. Overall, the adaptation is effective but could be refined for smoother local resonance. The score reflects this near‑perfect adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present in the Spanish translation. There is no significant omission of information, and the dialogue structure remains intact. Minor issues arise from mis‑rendered words that may obscure meaning, but the overall content remains complete. The score reflects high completeness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful to the French original and conveys the main ideas and tone of the podcast. However, it suffers from several typographical and grammatical mistakes, inconsistent terminology usage, and a few unnatural phrasings that affect readability and fluency. With careful proofreading and refinement of terminology and style, the translation could reach a higher standard of quality and naturalness. Overall, it is a solid effort that would benefit from a final review and editing phase to polish the text and eliminate the highlighted errors. The translation shows good potential but needs corrections to achieve professional quality for a native Spanish audience. The overall score reflects a competent but improvable translation effort. The final score: 14/20."
