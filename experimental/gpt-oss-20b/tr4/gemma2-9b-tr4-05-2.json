  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation uses simple sentence structures and explains complex concepts in a straightforward manner. The dialogue flow is preserved and the audience can easily follow the conversation. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., \"esas conocimientos\" instead of \"esos conocimientos\") slightly hinder readability, but the overall comprehension remains high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall, the translation reads smoothly, but several terms feel awkward or non‑standard. \"Afianzamiento\" is an uncommon translation for fine‑tuning; \"ancrage\" should be rendered as \"anclaje\". The phrase \"el modelo en sí mismo no aprende\" is correct, yet the use of singular/plural verbs in a few spots (e.g., \"abrís\" vs. \"abre\") breaks the natural flow for native readers. The majority of sentences, however, sound natural and contemporary.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly correct: \"pre-entrenamiento\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are accurate. However, \"afianzamiento\" and \"fundamentación\" are inappropriate choices for \"fine‑tuning\" and \"grounding\", respectively. The translation also occasionally uses literal or ambiguous equivalents. Consistency across the text is uneven, which may confuse readers familiar with standard NLP terminology.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and maintains the conversational tone. Cultural adaptation is minimal, as the script is quite universal. The choice of the show name \"Tecnología Rápida\" preserves the playful nature, though it deviates slightly from a literal translation. Overall, context and cultural nuance are well preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original script are present. The dialogue structure, key concepts, and examples (English → French, memory features) are retained. Some minor wording changes do not alter meaning, and no significant information is omitted. The translation remains concise yet comprehensive.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material and delivers an understandable, mostly natural Spanish version. Nevertheless, it suffers from terminology inaccuracies that could mislead readers with a technical background. Correcting these terms and smoothing some awkward phrasing would bring the quality closer to a professional standard. Overall, it is a competent translation that would serve well in a general audience podcast context, but it should be refined for technical accuracy and fluency before publication to native Spanish listeners with an NLP focus. The final score reflects these strengths and weaknesses, averaging 15/20 overall. This indicates a good but improvable level of quality suitable for a first draft that requires polishing."
