  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable. Sentences are long but clear, and the use of analogies (graduate, consultant, bicycle) makes complex concepts approachable. Minor punctuation inconsistencies (missing commas before “o” in several places) slightly disrupt the flow, but overall readers can follow the dialogue without confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly smooth, with correct verb conjugations and natural phrasing. However, some phrases feel slightly literal, e.g. \"aprendizaje en contexto, o AIC (Aprendizaje In‑Context)\" where the acronym is wrongly adapted and the parentheses awkward. The alternation between \"afinamiento\" and \"refinamiento\" also introduces a subtle dissonance for native speakers. Overall, the text reads well but could be polished for perfect naturalness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *grounding* (anclaje) and *aprendizaje en contexto* are correctly translated and consistently used. The only inconsistency is the acronym for ICL: it is changed to AIC, which is not standard in Spanish. Aside from that, terminology is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The podcast title is changed from \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Tecno Flash\" and later to \"Tech Iluminado\". This inconsistency could confuse listeners and does not reflect the original branding. The use of the acronym AIC is another contextual error. Otherwise, the cultural adaptation is fine; Spanish-speaking listeners will understand the analogies and explanations. The score reflects the need for a more consistent adaptation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is preserved. The dialogue, the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL, grounding, memory, and the concluding remark are all present. No critical content is omitted, and no unnecessary additions appear. The only minor omission is the incorrect acronym, which does not change meaning but could mislead a technical reader.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation faithfully reproduces the meaning of the original French text and retains the conversational tone. It is largely readable and technically accurate, though a few details—especially the inconsistent podcast name and the mis‑translated acronym—need adjustment. With minor revisions, this translation would be considered high quality for a native Spanish-speaking audience. The final score is 79 out of 100, reflecting strong performance with room for polish in terminology consistency and contextual adaptation."
