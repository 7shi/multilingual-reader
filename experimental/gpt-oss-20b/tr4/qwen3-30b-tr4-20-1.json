  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is fragmented and missing many parts of the dialogue, making it hard for readers to follow the narrative. The existing sentences are simple, but the gaps force readers to guess what was omitted, reducing overall comprehensibility. 8/20.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation uses some correct terminology, but several sentences are awkward or incomplete (e.g., “El afinado... es allí donde interviene” or lone speaker tags with no text). Word choices such as “afinado” and “apoyarse” are acceptable, yet the lack of complete clauses and punctuation errors hinder smooth reading. 7/20.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms are largely preserved (e.g., aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, grounding → anclaje). However, inconsistencies arise with “afinado” vs. “ajuste fino” and missing explanations for some concepts. The terminology is mostly appropriate but lacks some consistency. 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation occasionally adapts cultural references (e.g., “consultor brillante”), but many parts are left untranslated or incomplete, weakening the intended conversational tone. The overall context is not fully conveyed. 8/20.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Significant portions of the original dialogue are omitted or left blank, including speaker exchanges and explanations. This leads to major information gaps that prevent readers from grasping the full discussion. 5/20.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation displays a basic grasp of the source material but suffers from numerous omissions, incomplete sentences, and occasional awkward phrasing. While key technical terms are largely correct, the overall readability and completeness are compromised, leaving readers with an unclear and fragmented narrative. The work would benefit from a thorough completion of missing sections and a review of flow and consistency before it can be considered a high‑quality translation. The final score reflects these shortcomings and highlights the need for substantial revision to meet a professional standard for Spanish translations of this type of content. 8/20."
