  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation preserves the clear, step‑by‑step explanation of the concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL, grounding). Sentences are generally short and logical, with only a few minor structural quirks (e.g., *Lo has entendido todo*). Overall the target readers can easily follow the content. 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly for native Spanish speakers. Minor grammatical slip‑ups such as *La IA no se afinan* instead of *la IA no se afina* and the slightly awkward *Lo has entendido todo* are the only issues. Vocabulary is contemporary and appropriate. 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje. No jargon is omitted and explanations are clear. 19/20.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The title *Tech Relámpago* is a natural Spanish equivalent for *Tech Éclair*. Cultural references and idioms are appropriate; the conversational tone matches the original podcast style. 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original is retained; no key points are missing. The translation includes every explanatory sentence and keeps the dialogue structure intact. 20/20.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate, fluent, and well adapted for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Minor grammatical adjustments would bring it to perfection, but it already conveys the original intent clearly and coherently. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation that respects both content and style."
