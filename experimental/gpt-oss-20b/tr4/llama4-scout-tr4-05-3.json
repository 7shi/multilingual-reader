  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to read. Sentences are short and the dialogue structure mirrors the original, making it straightforward for native speakers to follow. Minor issues appear in a few places (e.g., the phrase “un joven graduado universitario” feels slightly awkward, and the frequent use of quotation marks inside other quotation marks can momentarily disrupt flow). Nonetheless, comprehension is high and complex concepts are adequately explained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text flows smoothly and sounds natural to most Spanish speakers. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary. Occasional phrasing (“El ajuste…¿es ahí…?”) feels a touch informal but not incorrect. The translation maintains the conversational tone of the podcast. Minor grammatical slips (inconsistent capitalization of “Aprendizaje en contexto” and the repeated parenthetical explanation) do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled with great care. ‘Pre‑entrenamiento’, ‘ajuste fino’ (although simplified later to ‘ajuste’), ‘aprendizaje por transferencia’, ‘ventana de contexto’ and ‘grounding (anclaje)’ are correctly rendered. The acronym ICL is preserved and explained. The only minor concern is the occasional drop of the word ‘fino’ which could cause slight ambiguity, but overall terminology is consistent and accurate.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original to a Spanish‑speaking audience effectively. Cultural references are minimal, so no major adjustments were needed. The greeting “Hola y bienvenidos” replaces “Bonjour et bienvenue” nicely. Expressions such as “consultor brillante” or “consultor temporal” are idiomatic. Overall, intent and purpose are well conveyed with only trivial improvements possible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French original is present. The dialogue structure, the explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, and memory features are faithfully reproduced. No important details were omitted, and redundant passages are not added. The translation remains concise while keeping the content clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation of the French podcast script is of high quality. It is accurate, well‑structured, and readable. Minor refinements in terminology consistency and sentence phrasing could bring it to perfection, but as it stands it effectively conveys the original content to a Spanish‑speaking audience."
