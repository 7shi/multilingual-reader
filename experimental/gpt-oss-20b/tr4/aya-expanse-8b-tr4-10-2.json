  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation uses clear, conversational sentence structures that make the technical concepts approachable for a general audience. Most passages are easy to follow, with natural progression from pre‑training to fine‑tuning and in‑context learning. The only minor issues are a few slightly awkward clauses (e.g., *“El aprendizaje en contexto es como hacer un repaso apresurado”*), but overall the text remains highly readable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation flows smoothly in many places and feels native, but there are a few instances of unnatural phrasing and inconsistency. For example, *“La memoria”* is capitalised oddly, *“Tech Relámpago”* replaces the original show name without clear justification, and some punctuation is missing (the final exclamation is not closed). These small flaws reduce the overall naturalness of the text.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *ventana de contexto*, *anclaje*. The terminology is consistent and appropriate for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Only minor issues (e.g., the capitalisation of *Memoria* and the omission of a brief explanation for *IA*) slightly diminish the precision, but the terminology is largely accurate.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal, conversational tone of the original podcast and adapts expressions for Spanish listeners. However, the change from “Tech Éclair” to “Tech Relámpago” is inconsistent, and the missing closing punctuation at the end undermines the professionalism. These inconsistencies slightly weaken the contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all content from the French source is present. The dialogue structure, key points about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and memory features are all included. Small omissions exist (e.g., a more explicit mention of the need to differentiate between temporary knowledge and permanent skill), but the overall message is retained and the text remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and largely faithful to the source material. It conveys technical details clearly and keeps the conversational style, but some small inconsistencies in terminology usage, show name adaptation, and punctuation reduce its polish. With minor revisions, it could reach a near‑perfect level of quality."
