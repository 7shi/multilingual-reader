    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue follows a clear, logical structure and most readers can follow the flow. Minor issues such as the phrase “para dársela un bagaje general” feel awkward but do not impede comprehension. The sentences are mostly concise and easy to understand. 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions sound unnatural to a native speaker. Examples include “afinado fino” (instead of *ajuste fino*), “bagaje general”, the incorrect acronym “AICL”, and the gender‑number mismatch in “Las nuevas conocimientos”. These slip‑ups interrupt the natural flow and give the text a slightly choppy feel. 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are translated correctly – *preentrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *ventana de contexto*, *anclaje*, *memoria*. However, the acronyms *ICL* and *AIL* are mis‑rendered as *AICL* and *AIL*, which is a noticeable error. Also, “ajuste fino” would be more accurate than *afinado fino*. Overall, terminology is largely correct but has key mistakes. 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the conversational tone and the speaker dynamics. Cultural adaptation is adequate; idiomatic expressions are generally appropriate, though a few phrases (e.g., “bagaje general”) feel slightly literal. The intent and purpose of the original text are conveyed effectively. 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original dialogue are present; no substantive content is omitted. The translation also includes the necessary explanations for concepts such as transfer learning and in‑context learning. Minor redundancies exist but do not affect clarity. 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the overall meaning of the original French script and maintains the dialogue’s flow. Nevertheless, there are notable issues with terminology (incorrect acronyms and gender‑number mismatch) and some awkward wording that detract from a fully natural reading experience. With corrections to the terminology and a few phrasing adjustments, the translation would reach a high standard of quality."
