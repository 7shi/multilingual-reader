  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally clear and follows the original structure. Sentences are logically arranged and the main concepts are conveyed in a way that most native Spanish speakers would understand. Some sentences are long and could be broken up for easier reading, but overall the text remains comprehensible.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation flows well overall, but there are a few unnatural phrasings and occasional mixing of English terms (“prompt,” “fine‑tuning,” “ICL”) without proper Spanish equivalents. Some expressions, like “Es una trampa,” feel slightly abrupt. Nonetheless, the style remains conversational and appropriate for a podcast script.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “preentrenamiento” and “memoria a corto plazo” are correctly used. However, the use of the English terms “fine‑tuning,” “ICL,” “prompt,” and “grounding” (in parentheses) is inconsistent and may confuse readers unfamiliar with the English. A more uniform Spanish equivalent (e.g., “ajuste fino,” “aprendizaje en contexto,” “instrucción”) would improve consistency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent, preserves the podcast tone, and addresses a Spanish-speaking audience. Cultural references are minimal, and the adaptation is mostly faithful. Minor opportunities exist to localize certain expressions, but overall the content is well adapted.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present. No major omissions or additions that alter the meaning. The translation keeps the concise flow while maintaining the detailed explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL, and memory features.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and largely faithful to the original. It communicates the technical concepts and podcast narrative effectively, though the use of untranslated English terms and some slightly awkward phrasing slightly detract from native fluency. With a few adjustments—particularly standardizing terminology and smoothing out a few phrases—the translation could reach a higher level of polish."
