  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and the overall structure mirrors the original.  Some sentences, however, feel a little awkward (e.g., “Tienen todo claro” instead of “tienes todo claro”) and the article usage (“las informaciones”) is slightly off, which can momentarily disrupt the flow for a native reader.  Nonetheless, complex ideas such as pre‑training and in‑context learning are explained with sufficient clarity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly smoothly, but there are several places where word choice or syntax is not idiomatic.  For example, “Tienen todo claro” is incorrect for the singular “tú”, and “informaciones” should be “información”.  Phrases like “en el prompt, en segundo plano” sound literal.  These issues lower the naturalness of the text, though they do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled appropriately: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\" (afinado), \"in‑context learning\" (aprendizaje en contexto), \"anchoring\" (anclaje), \"context window\" (ventana de contexto).  The translation stays consistent and avoids mistranslations.  Minor adjustments (e.g., keeping the abbreviation ICL) would improve precision, but overall terminology is sound.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The informal, conversational tone of the original is preserved, and cultural references are translated in a way that Spanish listeners can easily relate to.  However, occasional misgendering (“Tienen todo claro”) and literal renderings of some expressions reduce the adaptation quality slightly.  The overall intent and purpose are conveyed effectively.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present in the Spanish translation, with no major omissions.  The additional explanatory comments (e.g., about memory in chatbots) are retained, and unnecessary repetition is avoided.  The content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely faithful and understandable, with most technical concepts correctly rendered.  Minor linguistic inaccuracies and some non‑idiomatic phrasing slightly detract from the overall fluency, but they do not hinder comprehension.  With a few adjustments for naturalness and consistency, the text would reach an excellent quality level for native Spanish audiences.  Overall, the translation demonstrates solid skill and a clear grasp of both source and target languages, earning a strong overall score of 16/20.  Improvements in pronoun agreement and more natural phrasing would elevate the work to an almost flawless level.  The translation is suitable for a general audience, though it could be polished further for publication or professional use.  Score: 16/20"
