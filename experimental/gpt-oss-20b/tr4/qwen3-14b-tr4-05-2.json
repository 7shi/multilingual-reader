  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally understandable for Spanish readers. Sentences are largely coherent, and the overall flow mimics the original. However, there are a few syntactic slips that hamper ease of reading, such as the subject‑verb disagreement in \"Lo han entendido todo\" and the misplaced comma in \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es estudiar de último momento.\" These errors slightly reduce readability.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly fluent, but several expressions feel forced or grammatically incorrect. For example, \"Lo han entendido todo\" should be \"Lo has entendido todo,\" and the comma in \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es estudiar de último momento\" breaks the natural rhythm. Additionally, some phrases such as \"El modelo mismo\" feel clunky. These issues make the text feel less natural to a native speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled largely correctly. \"preentrenamiento,\" \"aprendizaje por transferencia,\" and \"ventana de contexto\" are appropriate. The choice to keep the English term \"fine‑tuning\" within quotes is acceptable, though a Spanish equivalent could enhance consistency. Overall terminology is clear, consistent, and understandable for the target audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural adaptation is adequate; the references to everyday analogies (e.g., consulting) are familiar to Spanish speakers. Minor grammatical inaccuracies slightly dilute the cultural polish, but the adaptation remains effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original is present; no major omissions are noted. The translation includes every key point, and no extraneous content is added. The only concern is the slight wording error in the phrase about the prompt knowledge disappearing, which does not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation largely succeeds in conveying the original message, maintaining the informal, explanatory tone suitable for a podcast audience. It is readable and contains correct technical terminology, but a few grammatical slips and unnatural phrasing detract from overall fluency. With minor edits to subject‑verb agreement and punctuation, the translation would be polished to a near‑perfect level of naturalness and clarity for Spanish‑speaking listeners. The translation is well‑structured and largely faithful, making it a strong candidate for publication with slight revisions for fluency and correctness. The total score reflects a competent translation with room for refinement in grammatical precision and stylistic flow."
