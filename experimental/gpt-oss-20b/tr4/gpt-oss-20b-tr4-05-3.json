  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order that mirrors the original French dialogue. Some minor readability issues arise from the inconsistent use of formal and informal pronouns (“usted” vs. “tú”) and from the odd phrase “en la sombra”, which is a mistranslation of “en coulisses” and may momentarily confuse readers. Despite these hiccups, the content is clear and coherent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for native Spanish speakers. Vocabulary is mostly appropriate and the sentence structures are natural. The single awkward phrase “en la sombra” is the only noticeable slip; otherwise the text feels native and conversational.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered (e.g., preentrenamiento, afinamiento, anclaje, memoria a corto plazo, ICL). The only slight discrepancy is the choice of “afinamiento” versus the more common “ajuste fino”; however, it is still understood. Overall, terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator keeps the original intent and tone, and the cultural adaptation is generally good. The shift between formal and informal address (usted/tú) could be unified for a smoother reading experience. The mistranslation “en la sombra” slightly dilutes the contextual meaning. Otherwise, the adaptation is faithful and well‑adjusted.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No substantive content is omitted. All key points, examples, and analogies are present. The only loss is the meaning of “en coulisses” being partially lost in the phrase “en la sombra”. The rest of the information remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and mostly faithful to the original French text. It maintains the dialogue’s clarity, technical accuracy, and overall tone. Minor issues—particularly the mistranslated phrase “en la sombra” and inconsistent pronoun usage—should be corrected for a polished final version. With those fixes, the translation would be excellent."
