  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to read for a native audience. Sentences follow a logical order and most technical concepts are explained with adequate detail. However, some phrases such as \"enviar una nueva IA a la escuela\" or “el conocimiento que le proporcionas en el prompt” feel a little literal and could be streamlined for better flow. Minor issues with sentence length and occasional repetition slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads well overall, but there are a few unnatural constructions and inconsistent punctuation. For example, the translation of ICL as \"ACP\" and the use of capitalized abbreviations (“Aprendizaje en Contexto”) without proper explanation can sound awkward. Additionally, some verbs are slightly off (“aparecer” instead of “presentarle”) and the Spanish capitalization rules for titles and subtitles are not fully respected. These minor fluency issues lower the score marginally.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly translated: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, anclaje. The abbreviation for In‑Context Learning (ICL) was misrepresented as ACP; the correct abbreviation is ICL and should be introduced with its full Spanish expansion. Despite this, the terminology remains consistent within each concept, and the translation offers clear paraphrases where necessary.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation to Spanish is culturally appropriate: greetings, punctuation, and the overall conversational tone match the expectations of a Spanish‑speaking audience. The translation preserves the original intent, especially in explaining complex ideas. Minor adjustments, such as using more idiomatic expressions for “conversations” and “consultant” (consultor brillante), could enhance cultural resonance.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the original French text is present. No major omissions or additions occur, and the translation keeps the same level of detail. The only slight redundancy is in the repeated explanation of temporary vs permanent knowledge, but this mirrors the source text. The information is concise and clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and conveys the original meaning accurately. It maintains the explanatory depth and conversational style suitable for a general Spanish‑speaking audience. Improvements could focus on fine‑tuning terminology consistency (especially abbreviations) and smoothing out a few awkward phrasings. Overall, the translation achieves a high level of quality with minor room for polishing."
