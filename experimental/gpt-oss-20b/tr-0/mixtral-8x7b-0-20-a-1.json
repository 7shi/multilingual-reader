  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and logical, using straightforward sentence structures that allow a native reader to follow the discussion without confusion. Some short fragments such as “Todo claro” feel a bit abrupt, but overall the flow is smooth and the concepts are presented in a comprehensible manner.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most expressions sound natural; the dialogue retains a conversational tone. Minor stiffness appears in phrases like “se hace posible por la expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo”, which could be phrased more idiomatically. Nonetheless, grammar is correct and the vocabulary is contemporary.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly translated correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento” (fine‑tuning), “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto” (ICL), and “anchorage” as “ancraje”. The terminology is consistent across the transcript, and explanations are provided where needed.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and tone. Cultural adaptation is appropriate; idiomatic Spanish is used in the dialogue. Some literal translations are retained, but they do not hinder comprehension. Overall, the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant content is omitted. The translation captures every key point from the original, including the nuances about memory, fine‑tuning versus in‑context learning, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. Redundancies are minimal.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully preserving the meaning, tone, and technical details of the original French dialogue. Minor stylistic adjustments could improve naturalness, but the text is clear, fluent, and well‑adapted for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Overall, it is an excellent translation."
