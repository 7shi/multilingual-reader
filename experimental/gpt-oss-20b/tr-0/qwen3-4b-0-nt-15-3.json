    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and the overall structure of the dialogue is preserved. However, a few sentences contain awkward word choices or missing prepositions (e.g., “bienvenido en” instead of “bienvenido a”) that slightly hinder comprehension for native readers. The explanation of technical concepts is clear, but occasional literal translations make some passages feel clunky.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text mostly reads smoothly, but there are several grammatical slips (“la IA no se afinan”, “Se tiene la impresión”) and unnatural idioms (“una astucia”) that break the flow for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate overall, yet a few wordings could be polished to sound more natural (e.g., “la IA no se afina” instead of “la IA no se afinan”).",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning are correctly rendered. Consistency is good, though the phrase “aplicación de in‑context learning” is slightly redundant. Explanations for terms are present where needed. Minor inconsistencies in capitalization (IA) do not significantly affect understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the conversational tone of the original French script and adapts cultural references appropriately. Nevertheless, some expressions (e.g., “una astucia” or “se tiene la impresión”) are less idiomatic in Spanish and could be refined to better fit the target audience’s expectations.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all content from the original transcript is retained. No major information is omitted; supplementary explanations are added only where the target audience might need them. The translation does not add unnecessary repetitions, keeping the dialogue concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the intent and technical content of the original French podcast fairly well, with clear dialogue and correct terminology. A few grammatical inaccuracies and slightly awkward phrasing detract from the overall polish. With minor corrections, the text would read smoothly and naturally for native Spanish speakers while maintaining full informational integrity."
