  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version uses clear sentence structure and explains complex concepts (e.g., pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL) in a way that is understandable for a general audience. Minor syntactic quirks do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural to a native Spanish speaker, but a few awkward constructions (e.g., \"La IA no se ajusta constantemente por tus conversaciones\" instead of \"a partir de\" or \"con tus conversaciones\") and inconsistent hyphenation (pre‑entrenamiento vs preentrenamiento) slightly reduce smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste\" (fine‑tuning), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\". The terms are consistent throughout and appropriately adapted for a Spanish-speaking audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue tone is preserved, cultural references are neutral and suitable for Spanish listeners, and the introduction \"Hola y bienvenidos a 'Tech Éclair'\" fits the target audience. Minor phrasing could be more idiomatic, but overall intent is effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French text appears in the Spanish translation; no key points are omitted and redundancy is minimized. The content remains concise while maintaining clarity.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, accurately conveying the original meaning while maintaining readability for Spanish-speaking listeners. Minor fluency adjustments would further improve naturalness, but the work is largely complete and faithful to the source material."
