    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version keeps the overall flow and is largely understandable, but there are several punctuation issues (excessive exclamation marks, missing commas) and a few sentence fragments that make the text feel a bit choppy. Simple explanations of complex concepts are present, but the occasional literal translation (“obtener cultura general” instead of “adquirir una cultura general”) slightly hinders clarity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation uses appropriate vocabulary and generally follows Spanish grammatical conventions. However, the repetitive use of exclamation points at the beginning of many lines is unnatural for formal or podcast scripts. Minor syntactic oddities such as “¡Imaginemos que enviamos una IA totalmente nueva a la escuela para que obtenga cultura general” and the inconsistent capitalization of technical terms affect the smoothness of the text.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms (preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, ventana de contexto) are accurately translated and consistently used. The Spanish equivalents are idiomatic and reflect current terminology in the field. The only slight inconsistency is the use of both “ajuste” and “fine‑tuning” for the same concept, but this is acceptable given the bilingual nature of the audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone, adapting cultural references appropriately (e.g., “consultor brillante” instead of a literal “consultant”). The script’s informal, conversational style is preserved, and the Spanish audience’s expectations are met. Some minor adjustments (e.g., changing “obtener cultura general” to “adquirir una cultura general”) would improve naturalness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French source are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the consultant‑vs‑expert analogy. No critical information is omitted, and the addition of a brief explanation for “grounding” is helpful. Redundancy is minimal, but the repetition of exclamation marks introduces unnecessary noise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid overall and conveys the technical content clearly to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Readability and fluency would benefit from a cleaner punctuation style and a few minor rephrasings, but the terminology is handled accurately and the script’s intent remains intact. With minor polishing, the translation would be ready for publication or broadcast."
