  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and logically structured, allowing native readers to follow the conversation and the technical explanations. Sentences are mostly concise and the use of parenthetical explanations (e.g., explaining transfer learning) aids comprehension. A few minor punctuation tweaks could improve flow, but overall readability is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural to Spanish speakers, with appropriate idiomatic expressions and correct grammar. Occasional awkward phrasings such as \"Lo has entendido todo\" and \"se ha vaciado su espacio de trabajo temporal\" slightly disrupt the smoothness but do not hinder understanding. Overall fluency is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\". The terminology matches standard Spanish AI vocabulary and remains uniform throughout the text. No mislabeling or confusing synonyms are present.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational tone and cultural references are preserved; the show name \"Tech Éclair\" is retained, and the dialogue format feels native. No culturally inappropriate content appears, and the adaptation to Spanish-speaking audiences is appropriate. Minor localization could involve adjusting greetings, but overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All original information is included; no key concepts or explanations are omitted. The translation maintains the same level of detail and structure, avoiding redundancy while keeping the content concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material, preserving technical accuracy and conversational flow. Minor fluency issues and a few stylistic refinements could elevate it to perfection, but it is overall clear, accurate, and well‑adapted to a Spanish‑speaking audience. The translator managed to balance literal fidelity with natural expression, making the text accessible and engaging."
