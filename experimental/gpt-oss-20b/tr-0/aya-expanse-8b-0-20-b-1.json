  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the dialogue retains its conversational tone. Some phrases are slightly long and could be broken up for smoother reading, but overall readers can understand the content without confusion.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in many places, but there are a few awkward constructions (“La IA no se ajusta constantemente a través de sus conversaciones.”) and inconsistencies in terminology usage (“fine‑tuning” in parentheses). The final line mistakenly uses “Tech Luz” instead of the original brand name, which feels out of place. These issues slightly reduce the overall fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, context window, in‑context learning, and grounding are correctly translated and consistently applied. Explanations accompany the terms, making them accessible to a general audience. Minor inconsistencies (e.g., mixing English and Spanish terms) are acceptable but do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, adapting greetings and cultural references appropriately. The shift from French to Spanish is handled smoothly, but the final name change to “Tech Luz” detracts from brand consistency. Otherwise, the dialogue feels naturally localized.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original script are present, and no essential information is omitted. The dialogue maintains its logical flow, and redundancies are minimal. The only notable omission is a slight variation in the final brand name, which is a minor error rather than a content loss.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is generally competent and captures the core message and tone of the original French dialogue. It effectively conveys the technical concepts to a Spanish‑speaking audience while keeping the conversational style. Minor lapses in fluency and an inconsistent brand name reduce the overall polish, but the text remains clear, technically accurate, and largely faithful to the source material. The translation would benefit from a final proofread to correct the small naturalness issues and ensure brand consistency throughout the episode. Overall, it is a solid, publishable rendition that serves its purpose well."
