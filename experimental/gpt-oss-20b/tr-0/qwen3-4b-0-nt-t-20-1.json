    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely understandable, but several sentences have awkward structure or incorrect grammar that can distract readers (e.g., “La IA no se afinan” instead of “la IA no se afina”). Punctuation is mostly correct, though some sentences end with a question mark where a period would be more natural. Overall, readers can follow the content but may need to pause on a few spots.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text does not flow as smoothly as a native‑written piece. Conjugation mistakes (\"se afinan\"), literal word choices (“antiespia”), and odd phrasing (“la IA no ha olvidado… su espacio de trabajo temporal simplemente ha sido vaciado”) create a stilted tone. Vocabulary is mostly correct, but the rhythm suffers.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered (preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL). However, some terms are not idiomatic: \"afinamiento\" should be \"ajuste fino\", \"antiespia\" is unusual, and there is inconsistent gender agreement (e.g., \"una IA…\" vs. \"la IA…\"). Explanations are adequate but could be clearer.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the podcast style and intent, but cultural adaptation is limited. Expressions such as \"una antiespia\" do not resonate with Spanish speakers, and the literal transfer of French idioms (e.g., “la IA no ha olvidado” instead of a more natural “no se ha olvidado”) weakens the adaptation. Overall, it conveys the meaning but lacks polish.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French source are present, and no critical information is omitted. The dialogue remains faithful, and redundancies are minimal. However, some explanatory phrases could be condensed for brevity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is functional and conveys the core ideas, but it suffers from several grammatical errors, awkward word choices, and occasional mistranslations of technical terms. For a professional Spanish‑speaking audience, the text would benefit from a thorough copy‑editing pass focusing on conjugation, idiomatic terminology, and smoother sentence flow. Once those adjustments are made, the translation would read naturally and professionally."
