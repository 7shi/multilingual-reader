    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely readable and the sentence structure follows a logical flow that matches the original.  Some sentences, however, feel slightly stiff (“Imaginen que enviamos una IA totalmente nueva a la escuela”) and there are a few minor syntactic oddities (“Cuando se abre una nueva ventana”).  Overall, listeners would grasp the content without confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but a few phrases read more like literal translations (“la afinación” for fine‑tuning, “el aprendizaje en contexto” repeated twice).  There are occasional unnatural word choices (“anclaje” for grounding) and punctuation errors (missing accents).  The text would read smoothly for native Spanish speakers with a few edits.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved: pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, etc.  The choice of “la afinación” for fine‑tuning is acceptable but could be clearer with “ajuste fino.”  Terminology is consistent throughout, and where concepts could be opaque, a brief explanation is provided.  Minor improvements could be made for consistency and contemporary usage.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent of the original podcast is well preserved; the translation keeps the conversational tone and cultural references appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience.  Some expressions could be more idiomatic (e.g., “conocimiento general” instead of “cultura general”).  The adaptation effectively conveys the key ideas while respecting the target culture.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All critical points from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, memory features, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge.  No major content is omitted, and redundancy is generally avoided.  Minor details such as exact phrasing of “grounding” or “memory” could be clarified, but the overall information is complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and understandable, faithfully conveying the technical concepts while maintaining a conversational tone.  Minor refinements in naturalness, terminology consistency, and a few punctuation corrections would elevate it to a polished professional level.  It is suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience with a moderate to advanced understanding of AI terminology.  Overall, a solid effort that meets most evaluation criteria with small room for improvement.  Score: 18/20.  The translation demonstrates a good grasp of both language and subject matter, though a few stylistic adjustments would enhance clarity and flow for native listeners.  The overall rating reflects this balanced assessment.  (Score: 18/20.)"
