  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely easy to read. Sentences are mostly in a natural order, and the flow follows the original script. However, there are a few awkward phrasing choices (e.g., \"la IA no 'olvida' en el sentido humano\") and some repeated words that slightly hinder comprehension. Overall, listeners would understand the content without significant difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is mostly fluent, but a few expressions feel stilted or literal (e.g., \"Da la impresión de que la IA recuerda los detalles de mi proyecto\", \"la IA no 'olvida' en el sentido humano\"). The use of quotation marks around \"olvida\" is unnecessary. Some sentences could be re‑structured for smoother flow, but native speakers would still parse them easily.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anchoring\" → \"anclaje\", etc. The translation maintains consistency throughout the text. Minor improvement could be adding a brief explanation of \"ICL\" at first mention, but overall terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The script’s tone and cultural references are generally preserved. However, the name of the podcast changes from \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Tech Luz\", which is inconsistent and potentially confusing. Some phrasing (e.g., \"la IA no 'olvida' en el sentido humano\") could be better adapted to colloquial Spanish. Still, the core intent and conversational style are kept intact.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, anchoring, memory vs. context, the new memory feature, and the final question. No significant content is omitted, and the translation keeps the same level of detail. Minor wording changes do not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and communicates the original message well. It accurately conveys technical concepts and maintains the conversational flow, but a few linguistic adjustments and consistency fixes (especially the podcast name) would raise the quality to a professional level. The translation is functional for Spanish‑speaking audiences and retains the instructional intent of the original French transcript, though it could benefit from a final polish to improve naturalness and consistency. Overall, a competent job with minor room for improvement in fluency and contextual adaptation."
