  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version retains the dialogue structure and overall meaning, making it largely comprehensible for native readers. However, some sentences have a slightly awkward order or missing articles, which can mildly hinder flow. The text is clear enough to follow the discussion, but not entirely smooth.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely natural, but there are a few clumsy or literal choices—e.g., “La IA no se fine‑tune” mixes English and Spanish, and “se le hizo una ‘antisèche’” introduces a foreign word. Such slips interrupt the rhythm, though the rest of the language is fluent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"afinamiento\" for fine‑tuning, \"Aprendizaje en contexto\" for ICL, \"anclaje\" for grounding, etc. The terminology is consistent and appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience, though minor terms like \"fine‑tune\" could have been translated uniformly as \"ajuste fino\".",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the overall intent and cultural references. The only notable mismatch is the title, translated as \"Tech Flash\" instead of keeping the original French name \"Tech Éclair,\" which slightly alters the branding. Otherwise, expressions are suitable for Spanish listeners.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the original is present; no key ideas are omitted. The dialogue is fully reproduced, and the explanation of concepts is intact. Minor omissions are negligible, and no unnecessary repetition occurs.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful and understandable, with a few awkward phrasings and a minor title mismatch. It conveys the technical concepts clearly and keeps the conversational tone. With minor polish—especially in natural phrasing and consistent terminology—the translation would be excellent."
