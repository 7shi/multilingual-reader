  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version follows a logical sentence structure and keeps the same dialogue format, making it easy for native readers to follow. Complex concepts such as pre‑training and fine‑tuning are explained in a straightforward way. However, some sentences are slightly long and could be broken up for smoother reading. Overall, the text is comprehensible but could benefit from minor tightening.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely smooth and uses appropriate vocabulary. Minor unnatural expressions appear, e.g., \"¿Es entonces un truco?\" instead of a more natural \"¿Es una trampa?\" or \"¿Es un truco?\", and the use of \"informaciones\" instead of the singular \"información\". Additionally, the term \"ventana de contexto\" could be phrased more naturally as \"ventana de contexto\". Overall the fluency is good but has room for improvement.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\" (translated as \"afinamiento\"), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"grounding\" (anclaje), and \"memoria a corto plazo\". These align with common Spanish AI terminology and are understandable for a general audience. Minor issues: \"memoria a corto plazo\" could be \"memoria de corto plazo\", but this does not hinder comprehension. Overall, terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the meaning of the original but makes a significant change: the podcast title is translated as \"Tecno Relámpago\" instead of keeping the original \"Tech Éclair\". This alters the brand identity and could confuse listeners. Aside from that, cultural references are adapted correctly and the text feels natural for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The adaptation is mostly accurate but the name change is a notable slip.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. The dialogue structure, explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, and memory mechanisms are all covered. No critical omissions are observed, and the translation is concise without unnecessary repetition. Minor redundancy appears in some repeated explanations, but overall the content remains complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely faithful and understandable, with appropriate technical terminology and clear explanations. The main drawback is the change of the podcast’s name, which could affect brand recognition. Minor linguistic refinements would improve fluency, but overall the translation serves its purpose well for Spanish‑speaking audiences watching the episode. The overall quality is good, warranting a solid score near the upper mid‑range of the scale.  Overall Score: 16/20."
