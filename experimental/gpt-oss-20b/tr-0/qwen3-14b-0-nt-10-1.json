  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version follows the original dialogue structure and most sentences are clear enough for a native reader to understand. However, a few sentences contain awkward word order or literal translations that slightly hinder smooth comprehension (e.g., “cuando comienzas” vs “cuando abres”). Overall, the text remains readable but could be refined for better flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation uses generally correct grammar and vocabulary, but several expressions feel literal or slightly off (e.g., “Entonces es una astucia ?”, “comenzás” instead of “comienzas”). These small issues reduce the naturalness of the text. The dialogue still sounds conversational but could benefit from polishing.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, ventana de contexto, grounding. The terminology is consistent throughout the script, and the level of detail matches the original. Only minor stylistic choices (e.g., “astuta” for “ingeniosa”) could be improved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references are handled appropriately, and the Spanish version maintains the casual, explanatory style of the podcast. Minor adjustments (e.g., using “consultor” instead of “consultant”) could improve localisation, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant content is omitted; the dialogue, explanations, and examples are all present. The translator kept the same length and level of detail, ensuring that readers receive the full context of the original.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the main ideas of the French source accurately and with a largely natural tone. While a few literal phrasings and minor grammatical mistakes detract from perfect fluency, the text remains clear, technically correct, and faithful to the original intent. A brief copy‑editing pass would bring the translation up to a near‑perfect level for a native audience."
