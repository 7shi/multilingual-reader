  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely comprehensible, with clear sentence structure and explanations that follow the French script logically. Minor issues arise with longer sentences that could benefit from shorter clauses, but overall the text is easy to follow for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally reads smoothly, but several phrases feel awkward or grammatically incorrect for native speakers. Examples include the plural “Lo habéis entendido todo” instead of the correct singular “Lo has entendido todo,” and the clunky “Se le ha proporcionado una libreta de apuntes.” These errors interrupt the natural flow, though the vocabulary is largely appropriate.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre-entrenamiento,\" \"ajuste fino,\" \"aprendizaje en contexto,\" and \"anclaje\" are all accurate translations. Consistency is maintained throughout, and terms are matched to the context without unnecessary paraphrasing.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator keeps the original intent and conversational tone, but some idiomatic expressions and cultural references could be adapted better. Phrases like \"se le ha proporcionado una libreta de apuntes\" sound literal rather than idiomatic. Despite this, the overall meaning remains clear.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogues and explanations from the French source are present in the Spanish version, with no significant omissions. The translation preserves the sequence and detail of the conversation, though a few lines are slightly rephrased for clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and conveys the technical concepts and conversational style of the original French script. While readability and terminology are strong, fluency suffers from occasional grammatical mistakes and unnatural phrasing that could be polished. With a few adjustments, the translation would achieve a near‑native quality and fully satisfy a Spanish‑speaking audience’s expectations for a podcast transcript about AI concepts. The overall score reflects a competent but improvable translation effort, meriting a 17/20 rating for its clarity and completeness, tempered by fluency issues that need refining. The translation is understandable and informative, making it suitable for listeners familiar with technical discussions in Spanish, provided minor corrections are made to enhance naturalness and precision."
