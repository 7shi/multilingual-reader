  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the logical flow of the dialogue and clearly explains complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning. Sentences are mostly straightforward, with short clauses that aid comprehension. Minor issues arise when long French‑style structures are translated verbatim (e.g., \"por lo tanto\" followed by a long explanatory clause), but overall the text is easily readable for a general Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places and uses contemporary vocabulary. However, there are a few awkward phrasings that carry a literal, almost word‑for‑word feel (e.g., \"por lo tanto\" repeated, \"la IA no ha olvidado\" where a more idiomatic \"la IA no ha olvidado\" would be smoother). Grammatical construction is mostly correct, but occasional verb tense mismatches slightly disrupt the flow. Overall, the translation is fluent with minor room for improvement.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled accurately: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"in‑context learning\" are all correctly rendered. Consistency is maintained across the transcript. Some terms could benefit from a brief explanation for lay readers (e.g., \"fine‑tuning\" translated as \"afinamiento\" without explicit clarification), but the overall terminology remains appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the intent and tone of the original French podcast. Cultural references and conversational style are suitably adapted for Spanish listeners. The use of colloquial expressions like \"se abre una nueva ventana\" aligns with Spanish listening habits. Minor adjustments could improve cultural resonance, but the overall adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present: the stages of AI learning, the analogy of a student, the contrast between fine‑tuning and ICL, and the explanation of the memory feature. No significant omissions are detected. The translation is concise yet thorough, and redundancy is avoided. Slightly more explicit transitions could enhance clarity, but the content remains complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, maintaining the clarity, technical accuracy, and conversational tone of the original French podcast. Minor issues such as occasional literal phrasing and slight grammatical tweaks could refine the text, but overall it meets the expectations for readability, fluency, terminology, contextual adaptation, and completeness."
