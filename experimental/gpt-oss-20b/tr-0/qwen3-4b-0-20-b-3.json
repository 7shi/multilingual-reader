  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish transcript is largely understandable, with most sentences following a logical flow that mirrors the original French dialogue. However, occasional grammatical slips (e.g., *la IA no se afinan*, *a la vuela*) and the inconsistent use of formal *usted* versus informal *tú* can momentarily confuse readers. Overall, readability is solid but not flawless.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the translation captures the conversational tone, several expressions feel unnatural: *una antisèche*, *a la vuela*, and the gender mismatch in *la IA no se afinan*. These quirks, along with minor punctuation inconsistencies, lower the fluidity of the text.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, and *anclaje* are correctly rendered and consistently used. The use of the French loanword *antisèche* is non‑standard in Spanish and slightly disrupts terminology coherence. Overall, terminology is handled well but not perfectly.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original intent and colloquial style, adapting cultural references appropriately. The shift from informal to formal register in some spots, however, weakens contextual adaptation. The translation remains faithful but could benefit from consistent register usage.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version; nothing critical is omitted. Minor wording choices do not alter the meaning, and redundant phrasing is largely avoided. The completeness is therefore high.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the essential ideas of the original French dialogue and includes all necessary information. Nonetheless, it suffers from several linguistic inaccuracies—grammatical errors, awkward expressions, and inconsistent register—that affect readability and fluency. With some polishing and standardization of terminology, the quality could be significantly improved."
