  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the dialogue structure and most key ideas, making it largely understandable to native readers. However, several missing accents (e.g., *porque*, *expansión*) and a few awkward phrasings (e.g., *“Parece”* vs *“parece”*) interrupt the flow. Some lines still retain French words or phrasing, which can confuse readers. Overall, it is readable but not polished.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains numerous grammatical and lexical errors that break the natural flow. For instance, *se acuerda* is an odd choice for *se recuerda*, *una conocimiento* is incorrect, and *Telle est la réalité* is a literal copy from French. These errors make the translation feel clunky and less natural to Spanish speakers. The vocabulary is generally appropriate, but the syntax and occasional word choice reduce fluency.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are handled correctly (e.g., *preentrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning* → *afinado*, *grounding* → *anclaje*). Nevertheless, inconsistencies arise: *in‑context learning* is sometimes left untranslated, and *memory to short‑term* is rendered as *memoria a uso único* (not a precise translation). The overall terminology is mostly accurate, but a few terms could be refined for clarity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally captures the informal, conversational tone of the podcast and adapts cultural references suitably. However, some expressions remain untranslated or are directly copied from French, which undermines the adaptation. The dialogue still feels slightly disjointed in places due to mixed-language remnants.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Key information is largely preserved, but there are gaps: the section where the French sentences were left unchanged (“Telle est la réalité…”) removes context, and the transition about *memory* is omitted. Minor details (e.g., the nuance of *“grounding”*) are present, yet the overall completeness is affected by these omissions and errors.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material but is marred by numerous grammatical, lexical, and consistency errors. The main ideas are conveyed, yet the text suffers from awkward phrasing, missing accents, and incomplete adaptation. With some proofreading and careful adjustment of terminology and syntax, the quality could be raised significantly. The current version sits around a mid‑level score, reflecting both strengths in general comprehension and weaknesses in fluency and precision. Overall, the translation is usable but requires revision to meet professional standards for a native Spanish audience. 14/20."
