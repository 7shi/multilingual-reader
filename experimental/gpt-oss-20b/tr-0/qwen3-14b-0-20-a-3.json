  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely comprehensible and the sentence structure is generally logical. However, there are several small issues that can hinder smooth reading: repeated use of \"por lo tanto\", some awkward phrasing such as \"es bacotaje\" (which is a colloquial English borrowing), missing accents (e.g., \"construcción\"), and occasional grammatical errors (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenida\" instead of the more natural \"Hola y bienvenidos\"). These factors reduce overall readability slightly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text feels mostly natural to a native Spanish speaker. Nonetheless, some expressions feel forced or non‑idiomatic: \"es bacotaje\", \"con la IA\" instead of the more common \"a la IA\", and the heavy use of \"por lo tanto\" can sound mechanical. Minor punctuation and accent mistakes also affect fluency. Overall, the translation sounds smooth but could be polished further.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently. \"Preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", and \"grounding\" are appropriately translated. The translation also preserves the meaning of the original terms and offers clear explanations when needed. The only minor concern is the choice of \"bacotaje\" for \"bashing\", which is not standard technical vocabulary. Otherwise, terminology is accurate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts many cultural nuances, e.g., changing \"Hola y bienvenida\" to a more inclusive greeting. However, it retains some French stylistic patterns and occasionally uses English loanwords like \"bacotaje\". The overall intent is preserved, but a few expressions could be localized more naturally to Spanish‑speaking audiences.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French text is present. The translation does not omit any key points and keeps the content concise. No redundant sections appear, and the structure of the dialogue is faithfully maintained. Therefore, the translation is complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, preserving the original meaning and flow. Some stylistic and lexical improvements could enhance readability and fluency, but overall it is clear, accurate, and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor adjustments—especially replacing non‑idiomatic expressions and correcting occasional grammatical slips—would bring it to an excellent level of polish and naturalness. Overall, the translation demonstrates good command of the target language and a solid understanding of the source content, resulting in a reliable and engaging final product. Overall score: 84/100."
