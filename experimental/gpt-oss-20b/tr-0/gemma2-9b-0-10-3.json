  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and easy to follow. The sentence structures mirror the original French, making the content comprehensible for a native Spanish speaker. However, some expressions feel slightly literal, e.g., *« afianzamiento »* for *« affi­nagement »*, which can be confusing for readers who are not familiar with this uncommon translation. The paragraph on memory and context is concise and well‑organized, aiding readability. Overall, the text is understandable but could benefit from more idiomatic phrasing in a few spots.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly overall, with appropriate idioms such as *« aprendizaje en contexto »* and *« ventana de contexto »*. Nevertheless, a few phrases feel a bit clunky, e.g., *« se le proporcionó una pista justo antes de que comenzara a hablar contigo »* and *« afianzamiento »*. The choice of words is generally contemporary and appropriate, but minor adjustments would make the text feel more natural to a native speaker. There is also a subtle repetition of *« información »* in some parts. Thus, the fluency is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: *« preentrenamiento », « aprendizaje por transferencia », « ventana de contexto »*, and *« ICL »* are well translated. However, *« affi­nancement »* is rendered as *« afianzamiento »*, which is not the standard term; *« fine‑tuning »* is usually translated as *« ajuste fino »* or *« afinación »*. Likewise, *« grounding »* is rendered as *« fundamentación »*, whereas *« anclaje »* would be more common. These inconsistencies could cause confusion for readers familiar with standard terminology. Overall, the terminology is understandable but lacks consistency in a few key terms.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation effectively preserves the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is straightforward. The speaker names are kept, and the dialogue format is preserved. Minor cultural nuances (e.g., phrasing of *« anclaje »* vs *« fundamento »*) are not significant enough to distort meaning. The adaptation is adequate, but some wording could be more idiomatic for a Spanish-speaking audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory concepts, and the final takeaway. No essential information is omitted. The translation sometimes adds slight clarifications (e.g., explaining the role of *« anclaje »*) which improve understanding without introducing redundancy. Thus the information coverage is complete and concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely faithful and conveys the original meaning accurately. It is readable and covers all necessary information. However, a few technical terms are translated in non‑standard ways, and some expressions feel slightly literal or clunky. With minor refinements to terminology (e.g., *« ajuste fino »* instead of *« afianzamiento »*, *« anclaje »* for *« grounding »*) and smoothing of a few phrases, the text would read even more naturally to Spanish speakers. Overall, it is a solid translation that could benefit from a final polish for optimal clarity and fluency, particularly for readers familiar with common AI terminology in Spanish.\n\nThe final score for each criterion reflects these observations.\n\n\"score\": 73/100"
