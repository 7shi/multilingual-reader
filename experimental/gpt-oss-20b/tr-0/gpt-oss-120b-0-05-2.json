  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation preserves the original dialogue structure and presents the concepts in a straightforward manner. Sentences are generally concise and easy to follow, though a few compound sentences may be slightly dense for casual readers. Overall, the text is highly comprehensible for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most expressions sound natural and the grammar is correct. Minor awkwardities exist—e.g., \"Se puede decir eso\" and the phrase \"IA no se afina constantemente con tus conversaciones\"—but they do not impede understanding. The vocabulary choice is contemporary and appropriate for a general audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"anclaje\" are correctly rendered and consistently used throughout the text. Explanations accompany unfamiliar terms, making the jargon accessible.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and tone, and cultural nuances are respected. Some stylistic choices could be further localized (e.g., smoother connectors), but the overall cultural adaptation is adequate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French transcript are present. No substantive content is omitted, and redundancies are avoided. Minor phrasing differences do not change meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the meaning and nuance of the original French text. While a few small linguistic refinements could enhance naturalness, the translation remains clear, technically accurate, and contextually appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
