  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version keeps the original structure and pacing, making the dialogue easy to follow. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning are explained clearly, and the sentences are logically ordered. Some minor wording choices (e.g., *« se le ha proporcionado un resumen justo antes de que comience a hablarle »*) feel a bit literal but do not impede understanding. Overall, readers can comfortably grasp the content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker and most expressions are natural. However, a few constructions are slightly awkward: *« se le ha proporcionado un resumen justo antes de que comience a hablarle »* and the repetition of *« por lo tanto »* can feel redundant. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, but the translation occasionally relies on direct literal phrasing rather than idiomatic equivalents. These issues keep the score from a perfect 20 but the overall fluency remains high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are translated consistently: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *grounding* → *anclaje*, *memoria*. The terms are standard in Spanish AI discourse and are explained where necessary, so readers unfamiliar with the jargon can follow. No significant terms were omitted or mistranslated, and the consistency across the script is maintained.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The script is adapted to Spanish-speaking listeners: idiomatic expressions like *« es como contratar a un consultor brillante »* and the conversational tone are suitable for a podcast audience. Cultural references are minimal, so no major adjustments were needed. The translation preserves the original intent and conversational flow, making it appropriate for the target demographic.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French text is present. The Spanish version does not omit any key point; it retains every dialogue exchange, including the explanation of memory mechanisms and the distinction between temporary and permanent learning. The content remains concise without unnecessary repetition, ensuring completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality: it is readable, largely fluent, technically accurate, culturally adapted, and fully complete. Minor phrasing tweaks could improve naturalness, but these do not detract from the overall clarity and effectiveness of the script for Spanish-speaking listeners."
