    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and logically organized. The sentences follow a natural progression, and the conversational tone matches the original. Some longer sentences are slightly cumbersome but still understandable. Minor issues arise with a few missing articles (e.g., *La IA no está refinando* instead of *La IA no se está refinando*), but overall the material is easy to follow for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly in most places. However, there are a few awkward phrasings and inconsistent capitalisation, such as *Aprendizaje In‑Contexto* and *Lo tienes completamente claro*. The sentence *La IA no está refinando constantemente a través de tus conversaciones* would sound more natural as *La IA no se está refinando constantemente a través de tus conversaciones*. These small grammatical slips slightly reduce the naturalness of the text.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *in‑context learning* (translated as *aprendizaje en contexto*). The use of *grounding* as *anclaje* is appropriate. Terminology is consistent throughout the dialogue, and no key concept is misnamed or omitted. Minor improvements could include using *contexto* instead of *in‑contexto* for consistency.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the intent and informal tone of the original French podcast. Cultural references are adapted appropriately for Spanish‑speaking listeners, e.g., the consultant analogy. The dialogue markers (Camille:, Luc:) remain intact, helping readers track speakers. The overall message is clearly conveyed, though the opening “Hola y bienvenido a ‘Tech Éclair’” could better mirror the French “Bonjour et bienvenue…”; the difference is negligible.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original is present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the key conclusion. No substantive content is omitted, and the translation avoids unnecessary repetition. The addition of small explanatory notes (e.g., clarifying the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge) is helpful and does not clutter the text.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the original dialogue’s content, tone, and technical details. Minor grammatical and stylistic refinements would raise the fluency slightly, but the text is readable, technically accurate, and culturally adapted for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Overall, it is a solid translation that meets professional standards for a podcast transcript."
