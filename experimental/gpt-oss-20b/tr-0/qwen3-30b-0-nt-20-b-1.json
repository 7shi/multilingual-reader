  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation follows the structure of the original French text closely and uses clear, mostly natural phrasing. Readers who are fluent in Spanish can understand the content without confusion. The only issues are a handful of small grammatical slips such as “las conocimientos” (should be “los conocimientos”) and “las leyes de la equilibrio” (should be “las leyes del equilibrio”), which slightly hinder readability but do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall, the prose sounds natural to a Spanish speaker. The translator occasionally repeats English terms like *fine-tuning* without a Spanish equivalent, but this is acceptable in a technical context. The sentence “Las conocimientos que proporcionas en el prompt” is awkward, as is “Ella lo olvida todo,” but these are minor and do not derail the flow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled appropriately: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *in‑context learning* (Aprendizaje en Contexto), *grounding* (anclaje). Consistency is maintained throughout the script. The only minor slip is “informaciones” instead of singular “información,” but it does not alter meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects Spanish cultural norms and idiomatic expressions. Phrases such as “cajas negras” and “consultor brillante” fit the target audience well. The adaptation preserves the original’s humor and conversational tone. No contextual misunderstandings are apparent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Every sentence, quote, and nuance from the original French transcript is present in the Spanish version. No factual details are omitted, and the flow of the dialogue remains intact. Minor grammatical errors do not constitute omissions.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is high‑quality and faithfully conveys the content, tone, and technical details of the French original. The few grammatical slips and occasional awkward phrasing are the only blemishes, but they do not significantly impair the overall effectiveness of the translation. It is suitable for a native Spanish audience and retains the script’s conversational dynamics and technical accuracy."
