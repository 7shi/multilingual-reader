  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely comprehensible, but several gender‑agreement mistakes (e.g., *la afinar*, *la anclaje*) and awkward word choices make some sentences feel clunky. The logical flow of the dialogue is preserved, but the readability is lowered by these errors.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains a number of unnatural expressions and inconsistent register (mix of *tú* and *usted*). Phrases such as *Usted lo ha entendido todo* and *la IA no se afina* read oddly to a native speaker. Overall, the translation sounds somewhat mechanical, earning a moderate fluency score.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Several technical terms are incorrectly rendered: *la afinar* instead of *el afinado*, *la anclaje* instead of *el anclaje*, and the expansion of ICL as *Aprendizaje en Contexto Interno* (should be *Aprendizaje en Contexto*). Consistency is also an issue, which reduces the score.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator attempts to localize the style but falls short by mixing formal and informal pronouns and occasionally choosing less natural expressions (e.g., *la ventana de contexto* is fine, but *una información básica* feels vague). Cultural adaptation is acceptable but could be smoother.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No major content is omitted; the transcript’s meaning is largely preserved. Minor stylistic adjustments could improve clarity, but the core information remains intact.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers the main ideas and dialogue structure, but suffers from several gender‑agreement mistakes, awkward phrasing, and terminological inaccuracies. While the overall meaning is preserved, a more careful editing of the language would significantly improve readability and naturalness. The translator should review gender agreement, register consistency, and correct technical terms to achieve a higher quality output. Overall, the translation is functional but requires refinement to meet professional standards for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The average score reflects these strengths and weaknesses, resulting in a moderate overall rating around 12/20. The final score out of 20 is 12.2, rounded to 12 for simplicity. This indicates room for improvement, especially in terminology handling and fluency."
