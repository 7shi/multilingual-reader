  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, but several sentences are clunky or missing articles, which can momentarily confuse the reader. The overall structure follows the original, yet some long sentences could be broken up for easier reading. Consequently, it earns a moderate score of 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions feel unnatural or grammatically incorrect – for instance, \"¡Entendiste todo!\" should be \"¡Has entendido todo!\", and the use of \"tienes\" instead of \"tiene\" in a few places. The translation also lacks appropriate punctuation in places (e.g., missing commas after introductory clauses). These issues lower the naturalness of the text, warranting a score of 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"afinación\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"Aprendizaje In-Context\" (ICL). The translation of \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\" is acceptable in the AI context, though it could have been clarified. Overall, terminology is accurate and consistent, earning 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the informal, conversational tone of the original podcast. Cultural references are largely preserved, but some expressions (e.g., “¡Entendiste todo!”) feel forced. Minor adjustments for Spanish idiomatic usage would improve it, hence a score of 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant content is omitted; all key ideas, examples, and explanations are present. Minor wording errors do not alter the meaning, so the text remains complete. This justifies a score of 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the core ideas and keeps the dialogue’s playful style, but grammatical inaccuracies and some unnatural phrasings detract from overall quality. With clearer sentence structures and more precise idiomatic choices, the text could reach a higher level of polish while preserving its technical accuracy."
