    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely comprehensible; the main ideas flow and most sentences can be followed by a Spanish reader. However, there are noticeable gaps (e.g., an unfinished dialogue line “Es decir?”) and awkward phrasing that interrupt the narrative rhythm. Punctuation errors and missing subjects reduce clarity in a few places.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The overall cadence of the translation feels uneven. Phrases such as “Entendido todo.”, “Todo se olvida.”, and the wrong word “crunchar” (should be “crunch” or a suitable Spanish equivalent) are unidiomatic. Additionally, repeated words (“Camille: Camille:”) and the insertion of French words like “antisèche” make the prose feel disjointed. A native speaker would find the dialogue slightly stilted.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered correctly – *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto* (ICL), *anclaje*. Consistency is good across the text. The one misstep is the misuse of “crunchar.” Overall, the terminology is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and humor, but some idiomatic expressions from French are lost or replaced with literal, less natural Spanish. Cultural references are kept but could be refined for a Spanish audience (e.g., explaining “grounding” in a more everyday way). Overall, adaptation is adequate but not polished.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all content from the source appears in the translation. Minor omissions exist (e.g., the brief “Es decir?” line has no reply), and a few redundant lines are present, but no critical information is missing. The translation remains largely faithful and exhaustive.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the main ideas and technical concepts but suffers from several grammatical, lexical, and stylistic issues that hinder readability and naturalness. A revision focusing on sentence flow, accurate word choice, and elimination of duplicate lines would greatly improve the final product. The content is largely correct and complete, so the overall quality is acceptable but not exemplary."
