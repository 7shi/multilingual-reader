  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely coherent and follows the same logical order as the French source. Sentences are reasonably short and the conversation flows naturally, making it easy for a Spanish‑speaking listener to follow the technical concepts. Minor issues such as the repetition of “preentrenamiento” instead of the more common “preentrenado” and a few slightly awkward phrasings slightly reduce the clarity, but overall the text remains readable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly for most native Spanish speakers. However, there are some non‑idiomatic word choices: “afinamiento” instead of the more usual “ajuste fino” or “afinado”, and the phrase “una hoja de trucos” feels a bit colloquial. The use of “ancrage” (left untranslated) also interrupts the flow. These minor glitches lower the naturalness score slightly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, and transfer learning are correctly rendered. Consistency issues arise with “afinamiento” vs “afinado”, and the untranslated “ancrage” breaks consistency. A better choice would be “anclaje”. Overall terminology is accurate but not entirely consistent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts idioms appropriately (“consultor brillante” for “bright consultant”, “vía de memoria” for “memory feature”) and respects the cultural background of a Spanish‑speaking audience. The explanatory tone matches the original. Small adjustments could improve localization (e.g., using “ajuste fino” instead of “afinamiento”).",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French transcript are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the consultant vs expert analogy. No substantive content is omitted. The only minor loss is the untranslated “ancrage,” which slightly reduces clarity but does not remove any essential information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and largely faithful to the original. It successfully conveys the technical concepts and conversational tone, making the material accessible to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor issues with word choice, consistency, and a single untranslated term prevent a perfect score, but the overall quality is high and suitable for a public podcast script. Improving consistency in terminology (e.g., using “ajuste fino”/“afinado” and fully translating “ancrage” to “anclaje”) would elevate the translation to near‑perfect fluency and technical accuracy."
