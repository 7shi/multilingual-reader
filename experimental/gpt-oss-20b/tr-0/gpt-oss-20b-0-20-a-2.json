    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand, with clear sentence structure and logical flow. Some long sentences could be broken up for better clarity, but overall the target audience can follow the content without difficulty.",

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinación\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"Aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly rendered and consistently used. Explanations accompany terms when necessary, maintaining clarity for the reader.",
