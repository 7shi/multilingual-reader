  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows a logical progression that mirrors the French original. Sentences are mostly well‑structured, but a few are slightly awkward (e.g., \"Ustedes han entendido todo\") and there are missing accents that can hinder readability for a native audience. Overall, the material can be comprehended without major effort.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads quite smoothly in many places, but several constructions feel unnatural to a native Spanish speaker. Phrases like \"Ustedes han entendido todo\" and the occasional abrupt switch between first and second person introduce a dissonance. Additionally, some verbs lack proper conjugation or accentuation (e.g., \"se olvidan\" vs. \"se olvidó\"). The vocabulary is mostly appropriate, yet a few word choices could be refined for better flow.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled accurately and consistently: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"memoria a corto plazo\" are all correctly rendered. The translator kept the terminology in line with common Spanish-language AI jargon, aiding comprehension for the target audience. Minor inconsistencies exist but do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone, which is appropriate for a podcast format. Cultural references remain neutral, and the adaptation does not introduce any misinterpretations. However, some expressions could be more idiomatic for Spanish‑speaking listeners (e.g., \"es como contratar un consultor brillante\" could be phrased more naturally). Overall, the adaptation is effective with room for fine‑tuning.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No essential details were omitted, and the content stays concise. The translation does not add unnecessary repetition, though some explanatory phrases could be tightened for brevity. The completeness of the content is strong.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the core ideas and maintains technical accuracy. While readability and fluency could be improved with more natural phrasing and consistent verb forms, the text remains intelligible and faithful to the original. Minor editorial adjustments would elevate the translation to near‑native quality. Overall, it is a solid, functional rendition suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but it would benefit from a final polish to address the identified linguistic quirks and improve overall flow."
