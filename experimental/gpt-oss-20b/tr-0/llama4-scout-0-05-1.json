  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely understandable, but many sentences are fragmented or contain literal, awkward phrasing. Sections such as \"Lee una cantidad masiva de datos en Internet\" and the repeated phrase “Telle est la réalité de l'ICL” (which appears untranslated) break the flow. Readers may have to reread to grasp meaning. The overall coherence is moderate, earning 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text frequently contains grammatical errors (e.g., \"Se lo olvidan todo\"), untranslated fragments, and unnatural constructions like \"Esta approach se llama aprendizaje en contexto\". Some parts are even left in English. These issues reduce naturalness, justifying a score of 10/20.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core terms such as *pre-entrenamiento*, *ajuste*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, and *transfer learning* are used correctly, though inconsistently in places. The phrase \"grounding\" is translated as *anclaje*, which is acceptable. However, inconsistencies and occasional omissions lower the score to 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to adapt cultural references (e.g., the consultant metaphor), but it also introduces extraneous or incomplete English remarks. The overall intent is preserved, yet the adaptation lacks polish, warranting 11/20.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several parts of the original dialogue are missing or truncated—particularly the latter segments where the narrator discusses memory features. This loss of content reduces completeness, resulting in a 9/20.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a basic grasp of the source material but suffers from numerous inaccuracies, incomplete passages, and stylistic problems. While the main ideas are conveyed, the reading experience is disrupted by grammatical mistakes and inconsistent terminology. The text would benefit from a thorough edit to improve fluency, fill gaps, and polish the language."
