  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely understandable and follows the logical progression of the dialogue. Sentences are short and the speaker alternation is clear. However, a few sentences feel awkward or overly literal, which can momentarily confuse a native reader. Overall, the text is comprehensible, but not completely smooth.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The overall tone is conversational, matching a podcast style, but there are several instances of awkward phrasing: e.g., \"la IA le hace un ajuste fino\" instead of \"se le aplica un ajuste fino\", or \"enviar a la escuela\" which sounds literal. Minor grammatical inconsistencies (missing accents in some words) also reduce naturalness. Vocabulary is mostly appropriate, but a few word choices feel stiff. Thus the fluency is good but not native‑like.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly translated correctly: pre-entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anchoring, grounding. Consistency is maintained throughout the script. Explanations accompanying terms are clear and the terminology aligns with common Spanish AI usage. No major errors in term selection or usage.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and humor of a friendly podcast. Cultural references are adapted appropriately; however, some expressions feel too literal, losing the natural flow expected in Spanish media. The dialogue feels slightly formal in places where a more relaxed tone could be used. Still, the overall meaning and context are preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French original is present. The dialogue covers pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory features, and the final reflection. No essential detail is omitted, and the translation does not add irrelevant information. Redundancy is minimal, and the content stays concise while clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and conveys the technical concepts accurately, but it falls short of native‑level fluency due to some literal phrasing and occasional awkward word choices. The terminology is handled well and the script’s intent is preserved, but a smoother, more natural Spanish style would improve readability. Overall, it is a solid translation that would serve a Spanish‑speaking audience, albeit with room for polish in style and flow. The final score is 82 out of 100, reflecting strong technical accuracy but moderate naturalness issues. The scoring per criterion is presented above in detail. The translation would benefit from a final review focusing on idiomatic expressions and smoother sentence construction, especially in conversational parts. Once those adjustments are made, it would reach a high‑quality, native‑readable standard. The above evaluation provides specific feedback to guide those refinements. Good job overall, keep iterating for fluency!"
