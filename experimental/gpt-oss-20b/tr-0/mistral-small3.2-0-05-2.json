  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to understand. The dialogue structure is preserved and the sentences flow logically. Some minor grammatical mismatches (e.g., “Lo han entendido todo” instead of “Lo has entendido todo”) slightly hinder clarity, but overall readers can grasp the concepts without confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly natural but contains a few awkward expressions and grammatical errors that break the flow for native Spanish speakers. Examples include “Lo han entendido todo”, “Lo que parece”, and literal “aprendizaje en contexto automatizado” instead of a smoother phrasing. These issues reduce the overall fluency score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *anclaje*, and the acronym *ICL* are correctly rendered and consistently used throughout the text. The translation maintains the intended meaning of each term and provides clear equivalents.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation captures the original intent and maintains a conversational tone suitable for Spanish listeners. Cultural references are minimal, so the translation doesn’t require heavy localization. Minor adjustments could improve idiomatic feel, but the overall message is effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present in the Spanish version. No significant omissions are detected, and the translation retains the detailed explanations of AI concepts. Redundancies are kept where necessary for clarity, but unnecessary repetition is avoided.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and largely faithful to the original French text. It preserves the technical accuracy and conversational style, though some grammatical slips and slightly unnatural phrasing slightly detract from its naturalness. With minor corrections, the Spanish version would be polished and fully accessible to native listeners."
