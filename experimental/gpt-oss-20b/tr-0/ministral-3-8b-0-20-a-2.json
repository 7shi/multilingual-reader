  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the overall flow of the original dialogue and is largely understandable. The sentence structure is mostly logical, though a few long sentences could be broken up for clarity. Complex ideas such as pre‑training and fine‑tuning are explained in plain language, which aids comprehension for general readers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally to a Spanish speaker. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary. Minor awkwardness appears in phrases like \"una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\", but these do not hinder understanding. The translation avoids literal, stilted expressions and uses idiomatic equivalents where possible.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"grounding\" translated as \"anclaje\". While some terms (e.g., \"fine‑tuning\") could be rendered as \"ajuste fino\", the chosen translations are widely understood. Explanations accompany specialized concepts, maintaining clarity for readers of varying technical background.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and tone, and adapts expressions that would feel odd in Spanish, such as using \"consultor brillante\" instead of a literal translation. Cultural references are neutral and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The conversational style of a podcast is preserved, making it engaging.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No critical details were omitted, and the content remains concise. Minor redundancies were avoided, and the dialogue flow mirrors the source text, ensuring completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the technical content while maintaining a natural, engaging tone. Minor refinements could improve fluency and readability, but overall the Spanish version serves its purpose well for a general audience."
