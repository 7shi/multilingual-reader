  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely comprehensible and follows a logical sentence structure. It retains the original meaning and the use of conversational phrasing (e.g., \"Imagínense que enviamos una IA…\") helps readers follow the narrative. Minor issues such as occasional missing commas or slight abruptness in the flow slightly reduce the overall clarity, but they do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly sounds natural for native Spanish speakers, with appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic expressions. However, there are several grammatical slips (e.g., \"la IA no se afinan\", subject‑verb agreement errors, incorrect plural forms such as \"intercambios\" instead of \"intercambios\"), and some awkward phrasing (“antes de que ella comenzara a hablar con ustedes”). These errors lower the overall smoothness, but the piece still reads reasonably well.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", \"memoria\". The translator consistently keeps the same terms throughout. The only odd choice is the use of the French word \"antisèche\"; a Spanish equivalent would be clearer. Overall, terminology is appropriate and understandable for the target audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and the casual, explanatory tone. Cultural references are adapted appropriately (e.g., comparison to a consultant, bike analogy). However, the gender agreement issues and the French interjection \"antisèche\" slightly weaken the contextual flow. The text still respects Spanish linguistic norms overall.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French script is present: the stages of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, context‑window expansion, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the consultant vs. permanent‑expert analogy. No substantive content is omitted, and redundancy is minimal. The translation remains concise yet clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the essence of the original French dialogue and communicates the technical concepts effectively. While grammatical and stylistic imperfections slightly affect fluency and readability, the core ideas are preserved, terminology is handled consistently, and the message is culturally adapted to Spanish-speaking listeners. Minor revisions (correcting subject‑verb agreement, removing foreign interjections, smoothing a few phrases) would elevate the quality to a near‑perfect level, but the current version is functional and largely faithful to the source text. The overall quality of the translation is solid and would be well understood by its intended audience, though it is not flawless in terms of native speaker fluency."
