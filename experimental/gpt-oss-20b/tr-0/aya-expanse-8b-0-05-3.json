  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally easy to follow and the main ideas of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning and memory are clearly presented. Minor issues arise with the phrase *apuntar para un examen* (which is understandable but slightly awkward) and with occasional missing accents or punctuation, but overall readers will grasp the content without confusion.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for native Spanish speakers, using appropriate register and most idiomatic expressions. Some parts feel a little mechanical (e.g., *apuntar*, *da la impresión*). There are also a few typographical errors such as the misplaced exclamation mark at the end and the incorrect abbreviation *LCI* instead of *ICL*, but these do not severely disrupt the flow.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *grounding* → *anclaje*, and *in‑context learning* → *aprendizaje en contexto*. Consistency is maintained throughout the transcript. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., *preentrenamiento* vs *pre‑entrenamiento*) are acceptable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the conversational tone of the original podcast, adapts cultural references appropriately, and keeps the humor of comparing AI to a graduate and a consultant. Slightly unnatural phrasing in a couple of lines detracts slightly, but overall the context is well adapted.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant content is omitted; all key points of the French source are represented. The only small omission is the accidental abbreviation *LCI* instead of *ICL*, which could cause confusion but does not remove substantive information. The transcript remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the gist and structure of the original French podcast fairly well. It is largely readable and fluent, with accurate technical terminology and good contextual adaptation. Minor errors—particularly in punctuation, phrasing, and an incorrect abbreviation—slightly reduce the overall polish but do not impede comprehension. A few editorial refinements would bring it to a higher level of quality, especially in the more natural rendering of phrases such as \"apuntar para un examen\" and in correcting the *ICL* abbreviation and final punctuation.\n\nScore: 16.5 out of 20."
