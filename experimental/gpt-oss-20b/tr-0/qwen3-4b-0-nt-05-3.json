    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable; most sentences follow a logical order and the key concepts are conveyed clearly. However, several phrases are slightly awkward or literal (e.g., “se ataque a la mecánica cuántica”, “El modelo en sí mismo no aprende…”), which can momentarily hinder smooth reading. Overall, the text is accessible to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains a few grammatical errors and unnatural expressions such as “se ataque a la mecánica cuántica” and “No necesita rep aprender lo que es un verbo”. Additionally, the preposition “en” in the opening line should be “a”. These issues lower the naturalness of the text. Nevertheless, the majority of sentences flow reasonably well and the vocabulary is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled mostly correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje\". The translation consistently uses the same terms throughout, and the definitions are clear enough for the intended listeners. Minor improvements could be made (e.g., using \"ajuste fino\" instead of \"afinamiento\" for \"fine‑tuning\"), but overall terminology is sound.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the conversational tone suitable for a podcast. Cultural references are minimal and the adaptation is adequate. However, some expressions could be more idiomatic (“Miren: no enseñaríais las matemáticas básicas…”). The overall intent and purpose are preserved, making the content appropriate for Spanish listeners.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant information is omitted; the dialogue and explanations from the original French script are fully present. The Spanish version includes all the key points about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and memory features. Some minor typos do not affect understanding, so the completeness criterion is well met.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the essence of the original French script and communicates the technical concepts clearly. It is largely understandable and covers all the necessary information. Nonetheless, several grammatical mistakes and slightly awkward phrasing detract from its fluency and naturalness. With minor edits, the translation would be near‑perfect for a Spanish‑speaking audience listening to a tech podcast."
