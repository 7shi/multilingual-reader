  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and easy to follow. The sentence structure is logical and the main ideas are conveyed without excessive complexity. Minor issues arise with occasional misplaced English words (“Simply”), a typographical error (“antiespuma”) and a slightly awkward phrasing (“la IA no se afinan”), but these do not significantly hinder comprehension for a native speaker.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally fluent and natural. Most expressions sound idiomatic and contemporary. The awkward mix of English words (e.g., “Simply”) and the small spelling/grammar errors introduce a few unnatural moments, yet the overall flow remains smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine-tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\" are correctly translated. However, the word \"antisèche\" was left untranslated (appearing as the incorrect “antisèche”/“antiespuma”), and the phrase \"la IA no se afinan\" is slightly grammatically off. Consistency is otherwise good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation successfully adapts cultural references and idioms. Expressions such as “anclaje” for grounding, and the use of everyday analogies are appropriate for Spanish-speaking audiences. Minor improvements could involve translating “antisèche” to a more natural Spanish equivalent like \"hoja de trucos\".",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French script is present. No significant content is omitted, and the translation retains the dialogue’s structure and intent. The inclusion of all technical explanations and contextual notes demonstrates full completeness.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is highly accurate and understandable, with a few minor typographical and linguistic slips that slightly affect fluency and terminology precision. The overall quality is excellent, preserving the original’s intent, tone, and detail while being accessible to a Spanish-speaking audience. Addressing the small errors noted would bring the translation to a flawless level."
