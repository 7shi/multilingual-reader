  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to read for native speakers and keeps the conversational tone of the original. Sentences are logically structured and the overall narrative flow is preserved. A few minor issues such as the use of \"Entendieron todo\" instead of a more natural phrase and a slight inconsistency in pronoun usage (\"abres\" vs. \"empezáis\") slightly reduce the clarity, but the impact is minimal.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural. Word choices are appropriate and contemporary. However, there are a few unnatural or slightly awkward expressions: \"Entendieron todo\" feels formal rather than conversational, and the mix of singular and plural forms in the sentence about opening a new window disrupts the rhythm. These do not seriously impede comprehension, but they lower the fluency score modestly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\". Acronym ICL is preserved, and the concept of \"grounding\" is translated as \"anclaje\", which is a good choice. The translation stays true to the intended meaning without confusing jargon.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content for Spanish-speaking audiences: colloquial expressions are used, the show name is left unchanged for recognizability, and cultural references are minimal. The use of \"vosotros\" may not be universal, but it does not hinder understanding. Overall, intent and purpose are effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French transcript is present. No omissions or added misinformation are found. The translation maintains conciseness and avoids unnecessary repetition while preserving nuance.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality. It accurately conveys the technical concepts and maintains the original dialogue's tone. Minor fluency issues and a slight pronoun inconsistency are the only drawbacks, leaving a strong, coherent, and reader-friendly version of the original script. This makes it suitable for a native Spanish-speaking audience interested in AI and technology podcasts. Overall score: 18/20 (average of the five criteria)."
