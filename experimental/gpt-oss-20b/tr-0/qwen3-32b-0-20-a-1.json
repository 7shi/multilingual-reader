  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow, with clear sentence structures and most technical concepts well explained. Minor issues include missing accent marks (e.g., \"¿Porque\" should be \"¿Por qué\") and inconsistent capitalization of \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\". These small errors slightly reduce overall clarity, but the text remains comprehensible.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly smoothly, yet several expressions feel slightly awkward or literal, such as \"Aprendizaje en contexto es memorización para examen\" and occasional capitalization errors. While understandable, the phrasing could be more natural for native speakers. Overall fluency is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"grounding\", \"memoria a corto plazo\". The terms are consistently used and align with Spanish-speaking AI community usage, making the terminology highly appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation preserves the original intent and conversational tone, and it takes into account Spanish-speaking audience conventions. Cultural references are kept faithful, and the dialogue flow feels natural. Minor adjustments could improve cultural resonance, but the overall contextual adaptation is strong.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue segments and key information from the original are present. No significant content is omitted, and redundant passages are kept minimal. The translation effectively conveys the same meaning as the source.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid overall, with strong terminology handling and good contextual adaptation. Readability is clear but marred by a few typographic and capitalization errors. Fluency suffers from occasional unnatural phrasing. The content remains complete and faithful to the original, resulting in a competent but not flawless translation that would be suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience with minor editing for polish and consistency needed before publication. The overall quality is acceptable for educational or informational purposes, though professional polish would improve the listening experience for native speakers. The total score reflects a solid translation with room for refinement in naturalness and consistency, earning a score of 16 out of 20 in overall quality. This rating indicates the translation is good but could benefit from further review to address the noted issues and ensure a smoother, more professional finish for the target audience.

This balanced assessment reflects the strengths and weaknesses identified across all evaluation criteria. The final overall score is a composite reflecting these considerations, giving a fair assessment of the translation quality as a whole.
