    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and conveys the dialogue structure clearly. Sentence lengths are reasonable and the flow mirrors the original French. Minor issues arise in a few places where word choice or punctuation slightly disrupts smooth reading (e.g., “El ajuste” alone could be confusing, “en bastidores” is a bit clunky). Overall, the content is understandable to a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly naturally. However, some expressions feel slightly literal or awkward: “El ajuste” instead of “ajuste fino”, “en bastidores” is uncommon, and the phrasing “se abre una nueva ventana de discusión” could be more idiomatic (“se abre una nueva conversación”). The grammar is correct, but the flow could be polished in a few spots to match typical conversational Spanish.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled appropriately and consistently: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\". There is clear explanation of concepts like in-context learning, and no major terminology errors. Minor improvement could be the use of “finetuning” as “ajuste fino” instead of just “ajuste”.",

    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator kept the original intent and tone. Cultural references are neutral and suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience. The adaptation is faithful, with only small stylistic choices that might differ from regional variants. The overall message and humor are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No essential information is omitted. All key points from the French script are present, including explanations of pre-training, fine-tuning, transfer learning, in-context learning, grounding, and the memory feature. The translation does not add unnecessary content and maintains concise clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of good quality, accurately conveying the technical content and maintaining the conversational flow of the original podcast. Some minor linguistic refinements could enhance naturalness, but the main strengths are faithful terminology and clear exposition. The Spanish version is accessible to the target audience while preserving the original meaning and nuance. Overall, it achieves a strong level of quality suitable for a broadcast audience in Spanish-speaking regions, with a few small opportunities for polish to reach a flawless standard.\n\nOverall Score: 17/20"
