  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish transcript is largely clear and follows the original structure. Sentences are mostly short and logically organized, allowing readers to grasp the progression of ideas. Only a few long sentences could be broken up for even smoother reading, but overall comprehension is good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly natural for native Spanish speakers. However, some phrases are slightly literal or awkward: \"afianzamiento\" for fine‑tuning, repeated capitalisation of \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\", and the construction \"es una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\" feels clunky. Vocabulary is mostly appropriate, but a few word choices could be refined for smoother flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"memoria a corto plazo\" are all standard. The choice of \"afianzamiento\" for fine‑tuning is uncommon (normally \"ajuste fino\"), and \"fundamentación\" for grounding is not the usual translation. Consistency is slightly affected by these choices, but overall terminology is understandable.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the intent and informal tone of the original podcast. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is largely straightforward. Minor opportunities for localisation exist (e.g., using \"ajuste fino\" instead of \"afianzamiento\"), but the Spanish version effectively conveys the purpose and meaning.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present in the Spanish version. No significant content has been omitted, and redundant repetitions (e.g., of \"aprendizaje en contexto\") are minimal. The translation remains concise while keeping the essential information intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid overall, successfully conveying the podcast's content. While readability and completeness are strong, some terminology choices and a few phrasing issues slightly diminish fluency. With minor refinements—especially in technical vocabulary—the translation would reach a more polished, natural level."
