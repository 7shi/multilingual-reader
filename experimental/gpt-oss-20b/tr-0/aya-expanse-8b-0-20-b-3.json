    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is overall coherent and easy to follow for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Sentences are short and the narrative structure mirrors the original French dialogue. However, occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., *\"copiar para un examen\"*, *\"lo que se dice\"* versus *\"se dijo\"*) slightly hampers fluidity. The use of a mix of formal and informal tone is appropriate for a podcast, but the interjection of a French word (*l'équilibre*) breaks the linguistic flow. Overall, readability is solid but not flawless.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the Spanish translation reads naturally, with appropriate vocabulary for technical concepts. Yet there are several points where the translation feels clunky or grammatically incorrect: *\"no necesita que te recuerden las leyes de l'équilibre\"* (mixes Spanish and French), *\"el aprendizaje en contexto es como copiar para un examen\"* (literal but slightly awkward), and the misuse of the exclamation mark at the end. These errors reduce the overall fluency but do not render the text incomprehensible.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *ICL*, *memoria a corto plazo*, and *transfer learning* are correctly translated and consistently used throughout. The translation retains the meaning of *grounding* and *memory* functions. The only slip is the accidental inclusion of a French word (*l'équilibre*). Otherwise, terminology is accurate and appropriate for a general audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the overall intent and conversational style of the original podcast. Cultural adaptation is generally adequate, but the change from *Tech Éclair* to *Tech Luz* distorts the original brand name, which could confuse listeners. Additionally, the translation occasionally uses literal wording that does not reflect idiomatic Spanish usage. These small missteps slightly weaken contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original dialogue are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the concept of grounding, the nature of temporary versus permanent knowledge, and the discussion of memory features. No critical information is omitted, and the translation is concise without unnecessary repetition. Minor phrasing issues do not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality overall, effectively conveying the technical concepts and conversational tone of the original French podcast. It maintains clarity and completeness, though it contains a few linguistic errors and a brand name mistake that should be corrected. With minor revisions—especially removing the French interjection and restoring the original podcast name—the translation would be excellent for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The average score across criteria is 16.2/20, indicating solid proficiency with room for polish in fluency and contextual fidelity. The translation is ready for use with a brief proofread to address the identified issues. This demonstrates a strong grasp of both source and target language, suitable for a technical but accessible podcast audience. Overall, the translation meets most of the evaluation criteria satisfactorily, delivering a coherent and informative listening experience for Spanish speakers. The main improvement area is ensuring consistency in terminology usage and avoiding inadvertent language mixing, particularly for brand names and key concepts. Once corrected, the translation would be an excellent resource for Spanish‑speaking audiences interested in AI and technology."
