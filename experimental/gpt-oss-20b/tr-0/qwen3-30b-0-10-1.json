  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text follows a logical sequence and most sentences are clear and easy to understand. The dialogue structure is preserved, making the content accessible to a general audience. Some sentences are slightly choppy because a few connectors are missing (e.g., *« La IA no está constantemente ajustada por sus conversaciones. Eso sería increíblemente ineficaz. »* could be smoother). Nonetheless, the overall readability is very high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall, the translation sounds natural and the punctuation with exclamation and question marks is correct. However, there are a few less‑fluid phrases, such as *« La IA no está constantemente ajustada por sus conversaciones. »* and *« se ajusta a partir de tus conversaciones. »*. These would read better as *« La IA no se ajusta constantemente a partir de tus conversaciones, pues eso sería ineficiente. »*. The vocabulary is appropriate, but a few word choices could be improved for smoother flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled accurately and consistently: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *ventana de contexto*, *anclaje* (grounding), *transferencia* (transfer learning). The translation matches the level of the target audience and no confusing jargon is introduced. Minor inconsistency: the French word *affinage* is translated as *ajuste fino* (instead of *finetuning*), which is acceptable, but the term is used consistently throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adopts Spanish conventions (use of inverted punctuation, informal dialogue tone). Cultural references are kept neutral and the overall intent is preserved. The adaptation could be slightly stronger in a few areas, such as replacing *« se acuerda »* with *« recuerda »*, which is more idiomatic. However, the message remains clear and culturally appropriate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory feature explanation, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No major omissions or additions that distort the meaning. Some small nuances (e.g., hyphenation of *pre‑entrenamiento*) are minor formatting issues rather than substantive ones.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely faithful and understandable. It preserves the dialogue format, technical explanations, and the original intent. Fluency could be polished in a few spots, and a more idiomatic choice of certain verbs would enhance naturalness. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience with a general or technical interest in AI concepts. The score reflects a strong performance with room for fine‑tuning in fluency and contextual nuance. 17.8/20.0"
