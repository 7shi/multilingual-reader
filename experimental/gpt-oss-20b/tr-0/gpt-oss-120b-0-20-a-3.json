  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and follows a logical sentence structure. The content is easy to follow for a native reader, though a few grammatical slips (e.g., \"consiste a\" instead of \"consiste en\") slightly reduce clarity. Overall, readers can understand the concepts without much effort.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for the most part. Minor issues such as the mix of formal and informal address, the phrase \"Se puede decir eso\" and the slightly awkward \"Cuando empiezas\" reduce overall fluency. However, it remains smooth and coherent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately rendered – \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL\" – and are consistently used. There are no misused terms or missing explanations that a target‑audience would need.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts idiomatic expressions appropriately (e.g., \"levantar el velo\", \"consultor temporal\"). Cultural references are kept neutral and suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. The tone remains consistent with the original, though the formality level sometimes fluctuates.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French original is present; no sections are omitted. Minor nuances such as tense choices are preserved. Redundancy is minimal and content stays concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is very good and largely faithful to the original. Small grammatical and stylistic adjustments would bring it to a flawless level, but it already conveys the intended meaning clearly, uses correct terminology, and adapts well to the target audience."
