    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the conversational flow of the original French script, using clear and simple language. Sentences are mostly short and logical, making complex ideas (e.g., pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) easy to grasp. Minor typographical quirks (e.g., inconsistent use of exclamation marks at sentence beginnings) do not impede comprehension. Overall, readers can follow the dialogue without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but there are a few stylistic and grammatical slips. The mix of formal “usted” in one sentence and informal “tú” elsewhere creates inconsistency. Some phrases are literal (“¡Ahí es donde entra en juego…”) and feel a bit stiff, and the repeated use of exclamation marks at the start of lines, while reflecting the original script’s style, can sound over‑dramatic. Nonetheless, the text reads smoothly overall.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste\" (fine‑tuning), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL), and \"ancoraje\" (grounding) all match common Spanish parlance. The translation stays consistent across the dialogue. Minor issues include the translation of “memory” as simply \"Memoria\" without clarifying its function, but this does not hinder understanding.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue’s intent is well preserved; the Spanish version keeps the informal, podcast‑style tone appropriate for casual listeners. Cultural adaptation is adequate: idioms and analogies (e.g., consulting, bicycle training) translate smoothly. The only minor mismatch is the formal vs. informal pronoun switch, which slightly reduces cultural cohesion but does not alter the message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script appear in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the translation includes the same explanations, examples, and concluding remarks. Some explanatory nuances (e.g., the inefficiency of continuous fine‑tuning) are retained. No unnecessary repetition was added, keeping the dialogue concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the original’s meaning with good fidelity and readability. It handles technical terminology correctly and keeps the conversational tone appropriate for a podcast audience. Minor fluency issues—especially the informal/formal pronoun mix and some literal phrasing—prevent a perfect score, but the overall quality is strong and suitable for native speakers. A small polish on style would elevate the translation to near‑flawless level. Overall, it is an accurate and comprehensible rendition of the original French dialogue, well adapted to Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\nTotal score: 17/20. The translation is clear, largely fluent, and faithful to the source material, with just a few stylistic refinements recommended for optimal naturalness."
