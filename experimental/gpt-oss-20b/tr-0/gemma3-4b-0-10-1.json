    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is overall easy to read and the logical flow of the original conversation is preserved. Some sentence structures are slightly clunky (e.g., “se olvida todo.” instead of “se olvida de todo.”) and punctuation could be tightened, but these minor issues do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a Spanish speaker in most parts, but there are occasional awkward choices such as “una nota al pie” (more idiomatic would be “una nota al margen” or “una nota de pie”). Some verb forms (“se olvida todo”) feel truncated. Overall, the tone is conversational and appropriate, but a few refinements would improve smoothness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: “pre-entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje en contexto” (ICL), “ventana de contexto”, “anclaje”, “memoria a corto plazo”. The terminology remains consistent throughout and matches standard Spanish usage in AI contexts. The only minor inconsistency is the occasional use of “finetuning” in English instead of “ajuste fino.”",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content to Spanish-speaking audiences, keeping the original intent and humor. Cultural references are appropriately translated (e.g., “consultor brillante” instead of “consultant brillant”). The meta‑note about a Spanish exclamation is omitted, but it is not part of the conversational content, so this is acceptable. Overall, contextual adaptation is good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present in the Spanish version. No major facts or explanations were omitted. Minor stylistic adjustments were made for clarity, and redundancy was largely avoided. The translation captures the full dialogue flow and technical explanations.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and faithful to the original. It preserves the conversational tone and technical explanations while making the content accessible to a Spanish-speaking audience. Minor fluency tweaks and some punctuation polish would elevate the quality, but as it stands it is competent and clear. The scoring reflects a high-quality translation with room for small refinements."
