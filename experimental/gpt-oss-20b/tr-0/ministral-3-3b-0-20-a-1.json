    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and follows the original dialogue structure closely. Sentences are generally short and logical, and the script’s conversational tone is preserved. However, a few phrases feel a bit stilted (“si quiero que tenga conocimiento de las mismas informaciones mañana”) which slightly hampers fluid comprehension for a native audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the majority of the translation reads naturally, some constructions are awkward or contain literal English phrasing (e.g., “anti-sèche”, “se inserta automáticamente esos extractos en el prompt”). Word choice is generally appropriate but occasionally feels too literal (“aprendizaje por transferencia” is fine, but “aprendizaje en contexto” could be rendered more idiomatically as “aprendizaje en contexto” or “aprendizaje contextual”). These small issues reduce overall fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled mostly correctly – “pre-entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “grounding” (anclaje) are all accurate. Consistency is largely maintained, though the translation switches between “ajuste fino” and “ajustar un modelo” a bit. The use of both the Spanish and English acronyms (ICL) is appropriate for a bilingual technical audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and the playful, explanatory tone of the podcast. Cultural references are minimal, but the adaptation to Spanish is generally smooth, with only minor awkwardness in a few phrases. No major cultural disconnects are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are included. The translation does not omit any critical information, and it provides adequate explanations for complex concepts. Redundancies are largely avoided, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation delivers the core message accurately and retains the conversational style of the original. Some sentences, however, could benefit from more natural phrasing to enhance readability and fluency. Consistency in terminology and a few stylistic tweaks would elevate the quality to near‑perfect."
