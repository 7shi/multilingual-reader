  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text preserves the original dialogue flow and sentence structure, making it easy to follow for native speakers. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in a straightforward way, mirroring the French original. Minor wording choices (e.g., “el espacio de trabajo temporal” instead of “el espacio de trabajo temporal”) are clear, and the overall readability is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly naturally, but a few phrases feel slightly literal or awkward: \"El sistema busca rápidamente en tus antiguos intercambios\" and \"inserta automáticamente estos extractos en el prompt, entre bambalinas\". Some sentences use a past passive construction that is not idiomatic in Spanish (“Se le ha enviado una IA totalmente nueva a la escuela”). Overall, however, the tone is conversational and familiar to Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled appropriately: pre‑training → pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning → ajuste fino, transfer learning → aprendizaje por transferencia, context window → ventana de contexto, ICL → aprendizaje en contexto, grounding → anclaje, memory → memoria. Terminology is consistent throughout the text, and no significant terms are omitted or mistranslated.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator keeps the informal, conversational style of the original, respecting the podcast’s tone. Cultural references are adapted adequately; for instance, the phrase \"el espacio de trabajo temporal\" reflects a colloquial way of describing short‑term memory. The only slight drawback is that the original playful punctuation (“¡Exactamente!”) is sometimes omitted, but overall the intent and humor are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue turns from the French original are present, and no substantive information is omitted. The translator also keeps the narrative structure and logical progression intact, ensuring the listener receives the same details about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, and memory functions. Redundancies are avoided and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, accurately conveying the original meaning and tone while preserving the technical detail. Minor fluency issues and some slightly literal phrasing do not impede understanding, making the text suitable for a native Spanish audience. Overall, it scores well across all criteria, reflecting a competent and faithful adaptation of the source material."
