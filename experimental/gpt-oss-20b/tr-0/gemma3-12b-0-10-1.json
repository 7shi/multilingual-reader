  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and follows a logical sentence structure. The dialogue flow is preserved, and the explanations of concepts such as pre‑training and fine‑tuning are understandable to a general audience. Some sentences are a bit long, but overall the content is easy to read.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are a few awkward or literal expressions: e.g., \"Lo olvida todo\" (instead of a more natural \"Lo olvidará todo\"), and the repetition of \"Lo olvidará\" in the same paragraph could feel redundant. Overall, however, the language is fluent and appropriate for native speakers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately rendered: \"ajuste fino\" for fine‑tuning, \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\" for grounding. The terminology is consistent throughout the text, and no essential terms are missing. Minor improvements could be made for clarity (e.g., “memoria a corto plazo” could be “memoria a corto plazo” is fine).",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references well. French idioms are replaced with Spanish equivalents (“un joven universitario recién graduado” instead of “un joven universitario recién graduado”) and references to a consultant are retained. No major cultural mismatches are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present. The dialogue structure, speaker cues, and explanations of ICL, fine‑tuning, and memory features are faithfully reproduced. The translation does not add unnecessary content and keeps the text concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality. It retains the meaning, flow, and tone of the original French while being understandable to Spanish‑speaking audiences. Minor refinements in fluency and a bit more natural phrasing could raise the score even further, but overall it meets the requirements well and serves its purpose as an engaging podcast script in Spanish. Overall, a solid translation that could be used as is with only light proofreading adjustments needed for maximum naturalness and conciseness. This makes the translation an excellent representation of the source text for a Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\nOverall score: 17/20 (average of the individual scores)."
