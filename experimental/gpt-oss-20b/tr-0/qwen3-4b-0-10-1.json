  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the conversational flow of the original French podcast script. Sentences are generally short and logical, and technical concepts are introduced in a way that a Spanish‑speaking audience would understand. However, some compound sentences (e.g., the explanation of ICL) could be broken up for extra clarity, and occasional word order feels slightly mechanical, which slightly lowers the score.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The overall translation reads smoothly for native speakers, with most idiomatic expressions correctly rendered. Minor awkwardnesses appear in phrases such as “le dar simplemente los documentos” and the use of “en el que” instead of “en el cual” in a few places. Some duplicated words (e.g., “por lo tanto” appears twice in quick succession) reduce naturalness. Vocabulary choice is appropriate and contemporary.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: ‘pre-entrenamiento’, ‘afinamiento’, ‘aprendizaje por transferencia’, ‘aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)’, ‘anclaje’, ‘memoria’ are all accurate and consistently used. Explanations for these terms mirror the French original and are clear for the target audience. No major mis‑translation or missing technical detail.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation takes into account Spanish‑speaking cultural references and avoids literal translation pitfalls. Expressions such as “consultor brillante” and “experto permanente” are appropriate for the context. However, the phrase “Hola y bienvenido en” should read “Hola y bienvenido a” for perfect cultural nuance, slightly reducing the score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French text are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory mechanisms, and the analogy between a consultant and an expert. No substantive content was omitted, and the translation adds no extraneous information. The redundancy is minimal.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the Spanish translation is highly faithful to the original French script, maintaining its tone, structure, and technical detail. Minor fluency and contextual quirks exist, but they do not impede comprehension. The translation would be suitable for a native Spanish audience in a podcast setting."
