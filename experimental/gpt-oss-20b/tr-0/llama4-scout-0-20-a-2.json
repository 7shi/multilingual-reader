  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and the sentence structure is logical. Some long sentences could be split for better flow, but overall readers can understand the content without confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds mostly natural to a native Spanish speaker, though a few phrases feel slightly awkward or literal (e.g., \"le enviamos una IA totalmente nueva a la escuela\", \"una ayuda\" instead of a more idiomatic term). Overall, the language is smooth and contemporary.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", and \"grounding\" are correctly rendered and consistent throughout. Minor issues include the translation of \"anti‑sèche\" as \"una ayuda\" which loses a bit of nuance.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the original intent and is culturally appropriate for a Spanish-speaking audience. Some expressions could be further adapted for local idioms, but the overall message is clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present; no critical information is omitted. A small nuance about the \"anti‑sèche\" could be clarified, but overall the content is complete and concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality and effectively conveys the original content. It could benefit from minor refinements in phrasing and terminology to achieve even greater naturalness and precision, but it remains a solid, readable Spanish rendition of the French script."
