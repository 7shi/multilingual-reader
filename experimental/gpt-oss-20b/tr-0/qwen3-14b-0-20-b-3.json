  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and understandable. Sentence structure is mostly logical, and the dialogue format is preserved. Minor issues such as missing commas after introductory clauses slightly reduce flow, but overall readers can follow the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds fairly natural, but there are a few awkward phrasings: \"le dio la cultura general\" feels literal, \"le tienen la impresión de que la IA se acuerda\" is clunky, and the plural \"informaciones\" is uncommon in Spanish. Vocabulary is appropriate, yet some sentences could be smoother. These minor idiosyncrasies lower the fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly – \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\" – and they are consistent throughout. The only minor issue is the plural form \"informaciones\" versus the singular \"información\". No significant misunderstandings appear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the original intent and tone, adapting expressions to Spanish-speaking listeners. Cultural references are neutral and fit the context. A few colloquial phrasings could be improved for a more native feel, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are present: pretraining, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory functions, and the consultant vs. permanent expert analogy. No essential information is omitted, and redundancies are minimal.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original content accurately and is largely readable and coherent. Minor linguistic refinements would improve naturalness, but the overall quality is strong and suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience."
