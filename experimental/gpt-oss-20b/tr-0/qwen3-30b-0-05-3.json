  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version follows the French dialogue closely and is generally easy to understand. The sentence structure is mostly logical, but a few grammatical slips (e.g., missing accent in “¿Porque”, incorrect word order in “justo antes de que comenzara a hablarte”) slightly reduce clarity. The dialogue still flows naturally for a native reader, so the overall readability is strong, though not flawless.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads well and uses common expressions, but there are a handful of unnatural phrasings and minor syntax errors that make it feel slightly mechanical. For example, “¿Porque ya entiende” should be “¿Por qué ya entiende?” and “se le proporcionan una hoja de trucos justo antes de que comenzara a hablarte” would sound smoother as “se le proporciona una hoja de trucos justo antes de que comience a hablarte.” These issues reduce fluency marginally. Overall, the translation is fluent but with room for polish.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and translated appropriately: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\" (for fine‑tuning), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"anclaje\" are all suitable. Consistency is maintained across the transcript, and explanations are clear enough for the target audience. Minor issues such as the hyphen in \"pre-entrenamiento\" do not detract from comprehension. Therefore, terminology handling is very good.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the informal, conversational tone of the original and adapts cultural references (e.g., consulting analogies) appropriately for Spanish‑speaking listeners. It does not introduce culturally inappropriate content and maintains the intended humor. Slight adjustments could improve naturalness, but overall the contextual adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All lines of the original dialogue are present in the translation, with no significant omissions. The speaker names and key remarks are kept intact. Redundancies were avoided, and the content remains concise while fully conveying the original meaning. Thus, the translation is complete.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and largely faithful to the source text. It captures the conversational flow, uses appropriate technical terminology, and preserves the speaker dynamics. Minor grammatical quirks and slightly awkward phrasings slightly hinder readability and fluency, but these do not significantly compromise overall comprehension. With minor refinements, the Spanish version would be polished and natural for native listeners. Overall, a good job with room for fine‑tuning in fluency and grammatical accuracy. 16.2/20 overall score is appropriate for the quality of this translation, given the minor issues identified. The translation meets the essential criteria for clarity, accuracy, and contextual relevance, but could be improved by smoothing out a few awkward constructions and correcting minor punctuation errors. 16.2/20."
