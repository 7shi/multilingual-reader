  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the flow mimics the original dialogue. Minor wording choices could be smoother, but overall the reader can grasp the concepts without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Grammar is mostly correct, and the vocabulary is contemporary. Occasional phrasing such as \"Aprendizaje In-Contexto\" feels slightly forced, yet the overall text remains fluid.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", \"memoria a corto plazo\". The main issue is the mistranslated acronym: the original \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\" was rendered as \"AIC (Aprendizaje In‑Contexto)\", which is inconsistent and may confuse readers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts idiomatic expressions to Spanish (e.g., \"consultor brillante\") and retains the conversational tone. Cultural references are minimal, and the adaptation does not distort the original intent. A few awkward turns remain but do not significantly hinder understanding.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French source are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, context‑based learning, grounding, and memory features. The only omission is the incorrect acronym, which does not remove substantive content. Redundancy is avoided and the message stays concise.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers a clear, fluent, and mostly accurate rendition of the original French script. While most technical terms are handled well, the mislabeling of the ICL acronym is a notable error that could mislead readers. Otherwise, the Spanish version preserves the tone, context, and completeness of the source material, making it suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience who seeks to understand the nuances of AI learning methods and memory features in conversational agents. The overall quality is high, with room for minor refinements in terminology consistency and idiomatic phrasing. 17/20 is a fair reflection of the translation’s strengths and minor shortcomings.  The score is calculated as the average of the five individual criteria scores (83/5 ≈ 16.6, rounded to 17)."
