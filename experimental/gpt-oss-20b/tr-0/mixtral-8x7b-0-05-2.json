  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely understandable, with clear sentence structure and logical flow. However, some phrases feel slightly awkward or literal (e.g., \"La IA no se está afilando por tus conversaciones\" instead of a more natural expression like \"el modelo no está afinándose\"). These minor issues slightly reduce readability, but overall the target audience can follow the content without confusion.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the text reads smoothly and sounds natural to a Spanish speaker. Still, there are a few awkward constructions and literal word choices such as \"se podría decir que sí\" and the misuse of \"afilando\". The presence of some untranslated English terms (fine‑tuning) is acceptable but could be better integrated. The overall fluency is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, memoria a corto plazo. There is a small slip with \"afilando\" instead of \"ajustando/afinando\". Consistency is maintained throughout, and no major misunderstandings occur.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and style, using Spanish idiomatic expressions where appropriate. Some cultural nuances (e.g., comparing to a consultant) are preserved. Minor linguistic adjustments could improve the adaptation, but the overall contextual meaning is well conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present. No significant omissions are observed. The translation sometimes paraphrases slightly (e.g., \"memoria a corto plazo\" for \"mémoire à usage unique\"), but this does not affect understanding. Redundancy is kept minimal, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and conveys the technical content accurately. Minor linguistic inaccuracies and some literal phrasing slightly detract from readability and fluency, but the overall meaning is preserved. With a few refinements—particularly in natural expression of certain phrases and consistent terminology usage—the translation could reach a higher level of polish and professionalism. Overall, it is a solid, serviceable translation suitable for a general audience interested in AI concepts, though it would benefit from a final proofread to address the identified quirks and enhance naturalness."
