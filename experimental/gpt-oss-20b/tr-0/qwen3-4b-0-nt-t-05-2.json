    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, with clear sentence structure and logical flow. However, a few awkward phrasings (e.g., “se envía una IA… a la escuela”) slightly hinder readability, yet most readers can follow the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several non‑natural expressions and minor grammatical errors (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en”, “Apena” instead of “apenas”). The overall tone is conversational but some sentences read as literal literalisms of the French original, reducing fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved (preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL). Minor inconsistencies appear (e.g., “aprender el francés” vs “aprender el francés” is fine, but “afinado” could be clearer as “afineamiento”). The glossary is generally consistent, with some missing parenthetical explanations that could aid comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator keeps the informal podcast style and maintains cultural references. Some idiomatic nuances could be improved (“¡Hola y bienvenido en” should be “¡Hola y bienvenidos a”). Overall, the adaptation preserves the original intent and tone.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present; no essential information was omitted. The Spanish version retains the dialogue structure and explanations. Minor redundancy is present but does not obscure meaning.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and mostly faithful to the original French text. While readability and terminology are strong, fluency suffers from a few awkward constructions that could be smoothed out. Minor adjustments would bring the translation to a higher level of naturalness for Spanish‑speaking audiences."
