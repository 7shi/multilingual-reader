  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the overall structure and conveys the main ideas clearly. Sentence flow is generally logical, and the use of everyday language makes complex concepts approachable. Some awkward phrasing (e.g., “de la que” and “partes de un contexto vacío”) slightly hampers readability, but the text remains understandable to Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural and the vocabulary is contemporary. However, a few expressions feel literal or slightly incorrect (e.g., “de la que” instead of “que”, “se mal comprende”, “Es una memoria a uso único”). These minor issues reduce the overall smoothness of the dialogue.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"in‑context learning\" are correctly rendered. Consistency is maintained throughout. The translation occasionally introduces synonyms (“estudiar a última hora” for “bachoter”), which is helpful for comprehension. No critical terminology errors detected.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the conversational tone of the original French podcast. Cultural references (e.g., “un consultor brillante”) are appropriately localized. Minor issues like the capitalization of « Memoria » and the phrase “Es una memoria a uso único” slightly deviate from standard Spanish usage, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential points from the original are present, including the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No substantive content was omitted, and the dialogue maintains the same length and detail.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the essence of the original French dialogue and presents it in a clear, mostly natural manner. While the text is largely accurate, a handful of grammatical slips and slightly awkward phrasing slightly lower its overall polish. With minor revisions, it could reach an excellent level of quality for a native Spanish-speaking audience."
