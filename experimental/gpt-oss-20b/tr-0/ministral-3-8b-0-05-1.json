  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to read, with clear sentence structures and simple vocabulary that captures the meaning of the original. Some sentences are slightly long, but they remain comprehensible to a Spanish-speaking audience. Minor improvements could be made in sentence pacing, but overall the text is readable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation flows naturally for native speakers, with appropriate idiomatic expressions and grammar. Occasional choices like \"Todo está claro\" or \"El afinado\" feel slightly informal or atypical, yet they do not impede comprehension. The overall fluency is high, but a few words could be refined for smoother style.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine-tuning\", \"ICL (In-Context Learning)\" and \"grounding\" are correctly rendered. The term \"afinado\" could be replaced by the more common \"ajuste fino\", but it remains understandable. Consistency is maintained throughout the text.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Cultural references are appropriately adapted, e.g., \"consultor\" for \"consultant\" and natural phrasing for Spanish speakers. The core intent and humor of the original are preserved. Some expressions could be slightly more idiomatic, but the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French text are present in the Spanish version, with no significant omissions. Minor explanatory details are kept, and redundancies are largely avoided. The translation remains concise while conveying the full content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate, clear, and generally fluent. Minor tweaks could enhance naturalness and terminology consistency, but the overall quality meets a high standard for professional translation. The text effectively communicates the original ideas in Spanish without losing nuance or detail. Overall, a solid 18.5/20 performance with room for fine‑tuning in style and word choice."
