    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally easy to follow, but a few odd word choices such as *crunchar* (which is not a Spanish verb for studying) and *cachotaje* (an unfamiliar borrowed term) can momentarily confuse readers. The overall sentence structure is logical, but these lexical quirks reduce clarity slightly. Score: 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text flows well in most parts, but there are several awkward or incorrect expressions: *cachotaje* instead of a natural term, *crunchar* instead of *estudiar intensamente*, and the grammatical mistake *la IA no se afinan* (should be *no se afina*). These issues make the translation feel less natural to a native speaker. Score: 13/20.",

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms are preserved accurately (*pre-entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *anclaje*). However, the incorrect *crunchar* and the non‑standard *cachotaje* compromise terminological precision. The consistency of term usage is good overall. Score: 14/20.",

    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the conversational tone and respects cultural conventions (e.g., Spanish punctuation, colloquial expressions). It adapts the original intent well, though the odd lexical choices slightly undermine adaptation. Score: 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original is present; no significant omissions are detected. The translation adds no unnecessary repetition and preserves the dialogue flow. Minor errors do not affect the completeness. Score: 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material and conveys the core concepts effectively. Nonetheless, lexical inaccuracies (*crunchar*, *cachotaje*) and a few grammatical slips detract from readability and fluency. With careful revision of these terms, the translation could reach a higher standard of naturalness and precision. Overall, it is competent but not flawless, reflecting a mid‑to‑high quality effort that would benefit from a final proofreading pass to correct the identified issues."
