  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version follows the original structure and is easy to understand. Sentences are clear and the flow is logical. Minor repetitive phrasing (“en el aprendizaje en contexto…”) slightly reduces readability, but overall the text is well‑comprehended.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most expressions sound natural and the grammar is mostly correct. A few awkward constructions appear (“para la única conversación”) and the use of articles before “aprendizaje en contexto” is slightly unnatural for some native speakers. Vocabulary choice is generally appropriate, though a few wordings could be smoother.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, grounding, memoria). The translation uses equivalent Spanish terms and explains them adequately. Consistency is good, but the term “fine‑tuning” appears only once as “ajuste fino” and the acronym ICL is kept in English, which is acceptable for a technical audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation respects cultural context and keeps the original intent. The explanatory analogies are translated faithfully and remain relevant for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor adjustments could be made to better fit Spanish idioms, but overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant content is omitted. All key points of the original script are present, including explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. The translation remains concise while preserving detail.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the technical concepts and conversational tone of the original French script. Minor improvements in fluency and article usage could bring it to a perfect score, but it is already comprehensible and suitable for a native Spanish audience."
