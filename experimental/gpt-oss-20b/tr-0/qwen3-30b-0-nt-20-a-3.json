    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and easy to read. The sentence structure follows the original fairly closely, and the explanations of complex concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) are understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor issues include inconsistent hyphenation of compounds such as *preentrenamiento* (sometimes written without a hyphen) and occasional long sentences that could be broken up for easier parsing. Overall, the text is readable with a few minor tweaks needed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation flows well and sounds natural in most places. However, some phrases feel slightly awkward or literal, e.g., *“la IA no se ajusta constantemente a través de sus conversaciones”* could be more idiomatic. There are a few missing accent marks (*“la IA”* is correct, but *“consultora”* would be better as *consultora*). Vocabulary choices are appropriate, but the mix of English and Spanish terminology (e.g., *In‑Context Learning*) might feel jarring to some readers. Overall, the translation is fluent but not flawless.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly and consistently. The translator kept *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, and *anclaje* in Spanish, while retaining *In‑Context Learning* and *grounding* as English loan‑words. This mix is acceptable in a technical context but could be fully translated (*aprendizaje en contexto*, *enraizamiento*) for consistency. No major terms were omitted or mistranslated, and explanations are adequate.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone of the podcast. Cultural adaptation is minimal but appropriate; the Spanish speakers would recognize the metaphor of a consultant and the analogy with a cyclist. There is no loss of meaning, and idiomatic expressions are generally suitable. Minor improvements could involve localizing some phrasing (e.g., *“consultor brillante”* → *consultor excepcional*), but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key points from the French original are present in the Spanish version. No essential information is omitted. The translator kept the same number of dialogue turns and retained the structure of the conversation. Some sentences are slightly re‑ordered or expanded for clarity, but redundancy is not introduced. The translation is concise yet complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material and effectively conveys its meaning to a Spanish‑speaking audience. While readability and fluency are strong, minor issues with hyphenation, occasional awkward phrasing, and a blend of English/Spanish terminology slightly lower the overall quality. With a few polishing adjustments, the translation would reach an excellent level of naturalness and technical accuracy. The work is competent and largely faithful to the original, suitable for publication or use in a professional podcast setting with only minor refinements needed."
