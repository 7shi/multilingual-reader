  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely understandable to Spanish speakers, but several typos (e.g., \"conocencias\") and awkward phrasing (e.g., \"bacheo\") disrupt the flow. The overall structure and logical progression remain clear, yet minor errors reduce ease of comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most sentences are grammatically correct, some expressions feel forced or non‑native (e.g., \"el aprendizaje en contexto, es el bacheo\", \"le hicieron una 'antisèche'\"). These issues lower the naturalness of the translation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly rendered. However, there are mistakes with words like \"conocencias\" (should be \"conocimientos\") and the use of \"bacheo\" instead of a more appropriate phrase, which affect consistency and clarity.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The core intent of the original script is preserved, but the translation inconsistently changes the podcast title from \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Tech Flash\" in the opening and then back to the original, confusing the audience. Cultural adaptation is otherwise adequate, but this inconsistency detracts from the overall adaptation quality.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the source is present; nothing significant is omitted. The text remains concise and the redundancy is minimal, though a few stylistic choices (e.g., repeated use of \"el modelo\" and \"la IA\") could be trimmed for brevity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the original meaning but is marred by several typographical and idiomatic errors that impede readability and naturalness. Consistency issues—particularly with the podcast title—should be addressed. With minor revisions, the translation could reach a higher quality level suitable for native listeners of a technical podcast. The overall score reflects solid information delivery but recognizes room for improvement in fluency and contextual accuracy. The average score across criteria is 14/20, indicating a good but not outstanding translation effort. A final polish would elevate the translation to professional standards, ensuring clarity, consistency, and natural flow for Spanish-speaking audiences."
