  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and easy to follow. Most sentences stay close to the original structure, making it straightforward for native listeners to grasp the concepts. A few long clauses could be broken down for extra clarity, which is why the score is not perfect.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall flow is natural and the translation reads smoothly. Minor stylistic quirks appear, such as \"estudiar de memoria\" and occasional literal renderings that feel slightly stiff. Nonetheless, the text feels coherent and conversational enough for a podcast audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately translated (preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, anclaje, memoria a corto plazo) and consistently used throughout. Paraphrases are provided where needed (e.g., explaining grounding), ensuring the target audience understands.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation respects cultural context; idiomatic expressions are mostly appropriate and the intent of the original is preserved. Some small adjustments (e.g., avoiding overly colloquial words) could improve the feel, but the core meaning remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant content is omitted. The dialogue’s flow, humor, and key explanations are all present, and redundancy is minimal. The Spanish version mirrors the original’s structure and detail.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is a faithful and largely natural rendering of the original French script. Technical accuracy and clarity are strong, with only minor fluency and stylistic tweaks needed to reach perfection. This version should serve well for a native Spanish‑speaking audience while preserving the podcast’s engaging tone and explanatory depth. The average of the five criteria gives an overall score of 18.2 out of 20, reflecting a high‑quality translation suitable for professional use."
