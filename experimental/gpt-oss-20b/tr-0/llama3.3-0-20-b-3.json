  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally easy to read and follows the dialogue structure of the original. The Spanish sentences are understandable, though some long sentences could be split for smoother flow. Minor punctuation issues (e.g., missing accents on ‘masiva’) and occasional awkward phrasing slightly affect clarity, but overall the content is comprehensible.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural for Spanish speakers, but there are a few awkward expressions such as \"El aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL\" and the use of capitalised “Memoria” instead of the usual lowercase. These do not majorly impede understanding but reduce the fluidity of the prose. The vocabulary choice is appropriate and contemporary.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\" are all correctly rendered. Minor deviations such as using \"ancrage\" instead of \"anclaje\" and the choice of \"afinamiento\" over the more common \"ajuste fino\" are noted, but overall terminology is accurate and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent, preserves the podcast style, and adapts expressions to Spanish-speaking culture. The name \"Tech Éclair\" is retained, which is fine. Cultural references are neutral and no problematic terms appear. Overall adaptation is good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No major information is omitted, and the dialogue flow is preserved. Some small lexical omissions (e.g., a more explicit mention of \"también conocido como\") are present but do not detract from understanding. The content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and largely faithful to the original French script. It captures the dialogue’s tone and technical content well, with only minor issues in fluency and terminology usage that do not impede comprehension. A slight polishing of phrasing and consistent use of standard Spanish technical terms would bring the translation to near perfection."
