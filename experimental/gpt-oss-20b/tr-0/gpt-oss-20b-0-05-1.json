  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is generally clear and follows a logical sentence structure. The speaker roles and basic storyline are easy to follow for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor grammatical hiccups (e.g., “Lee” missing a preposition, gender mismatch in “la ajuste fino”) slightly impede smooth comprehension, but they do not obscure the meaning.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The language is mostly natural and contemporary, with idiomatic expressions such as *se hace posible* and *se le ha proporcionado*. However, a few constructions feel slightly clunky or incorrect: the use of *has entendido todo* (instead of *lo has entendido*) and the phrasing *una antisèche* (a French word left untranslated). These moments reduce the overall flow, but the bulk of the text reads smoothly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are preserved: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *In‑Context Learning*, *ventana de contexto*. The gender error with *ajuste fino* and the untranslated word *antisèche* are noticeable lapses. Otherwise, the translation provides understandable paraphrases for concepts such as transfer learning, grounding, and context memory, maintaining consistency across the dialogue.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent, adapting cultural references to a Spanish context (e.g., *Tech Éclair* stays unchanged). Expressions like *una consultora brillante* and the metaphor of a bicycle learning are well translated and culturally resonant. The adaptation could be improved by ensuring all idiomatic elements are fully localized, but overall it is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the source is present; no omissions are detected. The translation retains the dialogue’s structure and content, and where necessary, it expands on explanations (e.g., how ICL works). The only loss is the inadvertent inclusion of a foreign term (*antisèche*), which does not alter the factual content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and largely faithful to the original French text. Minor grammatical and terminological errors slightly diminish readability and fluency, but the core ideas and dialogue flow are preserved. A quick proof‑read to fix gender mismatches, prepositional omissions, and the untranslated word would bring the translation to an excellent level. Overall, a competent translation that effectively communicates the concepts to a Spanish‑speaking audience with a modest amount of polish needed to reach perfection. 16/20 points overall, with a suggested focus on consistency in terminology and minor grammatical corrections to enhance clarity and naturalness.
