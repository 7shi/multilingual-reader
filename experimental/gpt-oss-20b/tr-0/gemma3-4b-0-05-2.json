    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version keeps the dialogue format and introduces the concepts in a way that most Spanish‑speaking listeners can follow.  Sentences are generally short and logically ordered.  However, a few phrases feel slightly clunky (e.g., “el ajuste fino” instead of the more common “ajuste fino” in some contexts) and a couple of words are mismatched in gender (e.g., “una conocimiento”).  Overall, the text is easy to understand, though it could be smoother.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, but some expressions are awkward or incorrectly translated.  For example, “una esquela justo antes de que empiece a hablar contigo” is an odd choice for “a cheat sheet”; a better phrase would be “una referencia rápida” or “una nota rápida”.  The tense of “Olvidó todo” should be present (“Olvida todo”).  These small errors reduce the overall naturalness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding (anclaje), memoria, etc.  Terminology is consistent throughout and matches the target audience’s expected vocabulary.  Minor issues: the phrase “ajuste fino” appears slightly inconsistent with the more formal “ajuste fino”, but overall the terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the intent and humor of the original French dialogue, adapting idiomatic expressions (e.g., “un grand question” becomes “la gran pregunta”).  Cultural references are not problematic.  Some subtle nuance is lost (e.g., the original’s playful tone when saying “on oublie tout” becomes “Olvidó todo” instead of “Olvida todo”), but the overall message remains clear.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points of the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and memory features.  No major omissions are found.  Minor omissions or alterations in tense (present vs. past) slightly affect precision but do not change the overall meaning.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and largely faithful to the original.  It conveys the key ideas and keeps the conversational tone, but some awkward phrasing, gender mismatches, and tense inconsistencies detract from the polish.  With minor refinements—especially in terminology consistency and natural expression—the Spanish version could achieve a higher quality level.  It is suitable for an audience familiar with AI concepts but would benefit from a final proofread to eliminate the minor errors noted above.  Overall, a solid effort with room for improvement in fluency and precision.  Average score: 16.2/20 (rounded)."
