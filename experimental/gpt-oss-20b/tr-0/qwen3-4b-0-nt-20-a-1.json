    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, but some phrasing is awkward (e.g., “Bienvenido en” instead of “bienvenido a”) and a few sentences are slightly convoluted, which can momentarily confuse the reader. The overall structure follows the French dialogue closely, keeping the conversational flow. 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds generally natural, yet a few expressions feel literal or stilted. Examples: “Ha entendido todo” (should be “Lo has entendido todo”) and “una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto” are odd to a native Spanish speaker. The overall syntax is correct, but these small slips lower fluency. 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia* and *ventana de contexto* are correctly rendered. The term *grounding* is translated as *anclaje*, which is appropriate, though consistency in capitalization (*Aprendizaje en Contexto* vs *aprendizaje en contexto*) could be improved. Overall, terminology is accurate and consistent. 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the intent of the original, but some cultural/linguistic adjustments are missing. For instance, “Bienvenido en” should be “bienvenido a”, and the opening greeting could use the plural “bienvenidos” for the audience. The use of “¡Hola!” and the closing “¡Hasta pronto!” are appropriate, but overall adaptation is slightly below optimal. 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No substantive content is omitted; every line from the original is present and the key points are conveyed. Minor rephrasings do not change meaning. Redundancy is minimal. 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid overall: it preserves meaning, follows the dialogue structure, and uses correct technical vocabulary. Minor issues in readability and fluency—mostly due to literal phrasing and some punctuation—prevent it from being flawless. With slight refinements in expression and capitalization, the text would read more naturally to Spanish-speaking audiences."
