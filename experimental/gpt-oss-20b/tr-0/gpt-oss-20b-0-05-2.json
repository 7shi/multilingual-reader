  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation uses clear sentence structures that are easy to follow for a general audience. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in a straightforward manner. However, some long sentences could be broken up for even smoother readability. Overall, the text is comprehensible with only minor room for improvement.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for Spanish speakers. Grammar is generally correct and vocabulary is contemporary. Minor awkward phrasings appear (e.g., \"se le ha proporcionado una antisèche\" which feels slightly literal) but do not significantly hinder fluency. The overall flow is smooth and the style matches the informal podcast tone of the original.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\", and \"memoria\" are all appropriate Spanish equivalents. Terminology is used consistently throughout the text, and the abbreviations ICL are preserved. The only small inconsistency is the occasional literal carry‑over of the English term in parentheses, but this does not detract from clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone. Cultural adaptation is minimal but adequate; the Spanish audience can easily relate to the metaphor of a consultant and the concept of temporary memory. Some phrasing could be more idiomatic, but overall the contextual meaning is well conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No essential details are omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary information. The structure mirrors the original dialogue, maintaining clarity and conciseness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, accurately conveying the technical concepts and conversational tone of the original French script. While a few minor stylistic tweaks could enhance readability and naturalness, the translation is clear, fluent, and faithful to the source material. Overall, it serves the intended audience well and would be suitable for a professional podcast broadcast in Spanish. The average score reflects a strong translation with small areas for polish. 17/20."
