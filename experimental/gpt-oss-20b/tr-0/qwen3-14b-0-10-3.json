  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows a logical sentence order.  Some phrases, however, feel slightly awkward or stilted (“la IA no está constantemente afinada por sus conversaciones”), which can momentarily confuse readers.  Overall, readers can grasp the concepts but may pause on these oddities.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is fluent in most parts but includes a few unnatural word choices and grammatical slips—e.g., “se le proporcionó un apunte” and the accidental insertion of the French word *incroyablement*.  These errors interrupt the natural flow for a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly for the most part: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *grounding*.  The only minor slip is the use of *apunte* instead of a clearer term like *nota* or *apuntes*.  Consistency across the episode is good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The cultural adaptation is generally adequate; idiomatic expressions are used appropriately.  The use of French quotes (« … ») instead of Spanish (« … ») slightly reduces authenticity.  Overall, the intent and tone of the original are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French original are present.  No significant information is omitted, and the translation keeps the content concise while retaining the explanatory detail.  The small mistranslation of *apunte* does not materially alter the meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates solid fidelity to the source material and a good grasp of the technical content.  While mostly accurate, it contains a handful of awkward phrasing, minor lexical errors, and an accidental French word that detract from perfect fluency.  With a few edits—particularly in word choice and the correction of the French slip—the translation would be near‑perfect for native Spanish listeners."
