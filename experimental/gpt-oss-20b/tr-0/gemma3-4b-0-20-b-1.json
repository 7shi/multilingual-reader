    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely comprehensible and follows the original line‑by‑line structure, which helps readers track the dialogue.  However, some literal translations create awkward phrases such as “Olvidó todo” (instead of “Olvida todo”) and “Lo ha entendido todo” (which feels clunky).  The overall sentence flow is clear enough for native readers, but a few grammatical slips slightly hinder readability.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation reads naturally and uses contemporary vocabulary.  Yet, there are a few spots where the phrasing sounds literal or slightly off, e.g., “lo ha entendido todo” and the repetition of the capitalisation in “Aprendizaje en Contexto.”  These do not break comprehension but make the text feel less smooth compared to polished native prose.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are accurately translated: *pre-entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto* (ICL), *anclaje*, *memoria*.  Consistency is maintained throughout.  Some nuance could be added—for instance, clarifying that *ajuste fino* is a specific fine‑tuning process—but overall terminology is appropriate and clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue retains its original intent, but a few cultural adjustments could improve resonance: e.g., ending with \"¡Hasta la próxima!\" instead of the literal \"…y hasta la próxima entrega de ‘Tech Éclair’.\"  Additionally, the inclusion of a meta‑comment about a possible “more natural phrasing” is extraneous for a finished translation.  Aside from these minor issues, the adaptation works well.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All core ideas and dialogue points from the French original are present.  No significant content is omitted, and the translation does not add irrelevant information.  Minor punctuation changes (e.g., placement of commas) are acceptable and do not alter meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is a solid, faithful rendering of the original French text.  It preserves the dialogue structure, conveys technical concepts, and remains largely understandable to a Spanish‑speaking audience.  Some literal phrasing and a few grammatical hiccups slightly reduce readability and fluency, but they do not hinder overall comprehension.  With a few smooth‑out edits—especially around idiomatic expressions and punctuation—the translation would achieve a more natural, polished feel.  Overall, the work demonstrates good command of both source and target languages, with room for minor stylistic refinement to reach top‑tier quality. "
