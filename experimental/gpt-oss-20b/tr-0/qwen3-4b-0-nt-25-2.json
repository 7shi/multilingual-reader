  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely comprehensible, but several structural and grammatical issues hinder smooth reading. Some sentences use literal, awkward phrasing (“se envía una IA completamente nueva a la escuela”) and missing articles or prepositions (“bienvenido en” instead of “bienvenido a”). Repeated use of quotation marks around technical terms is unnecessary and can confuse readers. Despite these quirks, the overall narrative flow is maintained and the key ideas are understandable.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally intelligible but contains numerous natural‑language slips: missing accents, inconsistent punctuation, and literal word‑for‑word carry‑overs (“El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachear”). Some phrases sound stilted or are not idiomatic in Spanish (“¡Hola y bienvenido en…”, “se apoya en fundamentos extremadamente sólidos”). The vocabulary is mostly appropriate, yet the overall sentence rhythm feels uneven, which reduces the fluency for native speakers.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled well. Key terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *afinado*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto* and *anclaje* are used consistently and correctly. There is no mistranslation of crucial concepts. Minor issues include the word “afinado” used as a noun; a more common phrase would be *ajuste fino* or *ajuste*. Overall, terminology is accurate and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The cultural adaptation is adequate but not polished. The opening line uses “bienvenido en” instead of the idiomatic “bienvenido a”. The dialogue style stays close to the original, which suits a podcast format, but some expressions (e.g., “del bachear”) feel literal rather than adapted. The translation preserves the humor and conversational tone, yet it misses opportunities to use more natural Spanish idioms and to adjust references to Spanish-speaking listeners’ expectations.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French script is present. No major content is omitted, and the translation covers every line of dialogue. Minor omissions are limited to small typographical errors (e.g., “Las nuevas conocimientos” should be “Los nuevos conocimientos”). The structure remains concise and avoids unnecessary repetition, so the content is complete and coherent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation faithfully conveys the main ideas and technical concepts of the original French dialogue, with consistent terminology and an overall clear structure. However, several grammatical and stylistic errors reduce readability and fluency. The translator should focus on correcting prepositions, punctuation, and idiomatic phrasing to improve naturalness. With these adjustments, the translation would reach a high level of quality suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience of a tech podcast. Overall, it is a solid effort but still requires refinement to meet native‑speaker expectations fully.  Score: 15/20."
