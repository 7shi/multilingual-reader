    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow, with clear sentence structure and straightforward explanations of complex concepts. However, a few awkward phrasings (e.g., the use of *chivato* and the quotation marks around certain terms) slightly hinder comprehension. Overall, readers can grasp the content without much effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for native Spanish speakers, and most grammatical constructions are correct. Minor issues include the occasional use of English acronyms without a Spanish equivalent, and the word *chivato*, which may feel informal or ambiguous to some listeners. Nonetheless, the flow remains natural.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto* (ICL) and *anclaje* are appropriate and consistently used. The inclusion of the original English terms in parentheses is helpful for bilingual audiences. No significant mistranslations were found.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation is mostly faithful to the original intent, though the podcast name changes inconsistently from *Tech Éclair* to *Tecno Relámpago* midway, which could confuse listeners. Cultural references remain appropriate, but the title inconsistency is a small contextual flaw.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines and key explanations are preserved. No substantive information is omitted, and redundant content is avoided. The translation remains concise and clear, with the only additions being parenthetical translations of English terms, which aid comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is high‑quality overall, faithfully conveying the original dialogue while maintaining clarity and naturalness. Minor inconsistencies—particularly the podcast title and the informal use of *chivato*—slightly detract from the polish, but these do not significantly affect comprehension or technical accuracy.
