  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to read and the ideas flow logically. However, some sentences are slightly repetitive or contain minor grammatical slips (e.g., future tense in “aprenderá” instead of present), which slightly hinder smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most parts, with appropriate colloquial tone and idiomatic expressions. Minor awkwardness appears in the mis‑labelled ICL section and in the sentence about future tense. Overall, the text reads well but could be polished further.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, and *anclaje* are correctly rendered and consistent. The main issue is the incorrect expansion of ICL as *Lenguaje de Comprensión e Generación*, which misrepresents the original abbreviation. Despite this, technical terminology is largely appropriate.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the conversational tone and informal register suitable for a podcast audience. Cultural references are handled appropriately, and Spanish idioms are used where appropriate. Minor errors in tense and phrasing slightly reduce the adaptation quality.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are included: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory features, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. No substantive content is omitted; some sentences are slightly redundant but remain clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful and understandable, capturing the main ideas and conversational style of the original French podcast. However, a few inaccuracies—especially the mis‑translation of the ICL abbreviation and some tense errors—reduce its overall polish. With minor corrections, it would be an excellent rendition for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
