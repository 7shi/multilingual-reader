  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text follows a fairly simple, conversational style that most native readers can grasp easily. Sentences are short and the overall flow mirrors the original French dialogue. Some parts, however, feel slightly awkward – e.g., *« la IA no se refina constantemente con sus conversaciones »* (the verb *refinar* is not the usual choice for training) and *« Se tiene la impresión de que realmente comienzan a recordar las cosas de una sesión a otra »* (the wording is a bit clunky). Overall, the content is understandable but could benefit from smoother phrasing.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds largely natural to a Spanish speaker, with correct use of gender, articles, and verb tenses. Nevertheless, a few expressions are not idiomatic: *« la IA no se refina constantemente… »* and *« en segundo plano »* are technically correct but feel slightly mechanical. Replacing *refinar* with *entrenar* and perhaps *en el trasfondo* would improve flow. The vocabulary is contemporary and appropriate, but overall fluency is slightly compromised by these quirks.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: *preentrenamiento*, *afinado*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto* (ICL), *anclaje* and *memoria* are all correct and consistent. The abbreviation *ICL* is kept intact, preserving the original meaning. No terms are missing or mistranslated, and the level of explanation matches the intended audience. Consistency and appropriateness are high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator has generally preserved the original intent, but a few cultural nuances could be refined. Spanish speakers might expect expressions like *« entrenar continuamente con las conversaciones »* instead of *« refinar continuamente »* and *« en el trasfondo »* instead of *« en segundo plano »*. Also, certain idiomatic phrasings such as *« Se tiene la impresión de que … »* feel slightly literal. However, the adaptation is largely effective and does not distort meaning.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. The structure of the dialogue is preserved, and no essential details are omitted. Minor redundancies were avoided, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is generally faithful and comprehensible, with solid handling of technical terminology and overall completeness. Minor fluency and contextual adaptation issues slightly reduce its naturalness. With a few stylistic adjustments, it would achieve a high level of polish suitable for a native Spanish‑speaking audience."
