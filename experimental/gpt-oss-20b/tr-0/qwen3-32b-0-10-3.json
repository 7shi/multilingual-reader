  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to read and follows a logical flow. Minor punctuation errors (missing accents on “¿Porque?” and an incomplete phrase “las leyes de la …”) slightly disrupt the reader’s experience, but overall the narrative remains comprehensible.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural for native Spanish speakers. Some constructions feel slightly awkward, e.g., “le presentar” instead of “presentarle”, and the missing accent marks affect smoothness. Nonetheless, the tone is conversational and appropriate for a podcast script.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly translated and consistently used: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, grounding (anclaje), memoria. The terminology is clear for a general audience and matches the original.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The script keeps the original intent and style. Cultural adaptation is adequate for Spanish listeners, but some expressions could be more idiomatic (e.g., “le presentar” → “presentarle”). The context is preserved without unnecessary localization.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The bulk of the content is retained. However, an incomplete sentence (“No necesitas que alguien te recuerde las leyes de la …”) and the missing accent marks constitute small omissions. No major ideas are lost.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and faithfully conveys the original meaning. It would benefit from a final copy‑editing pass to correct a few typographical errors and to polish some slightly awkward phrasing. Overall, it is a competent, listener‑friendly script suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience watching or listening to the podcast. The few minor issues do not impede understanding, but addressing them would elevate the polish and professionalism of the final product. The translation effectively balances accuracy, readability, and cultural relevance, making it well‑suited for its intended purpose while remaining accessible to a broad audience. Minor editorial improvements would push it to an excellent level of quality.  Overall quality score: 17/20 (average of the five criteria)."
