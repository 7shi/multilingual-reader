    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but several literal phrasings (e.g., \"en « Tech Éclair »\", \"Imagínese que se envía una IA completamente nueva a la escuela\") make sentences feel clunky. The overall logical flow is maintained, but a few awkward constructions require reader effort to parse. Score: 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are multiple unnatural expressions: \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bacho\" (mis‑translation), \"se envía una IA\" instead of \"imaginen que se envía una IA\", and occasional use of English terms like \"finetune\" that break the flow. Vocabulary choice is mostly fine, but the overall sentence rhythm is disrupted in places. Score: 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\" (translated as \"afinamiento\"), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", and \"grounding\" (as \"anclaje\") are largely correct. However, consistency suffers: some sections revert to the English word \"finetune\" and the explanation of ICL (“el aprendizaje en contexto, es del bacho”) is confusing. Score: 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original meaning but does not fully adapt to Spanish‑speaking podcast conventions. For example, the greeting should read \"Hola y bienvenidos al podcast Tech Éclair\" instead of the literal French‑style phrase. Cultural references (e.g., the consultant analogy) work but could be smoother. Score: 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the original are present. No essential content is omitted, and the dialogue structure is maintained. Minor redundancy appears but does not obscure meaning. Score: 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the gist of the French podcast but requires polishing for naturalness, consistency, and cultural adaptation. Fixing awkward phrasing, standardizing terminology, and improving greeting conventions would raise the quality to a professional standard. The current version is serviceable but needs revision before publication."
