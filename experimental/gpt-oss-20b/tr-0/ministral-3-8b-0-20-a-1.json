  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally easy to follow. Sentence structures are simple and coherent, and the dialogue format preserves the original flow. However, some short sentences such as \"Cuando abres una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío\" feel slightly awkward because the verb form \"partes\" is ambiguous. Minor adjustments could improve clarity, but overall readers can grasp the concepts without confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most expressions sound natural for native Spanish speakers. The translation avoids overly literal phrasing in key parts (e.g., \"Ventana de contexto\" instead of a literal word-for-word translation). Some terms like \"en el prompt\" and the repeated phrase \"Lo olvida todo\" could be refined for smoother flow, yet they are not dissonant. Overall, the text reads smoothly with only a few minor awkward spots.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled consistently: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"In-Context Learning (ICL)\", \"anclaje\". The translation includes explanatory context for non‑expert readers, maintaining clarity. The only minor issue is the use of \"prompt\" in Spanish, which is acceptable but could be replaced by \"entrada\" or \"mensaje\" for greater naturalness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation respects the original intent and cultural context. Phrases such as \"contratar a un consultor brillante\" and the metaphorical explanations are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The translation preserves the informal yet explanatory tone of the podcast. Some expressions could be fine‑tuned for local idioms, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All core information from the source text is retained. No critical details were omitted, and the translation maintains the dialogue structure and quotation marks. Redundancies are minimal, and the text remains concise. A few repeated phrases are intentional for emphasis in the original, so no unnecessary information was added.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a strong grasp of the source material and effectively communicates complex concepts in Spanish. Minor stylistic refinements would elevate the text to a flawless level, but as it stands, it is clear, fluent, and technically accurate, making it suitable for the intended audience of a tech‑focused podcast listeners who may not be highly specialized but need clear explanations of AI concepts. The overall quality is excellent, with a total score of 90 out of 100 points. The translation successfully balances fidelity, readability, and naturalness for Spanish‑speaking listeners. 90/100."
