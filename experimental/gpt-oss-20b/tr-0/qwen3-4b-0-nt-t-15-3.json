    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the concepts are explained in a straightforward manner. Sentence structures are mostly correct, though a few awkward phrasing and a typo in “conocencias” slightly reduce clarity. Overall, readers can understand the material without confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly natural but contains a few unnatural or slightly formal insertions, such as the comma after “El aprendizaje en contexto,” and inconsistent use of formal versus informal pronouns. Minor grammatical mistakes (“se apoya en fundamentos extremadamente sólidos” is fine, but “El aprendizaje en contexto, es del tipo de bachotage” should be without the comma). These affect the smoothness for native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, memoria) are correctly translated and largely consistent. However, there are small errors: “conocencias” instead of “conocimientos”, “bachotage” instead of “bachotaje”, and occasional lack of emphasis on the meaning of terms when they first appear. Overall the terminology is appropriate but not perfect.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator keeps the original meaning and structure, but some expressions could be more idiomatic in Spanish (e.g., “¡Hola y bienvenido en ‘Tech Éclair’” should be “a” rather than “en”). The dialogue tone is preserved and cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is adequate, though a few phrasing choices feel slightly out of place for a Spanish audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue turns from the French original are present, and no substantive content is omitted. The translation retains the same level of detail and nuance. No unnecessary repetition is introduced, and the passage remains concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is functional and conveys the technical concepts accurately for a Spanish-speaking audience. Minor linguistic errors and occasional awkward phrasing slightly reduce readability and fluency. Overall, it is a competent translation that could benefit from a final polish to eliminate typographical mistakes and improve naturalness of expression."
