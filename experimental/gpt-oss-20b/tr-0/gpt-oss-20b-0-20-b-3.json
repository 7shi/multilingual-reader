  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured, and the narrative flow mirrors the original. Minor issues such as “una hoja de trucos” and some short fragments slightly reduce clarity, but overall readers can understand the concepts without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for native Spanish speakers. Most expressions are natural, though a few are slightly awkward – e.g., “¿Entonces es una astucia?” and the occasional missing accent on “aprendizaje”. The overall tone is conversational, matching the podcast style.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *memoria a corto plazo*, *anclaje*. The acronym ICL is kept in English, which is acceptable, and there is consistency throughout the text. No major mistranslations or omissions of key terminology.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapted cultural references appropriately, keeping the casual, explanatory style. Minor phrases like “una hoja de trucos” could be refined, but overall the intent and tone for a Spanish‑speaking audience are maintained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French transcript are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory mechanisms, and the consultant vs. permanent expert analogy. No substantive content was omitted, and the translation remains concise without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality. It successfully conveys the original meaning, maintains a natural Spanish tone, and uses appropriate technical terminology. Minor stylistic tweaks would further polish the text, but it is ready for publication to a Spanish‑speaking audience."
