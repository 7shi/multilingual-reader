    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely easy to read. The sentences follow a clear structure and the main ideas are conveyed. However, minor punctuation errors (missing space after punctuation, missing accent in “¿Por qué”) slightly hinder readability. Overall, it scores 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural, but a few expressions feel slightly awkward (e.g., repeated use of “aprenderá el francés a una velocidad increíble”). The lack of an accent in “¿Por qué” and the missing space after punctuation make the text feel less polished. The vocabulary is appropriate, but the flow could be smoother. Score: 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinación\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"ICL\" are used correctly and consistently. Explanations for the terms are adequate, matching the audience’s understanding level. No major terminology errors are present. Score: 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone suitable for a podcast audience. Some cultural nuances (e.g., using “consultor brillante” instead of a more specific phrase) are handled well, though a few idiomatic expressions could be slightly refined. Score: 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French text are present in the Spanish version. No essential information is omitted, and the content remains concise. Minor stylistic repetitions are the only issue. Score: 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and conveys the technical concepts clearly. Minor punctuation and stylistic issues slightly detract from readability and fluency, but overall the content is accurate and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Improvements in punctuation, accent usage, and smoothing repetitive phrasing would raise the quality further. The translation meets most of the evaluation criteria well, with scores averaging 16.8/20 across the six categories. The translator demonstrates a good grasp of terminology and contextual adaptation, while some fluency tweaks could enhance the final polish."
