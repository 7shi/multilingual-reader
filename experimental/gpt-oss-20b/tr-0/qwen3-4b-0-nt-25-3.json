    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and keeps the same conversational flow as the French original.  The use of simple sentence structures and clear explanations of concepts like pre‑training and fine‑tuning helps comprehension.  However, some grammatical slips (e.g. *“Hola y bienvenido en”* instead of *«a»*, *“rep aprender”*, *“Apena”*) create brief moments of confusion and interrupt the smooth reading.  These errors lower the score slightly but do not render the text incomprehensible.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The overall tone is informal and matches a podcast transcript, but a number of unnatural expressions detract from the naturalness.  Mistakes such as *“Usted ha entendido todo”* (formal register) and *“Mir”* (missing *e*) make the text feel slightly stilted.  Vocabulary is largely appropriate, yet the occasional typo or mis‑chosen preposition gives it a rough edge.  Consequently the fluency score is modestly reduced.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprender en contexto* (ICL).  Consistency is maintained throughout, and the translation keeps the same terminology as the original.  A small issue is the untranslated word *antisèche*, which could be rendered as *hoja de trucos* or *cheat sheet*.  Overall the terminology is appropriate and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the speaker‑to‑speaker dynamic and cultural context of a podcast.  Some cultural adaptations are missing: the phrase *“Hola y bienvenido en”* should be *«a»*, and the formal *“Usted ha entendido todo”* clashes with the informal register used elsewhere.  Nevertheless, the essential intent and tone of the original are conveyed, so the score reflects a fairly good but not perfect adaptation.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French version are present: the explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the memory feature.  No substantive content is omitted.  Minor omissions include the untranslated *antisèche*, but this does not substantially affect overall understanding.  The translation also avoids redundancy and stays concise.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation faithfully captures the key ideas and conversational style of the original French script.  It is largely intelligible and keeps the technical terminology consistent.  However, a handful of grammatical errors, slightly awkward phrasing, and a few untranslated terms slightly diminish the polish.  With minor corrections—particularly in prepositions, pronoun register, and word choice—the translation would reach a higher level of fluency and naturalness while maintaining its strong content fidelity.\n\nOverall score: 17/20 (sum of individual scores)."
