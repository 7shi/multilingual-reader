  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to read. Sentence structures are logical and the flow mirrors the original dialogue. Minor hiccups appear in capitalization (e.g., “Preentrenamiento” vs. lowercase “preentrenamiento”) but these do not impede understanding. The explanation of concepts is clear and the dialogue remains conversational.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds quite natural for Spanish speakers. Some phrasing feels slightly literal, such as “la IA no está constantemente afinada por sus conversaciones” which could be smoother. There are a few grammatical quirks (e.g., inconsistent capitalization of section titles) but overall the prose is fluid and appropriate for a podcast script.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", and \"Memoria\" are all correct and consistently used. The translation also avoids jargon where unnecessary, making it accessible. Minor inconsistency in title capitalization of \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\" vs. \"aprendizaje en contexto\" exists, but terminology remains accurate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and maintains a conversational, podcast‑style tone suitable for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Cultural references are minimal, but the dialogue remains engaging. There is no loss of nuance or humor, and the adaptation is appropriate for the target readers.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French source is present; no important content is omitted. The translation includes the same examples and explanations (e.g., English/ French language transfer, context window). The added “por lo tanto” transitions are faithful and keep the dialogue concise without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, effectively conveying the original French dialogue while maintaining clarity, naturalness, and accurate terminology. Minor adjustments—particularly in capitalization and a few more idiomatic phrasings—could elevate the text to a perfect score, but as it stands it delivers a clear, engaging, and faithful rendition suitable for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience. Overall score: 18/20. Good job! ✅"
