  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely clear and easy to follow. Sentence structures are mostly logical, and the narrator’s dialogue is presented in a straightforward manner. Minor issues arise from occasional missing articles and slightly clunky phrasing (“para el próximo episodio” could be “para el próximo episodio”) that may momentarily disrupt the flow. Overall, readers can comprehend the content without significant effort.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text generally reads smoothly, but there are a few unnatural expressions and grammatical slip‑ups: \"la IA no se refina constantemente con tus conversaciones\" feels awkward, and the repeated exclamation marks can seem informal. Vocabulary choice is mostly contemporary, though some idiomatic alternatives could improve naturalness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento,\" \"ajuste fino,\" \"aprendizaje por transferencia,\" \"ventana de contexto,\" and \"ICL\" are correctly rendered and consistent throughout. The translation also includes brief explanations where helpful. Overall terminology is appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience familiar with AI concepts.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original tone and cultural references. Using the term \"podcast\" is acceptable in Spanish, and the adaptation to Spanish-speaking listeners is handled well. Minor stylistic adjustments could further localize certain expressions, but the intent and purpose are fully preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant information is omitted; the translation faithfully follows the French source. The content remains concise and clear, and redundancies are avoided. The only small omission is a missing article that does not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and largely faithful to the original French text. It maintains readability and correct terminology while conveying the intended meaning. However, a few grammatical refinements and more natural phrasing would elevate the overall quality to a near‑perfect level. Minor errors such as article omissions and slightly awkward expressions detract slightly from an otherwise smooth and accurate translation. With these small adjustments, the translation would achieve an excellent score across all criteria and offer a highly accessible, natural listening experience for Spanish‑speaking audiences.\n\nAverage score: 18.4/20 (rounded to one decimal)."
