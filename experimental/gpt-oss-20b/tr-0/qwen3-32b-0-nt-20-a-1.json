  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is mostly easy to understand. Sentences are logically ordered and the conversational tone matches the source. Minor issues – such as “Imaginen que enviamos una IA… ” sounding slightly formal and the occasional long sentence – do not impede comprehension, hence a high score of 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for most native Spanish speakers. However, there are a few slightly awkward expressions – e.g. “miren: no enseñarían…” and the use of the acronym AEC without explanation. These do not break the flow but slightly reduce naturalness, so 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are preserved correctly (preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto). The use of AEC as an acronym for “Aprendizaje en Contexto” is non‑standard but understandable; consistency is maintained otherwise. Therefore 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., comparing the model to a university graduate). The speaker names and the overall podcast framing are preserved. Slightly informal phrasing (“imaginen” instead of “imagínese”) may not fit a strictly formal script, but it remains culturally suitable. Score 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present; no omitted explanations or important details. Minor repetition of the same phrase (“aprendizaje en contexto”) is inevitable due to the conversational nature, but it does not detract from clarity. Score 19/20.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the Spanish translation is accurate and highly readable. It captures the original intent and technical content well, though a few expressions feel slightly unnatural or over‑formal. Minor improvements to phrasing and the handling of the AEC acronym would bring the text to near‑perfect fluency. The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the subject matter and the target audience’s expectations, making it suitable for publication or broadcast with only light editing."
