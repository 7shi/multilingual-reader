    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and the dialogue structure is preserved. Some sentences are slightly long or have minor punctuation issues, but overall the reader can follow the conversation without confusion.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally, but there are a few awkward phrasings and inconsistent use of punctuation, especially with question marks and capitalization. Certain expressions could be more idiomatic (e.g., \"es apuntar a la víspera\" instead of \"es apuntar a la víspera\"). Overall, the flow is acceptable but not fully native‑like.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly translated correctly (“preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “anclaje”, “memoria”). The word \"prompt\" is left in English, which is common but could be translated for consistency. Terminology is consistent across the text.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the conversational tone and adapts cultural references appropriately. Repetitive use of \"por lo tanto\" could be varied, but overall the intent and nuance of the original French are preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No major omissions are present; all dialogue lines and explanations are included. The content remains concise, and redundancy is avoided, though a few small edits could tighten the text.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and largely faithful to the source. It maintains the dialogue structure and conveys the technical concepts accurately. Minor fluency issues and a few terminology choices (e.g., retaining \"prompt\") slightly detract from a fully native feel, but overall the translation is clear and suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners."
