  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish transcript is easy to read for a native audience. The sentence structure follows a clear, conversational flow, mirroring the original French dialogue. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are broken down into everyday language (e.g., “un recién graduado”, “un consultor brillante”), making them accessible. The only slight issue is the occasional over‑literal translation of idioms, but this does not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text largely sounds natural and smooth. The translator uses appropriate verb forms and connectors. Some phrases feel slightly awkward, e.g., “Lo has entendido todo” or “bachotaje” (rare in modern Spanish). There are minor punctuation inconsistencies (“preentrenamiento” without hyphen). Overall, the fluency is strong, though not perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “anclaje” and “memoria” are all appropriate and consistent. When a term might be unfamiliar, it is adequately explained (e.g., the comparison to a university graduate). No significant mistranslations or missing terms.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original intent and tone. Cultural references are adapted appropriately; Spanish equivalents for “consultant” and “expert” are used, and explanations fit a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor cultural mismatches are present in the phrase “bachotaje”, which is less common in contemporary Spanish, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present. No omissions were detected, and the translation includes all clarifications and examples that aid understanding. The dialogue remains concise without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is well‑executed, faithfully conveying the original content while maintaining readability and a natural tone. Minor fluency issues and a few less‑common word choices slightly lower the overall quality, but the text remains clear, technically accurate, and culturally adapted. It would be suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience and effectively serves its purpose as a podcast transcript."
