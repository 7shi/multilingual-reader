  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation uses clear, simple sentences that most Spanish‑speaking listeners can follow. The explanations of concepts like pre‑training and in‑context learning are understandable. Some long sentences could be broken up, but overall the text is readable.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text largely flows naturally, but a few expressions feel slightly awkward for native Spanish speakers. Phrases such as \"Lo habéis entendido todo\" and \"para que sea una especialista\" are not idiomatic. Word choice and grammar are mostly correct, but a few minor tweaks would improve smoothness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, memoria a corto plazo. The translation follows common Spanish NLP terminology and keeps the original meanings intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the cultural context of Spanish speakers and adapts idioms appropriately. The dialogue feels natural, though some colloquial expressions (e.g., \"Lo habéis entendido todo\") could be refined. Overall, the intent and tone of the original are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French text is present. No significant omissions were detected, and the translation stays concise while conveying the same details. Minor nuances, like the exact phrasing of \"IA no se afina constantemente\", are kept.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and understandable, with accurate terminology and faithful conveyance of the original content. Minor fluency issues slightly detract from naturalness, but the overall quality remains high. It would benefit from small stylistic edits to improve readability and naturalness in Spanish. The overall score reflects strong performance across all criteria, with room for minor polish in fluency and phrasing nuances. The translation is well‑suited for a Spanish‑speaking audience who are familiar with AI concepts but not experts in the field. Overall, a commendable job that effectively communicates the original ideas while maintaining clarity and coherence in Spanish. The translation is ready for a general audience, with only minor adjustments needed to reach the highest level of naturalness."
