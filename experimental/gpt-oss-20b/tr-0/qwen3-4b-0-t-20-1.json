  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally understandable, but several sentences feel awkward or grammatically incorrect, which can hinder smooth reading. Simple, direct sentences are clear, yet some phrasing (e.g., “una antiesencia”) is confusing. Overall, the script’s basic flow remains, but the readability is somewhat impaired by these linguistic hiccups.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the translation employs many appropriate Spanish words, the naturalness is disrupted by literal renderings (“preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”), missing articles, incorrect verb conjugations, and odd phrases such as “una antiesencia”. These errors make the text feel choppy and less native-like, affecting overall fluency.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly translated – “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto” – and are consistent throughout. However, the incorrect use of “antiesencia” (likely a mistranslation of “pista” or “memoria”) and the vague phrasing in a few places detract from precision. Nonetheless, the terminology is largely appropriate for a general Spanish-speaking audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone, but some expressions could be better localized (e.g., “Hola y bienvenido a” instead of “en”). Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is mostly fine, yet the literal phrasing and occasional awkward syntax limit the effectiveness of the adaptation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French script are present in the Spanish version. No essential content is omitted. Minor redundancies are present but do not significantly affect clarity. The translation maintains the structure of the dialogue and covers all topics discussed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material and retains most of the content, but it falls short in fluency and some terminology accuracy. The script is readable but contains several awkward or incorrect phrases that reduce naturalness. A revision focusing on smoother phrasing, grammatical corrections, and careful handling of technical terms would elevate the quality considerably. Overall, it is a good draft that requires polishing before publication or use in a professional podcast setting."
