  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured, and the dialogue format is preserved. Complex ideas such as pre‑training and fine‑tuning are explained in a straightforward manner that matches the original French. Minor repetitions (e.g., \"La IA no se afina constantemente con tus conversaciones\") do not impede understanding, and the overall flow is logical.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker. Most phrases are natural and the vocabulary is appropriate. A few spots could be polished for idiomatic precision (e.g., \"Se puede decir eso\" could be \"Se podría decir eso\"), but these do not detract significantly from fluency. The use of the acronym ICL is correctly rendered, though a brief explanation of the abbreviation might improve readability.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"In‑Context Learning\" (ICL), \"anclaje\", and \"memoria a corto plazo\" are all accurate. The translation maintains the nuance of the original terms and avoids inappropriate literalism. The only slight issue is the use of \"Afinamiento\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\", but it remains understandable within the context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects cultural and linguistic conventions of Spanish. Pronouns and verb forms are appropriate, and the casual conversational tone of the original is preserved. No cultural references require adaptation, and the overall intent of the dialogue is effectively conveyed. The adaptation is therefore sound.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the explanations for each concept are maintained. Redundancies are minimal and do not compromise conciseness. The translation remains faithful to the original information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, successfully preserving the original meaning, tone, and technical accuracy. Minor stylistic refinements could enhance naturalness, but overall it meets the expectations for a clear, fluent, and contextually appropriate Spanish rendering of the French source text. The score reflects strong performance across all evaluation criteria, with only small opportunities for improvement in phrasing and idiomatic polish. Overall rating: 18.5/20 (rounded to 18/20)."
