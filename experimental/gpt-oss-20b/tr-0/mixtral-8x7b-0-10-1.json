  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow and the sentence structure remains logical. Complex concepts are translated into clear sentences, and the conversational tone is preserved. Minor long sentences could be split for extra clarity, but overall the text is highly comprehensible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native speaker. Word choice and syntax are mostly appropriate, with only a few slightly awkward turns (e.g., \"Justo lo que mencionaba\" and the use of question marks for expository statements). Overall fluency is good, with only minor stylistic adjustments needed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "All key technical terms are rendered accurately and consistently: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje de transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\". No major terminological errors appear, and explanations are provided where necessary.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the informal, friendly vibe of the original podcast. Cultural references are adapted appropriately, and the overall intent and purpose are clearly conveyed. Minor local idiomatic choices could be refined, but the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No essential information from the original French script is omitted. The Spanish text mirrors the structure and content closely, with no significant gaps or unnecessary repetition. The translation remains concise yet thorough.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully preserving the meaning, tone, and technical accuracy of the original French script. While there are a few minor fluency quirks, the overall readability and contextual adaptation make it a strong rendition suitable for native Spanish-speaking audiences."
