    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to read and follows a logical flow. The structure of sentences mirrors the French original, making the content accessible to a general audience. Some small wording choices (e.g., *tus antiguos intercambios* instead of *tus conversaciones previas*) add minor redundancy, but overall the reader can follow the discussion without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for native Spanish speakers. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. There are a few minor stylistic slips: the pronoun mismatch in *‘si abrimos una nueva ventana’* should be *‘si abres una nueva ventana’* and the phrase *‘Cuando comienzas con una nueva conversación’* could be more idiomatic as *‘Al iniciar una nueva conversación’*. These do not severely impede comprehension, but they slightly lower fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: *pre-entrenamiento*, *ajuste*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL*. The translations are consistent throughout the text. The only minor oversight is the use of *'ajuste'* for *fine‑tuning*, which is widely accepted in Spanish technical discourse, but some might prefer *‘ajuste fino’* for clarity.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation appropriately localizes greetings and cultural references (e.g., *Hola* instead of *Bonjour*). It retains the original intent and tone, making it relatable to Spanish‑speaking listeners. The use of *'consultor brillante'* instead of *'consultant'*, and *'expert permanente'* captures the nuance well. Minor cultural tweaks (e.g., *‘apropiándose del contexto pasado’* rather than a literal phrase) further enhance adaptation.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are present. No critical omissions occur, and the translation retains the same level of detail. The only subtle omission is the absence of the brief line *'Le pré‑entraînement.'* in the Spanish text, but the corresponding *'El pre‑entrenamiento.'* fills the gap. Redundancy is minimal, and the overall content remains concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation of the French podcast script is largely faithful and well‑structured. It preserves the original meaning, uses correct terminology, and remains accessible to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic and pronoun inconsistencies slightly detract from perfect fluency, but they do not impede understanding. Overall, the translation demonstrates solid proficiency and is suitable for use in a professional podcast setting. If the target audience is highly technical, a few more domain‑specific terms could be added, but for a general listener base, the current version is more than adequate.  Overall score: 90/100 (average 18/20)."
