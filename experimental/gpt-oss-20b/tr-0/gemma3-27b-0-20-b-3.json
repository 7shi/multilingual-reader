  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated dialogue is easy to follow and most sentences are logically structured. The concepts are explained clearly, and the conversational flow remains intact. A few phrases are slightly repetitive (e.g., “Lo has entendido todo”), but overall the target‑language readers can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Most expressions are smooth, and the grammar is correct. Minor awkwardness occurs in a few lines such as “se le proporcionó una memoria” which could be more idiomatic, but these do not significantly hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning* (fine‑tuning), *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *in‑context learning* (aprender en contexto), *grounding* (anclaje). The chosen vocabulary is appropriate for a general audience and aligns with current usage.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone while adapting idiomatic expressions for Spanish listeners. Cultural references are kept neutral and suitable for a broad Spanish‑speaking audience. The adaptation could slightly improve by avoiding overly literal phrasing in a couple of places, but overall it is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French text are retained. No substantive information is omitted, and the translation does not add extraneous content. The narrative remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, accurately conveying the technical concepts and maintaining the conversational style of the original. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve naturalness, but these do not detract from overall clarity or correctness. The translation meets the standards expected for a professional podcast script intended for a general Spanish‑speaking audience."
