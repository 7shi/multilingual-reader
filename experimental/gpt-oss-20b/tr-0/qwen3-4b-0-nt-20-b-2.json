  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is mostly clear and follows a logical sentence structure. The content is easy to understand for native speakers, and the flow from one idea to the next is preserved. Minor issues arise with occasional literal translations that slightly obscure meaning (e.g., \"cultura general\" instead of \"conocimientos generales\"). Overall, the text is readable with some room for improvement in clarity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several awkward phrasings and non‑idiomatic expressions that disrupt the natural flow. Examples include \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachear\" and \"se tiene la impresión\". The use of capitalized acronyms without explanation (ICL) also feels out of place. Vocabulary choices are mostly correct but not always natural. Consequently, the text sounds a bit stilted to a native reader.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\". The translation of the acronym ICL to \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\" is appropriate. The term \"Memoria\" for the new feature is also correct. Minor consistency issues exist (e.g., capitalizing \"IA\" each time), but overall the terminology is accurate and clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The script’s intent and tone are preserved, but certain idiomatic adaptations could be improved. The Spanish version sometimes reads like a literal translation (e.g., \"bachear\" for cramming), which may not resonate as strongly with Spanish‑speaking audiences. Cultural references are minimal, so the impact is limited, but smoother phrasing would enhance engagement.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant information is omitted. All key points from the original French script are present, including explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning. The structure and content remain faithful, and redundancy is largely avoided. Thus, the translation is complete and concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is comprehensible and largely faithful to the original French text. It successfully conveys the technical concepts and the conversational style of the podcast. However, the fluency suffers from several non‑idiomatic expressions and awkward phrasing, which slightly diminish readability for a native Spanish audience. Refining word choice, improving idiomatic flow, and polishing the overall tone would elevate the translation to a professional level. The technical terminology is well handled, and the content is complete, making this a solid, if slightly imperfect, adaptation suitable for an intermediate‑level Spanish-speaking audience. Overall, the translation demonstrates good understanding of the source material but would benefit from a more natural, culturally tuned rewrite to reach higher quality standards.\n\nOverall Score: 16.2 out of 20 points (rounded to one decimal place)."
