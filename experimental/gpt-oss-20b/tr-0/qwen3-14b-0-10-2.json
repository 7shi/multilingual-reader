  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, but several sentences feel a bit clunky or overly literal, which can momentarily confuse readers. The overall flow is clear and the conversational style is preserved. 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains a number of awkward phrasings, occasional French remnants (“incroyablement”, “ineficace”) and some mismatched gender agreements, which interrupt the natural rhythm of the dialogue. 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"grounding\" are used correctly and consistently. Minor alternatives could be considered, but overall terminology is appropriate. 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator maintained the informal, conversational tone suitable for a podcast and adapted cultural references appropriately. The sense of the original is preserved. 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points and dialogues from the original are present; there are no substantial omissions. Minor redundancies are minimal. 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation faithfully conveys the content and structure of the French original, and it is largely comprehensible to native Spanish speakers. However, a few lingering French words, some awkward phrasing, and slight grammatical slips reduce the overall smoothness. With a quick round of proofreading to clean up these issues, the translation would be of high quality and fully suitable for the target audience."
