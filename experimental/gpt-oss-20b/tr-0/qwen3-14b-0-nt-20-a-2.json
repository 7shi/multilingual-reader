  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is generally easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical order. However, a few phrases are a bit clunky or awkward (e.g., \"enviamos una nueva IA a la escuela\") and could benefit from smoother wording. The overall structure of sentences is clear, so the readability score is solid but not perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural expressions and minor grammatical errors such as incorrect article usage (“una nueva IA” vs “una nueva IA”), missing accents, and slightly awkward phrasing. While the overall flow is understandable, native speakers would notice these issues, lowering the fluency score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely translated correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", and \"anclaje\" are appropriate. The use of \"Mémoire\" as \"Memoria\" is acceptable. Terminology is consistent and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience, justifying a high score.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and cultural tone of the original are preserved. Minor improvements could be made to adapt idiomatic expressions (e.g., replacing literal literalisms with more idiomatic Spanish). Nonetheless, the translation respects the target audience’s cultural background, earning a good score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present; nothing crucial is omitted. Some repetitive phrases could be trimmed for conciseness, but no substantive information is lost, so the completeness score is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and conveys the core ideas accurately. It could be improved by tightening sentence construction, correcting minor grammatical slips, and polishing idiomatic expressions to make it feel more natural to Spanish speakers. With these refinements, it would reach a higher level of fluency and readability while maintaining its technical clarity and completeness. Overall, it is a solid translation that meets most of the evaluation criteria but leaves room for fine‑tuning to achieve near‑native quality."
