  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely understandable, but several errors—such as missing accents, misspelled words, and a few French remnants—make some sentences confusing. Readers can follow the general flow, yet the reading experience is uneven.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains many awkward or incorrect expressions (e.g., \"desempolvar\", \"en rendida posible\", \"l'expansion massive\"). These distort the natural rhythm of Spanish and create a jarring reading experience.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly translated (preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL). However, the inclusion of French fragments and some misspellings compromise consistency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Cultural adaptation is attempted, but several idiomatic choices feel forced or inaccurate, and some original nuances (e.g., use of \"grounding\") are lost or translated literally.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The bulk of the original content is present, though minor omissions and mis‑rendered French passages slightly reduce clarity. No major sections are omitted.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation preserves the core ideas and most technical vocabulary, but a noticeable amount of linguistic and stylistic errors detracts from its readability and naturalness. The result is a passable, yet flawed, Spanish rendering that would benefit from a thorough proof‑read and consistency check."
