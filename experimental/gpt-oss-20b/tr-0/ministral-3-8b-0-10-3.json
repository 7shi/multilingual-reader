  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue is largely understandable to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Sentence structure follows the original fairly well, and explanations of complex ideas such as transfer learning or in‑context learning are clear. Minor issues arise where some phrases feel a bit literal, but overall the flow is logical.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for most parts, but there are a few slightly awkward expressions: \"el modelo en sí no aprende ni evoluciona\" sounds formal, \"lo olvida todo\" is abrupt, and the use of the English word \"prompt\" in italics may feel inconsistent. Despite these small slips, the text feels natural for native Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\" (instead of literal \"afinado\"), \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\". Some terminology choices could be slightly refined (e.g., \"ajuste fino\" rather than \"afinado\"), but overall terminology is accurate and context‑appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original tone and conversational style. Cultural references are neutral and suitable for a Spanish audience. The adaptation maintains the original intent and purpose without unnecessary localization, which is appropriate for an international tech podcast audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory mechanisms, and the concluding remarks. The translation adds no extraneous information and keeps redundancy minimal. Slight repetition of explanations is acceptable in a dialogue format.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the technical content and conversational style of the original French text. Minor refinements in wording and terminology could improve fluency, but the text is clear, accurate, and culturally adapted for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Overall, it achieves a strong translation standard suitable for a professional podcast transcript or script. The score reflects this solid performance while noting small areas for enhancement. 90/100 is an appropriate overall rating, balancing minor linguistic quirks against overall fidelity and readability. 90/100"
