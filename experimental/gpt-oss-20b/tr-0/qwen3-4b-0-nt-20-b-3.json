  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable for a native reader, but several long sentences contain misplaced or missing articles, and some clauses are awkwardly punctuated (e.g., \"para que la IA\" instead of \"para que la IA lo haga\"). The use of informal phrasing in a few places (e.g., \"una ventana de discusión\") slightly disrupts the flow. Overall, it is readable but could be smoother.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds functional, yet several expressions feel mechanical or literal: \"una antiespia\" (should be \"una anota‑cheat\" or \"apuntes\"), \"en el que se transfiere\" (clumsy). There are also small grammatical slips (“la IA no tiene ninguna idea de lo que se dijo antes”). These reduce naturalness, though the vocabulary is largely appropriate.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly correct: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje. Consistency is good, and where needed a brief explanation is given. Minor issues: the phrase \"in-context learning\" is rendered as \"aprendizaje en contexto\" without further clarification. Overall, terminology handling is solid.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Cultural adaptation is adequate; idiomatic expressions such as \"consultor brillante\" or “aprender a pedalear” fit Spanish discourse. However, some metaphors lose nuance (e.g., \"no recuerda lo que se dijo antes\" could be more idiomatic). The translation does not distort the original intent, but a few local expressions could be polished.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French source are present: pretraining, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory features, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. No critical information is omitted, and the added context (explanation of why knowledge is temporary) is consistent with the original. Minor redundancies (e.g., repeated mention of “una antiespia”) are present but do not obscure meaning.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the main ideas accurately and is mostly readable, but it contains several unnatural phrasing and minor grammatical issues that affect fluency. Terminology and information coverage are strong. With minor polishing for naturalness and clarity, the translation would be near‑perfect for a native audience. Overall, it is a competent translation that could benefit from a final review to smooth out awkward turns and improve idiomatic flow. The overall quality is good, but not flawless, reflecting an average score around 15 out of 20 points for this set of criteria. The final score is rounded to the nearest integer: 15/20. This reflects the solid translation quality while acknowledging the areas needing refinement. The detailed reasoning above justifies each individual score.  "
