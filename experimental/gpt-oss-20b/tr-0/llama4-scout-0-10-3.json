  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the dialogue structure and most of the explanations, allowing readers to follow the content. However, several sentences lack proper punctuation and a few phrases are slightly awkward, which can impede quick comprehension. The overall readability is good but could be improved with clearer sentence breaks.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds largely natural for Spanish speakers, but there are inconsistencies in formality (mixing \"tú\" and \"usted\") and a few colloquial or slightly awkward expressions such as \"tienes todo entendido\". Additionally, the absence of commas and other punctuation marks makes the flow less smooth. Overall, the fluency is acceptable but not flawless.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste\" (for fine‑tuning), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\", etc. The translator kept the terminology accurate and easy to understand for a non‑technical audience, with no major mistranslations or omissions.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the target culture and style: greetings are appropriate, idiomatic expressions are used, and the overall intent of the original is preserved. Minor adjustments could enhance naturalness (e.g., using \"¡Hola y bienvenidos!\" instead of \"Hola y bienvenidos\"). The adaptation is solid but could benefit from slight polishing.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French script are present in the Spanish version, including the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, grounding, and memory features. No key information was omitted, and redundant content was avoided. The translation is comprehensive.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful and conveys the technical concepts clearly. Minor improvements are needed in punctuation, consistency of formality, and smoothing of a few phrases to achieve a higher level of fluency and readability. With these adjustments, the translation would be professional and accessible for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
