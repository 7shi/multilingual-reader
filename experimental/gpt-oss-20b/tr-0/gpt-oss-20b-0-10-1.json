  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and easy to follow. Sentences are generally well-structured, and complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in a straightforward way. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., “parte” instead of “partes” when referring to “you” open a new window) slightly interrupt the flow but do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for native speakers. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary. Occasional awkwardness arises from direct literal translations (“Lo has entendido todo.”, “El modelo en sí no aprende”) but overall the prose is smooth and conversational, matching the informal tone of a podcast dialogue.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje (grounding). Terminology is consistent throughout and matches the level of a general audience. Only a minor note: the phrase “ajuste fino” could be clarified as “ajuste fino (fine‑tuning)” for readers unfamiliar with the English term.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational style. Cultural adaptation is adequate, though there is some inconsistency in formality (“usted” vs. “tú”). The Spanish version could slightly better align with Spanish‑speaking media norms (e.g., “lo has entendido todo” → “lo has entendido todo”). Overall, the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the original French transcript is present in the Spanish version. No essential details are omitted, and the dialogue flows logically from one speaker to the next. Minor omissions are nonexistent; the text is fully comprehensive.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, accurately conveying the technical concepts and conversational tone of the original. Minor linguistic refinements and consistency in formality would elevate it to near perfection. It remains clear, fluent, and technically correct for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI and podcast-style explanations."
