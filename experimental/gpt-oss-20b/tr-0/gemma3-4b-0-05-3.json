    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version follows the original structure closely, using clear sentences that a native Spanish speaker can follow. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are introduced with simple explanations. However, some transitions (e.g., “aprende francés a una velocidad increíble” instead of “aprende el francés…”) feel slightly abrupt, which slightly reduces overall readability.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall, the translation reads smoothly and uses appropriate modern vocabulary. Minor awkwardness appears in a few idiomatic expressions (e.g., “Se puede decir eso” instead of a more natural “Se puede decir que es un truco”), and a few punctuation inconsistencies, but these do not significantly disrupt the flow. The text sounds native enough for a general audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved (e.g., “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”) and explained when necessary. Consistency is maintained throughout, and the translation keeps the specialized jargon understandable for a lay audience. Some small lapses in translation of specific phrases (“in‑context learning” as “aprendizaje en Contexto” with mixed capitalization) but overall terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original’s tone and intent, using culturally familiar analogies (consultor brillante, especialista). Some local idioms could be refined (e.g., “aprende el francés a una velocidad increíble” would be more idiomatic). The Spanish version respects the target audience’s cultural background and keeps the conversational feel.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present: explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, anchoring, memory features, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No substantive content was omitted; redundant elements were kept but remain concise. Minor missing accents or quotation style variations do not affect completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality, preserving meaning, tone, and structure. Readability and terminology are excellent, with minor improvements needed in natural phrasing and consistency for perfect fluency. It effectively conveys the technical concepts to a Spanish‑speaking audience."
