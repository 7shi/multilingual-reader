  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely understandable for native readers. The dialogue structure is preserved and complex ideas are explained with sufficient clarity. However, some sentence constructions feel a bit clunky and the flow can occasionally be interrupted by literal phrasing. Minor improvements in phrasing would enhance readability.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most sentences read smoothly, there are several spots where the translation sounds a bit formal or awkward for a casual podcast transcript. For instance, switching between informal 'lo has entendido' and formal 'Usted lo ha entendido' creates inconsistency. Some expressions like 'Se puede decir eso' feel unnatural. Overall, the text is fluent but could benefit from more natural colloquial language.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: 'pre-entrenamiento', 'afinamiento', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto', and 'grounding' as 'anclaje' are appropriate. The acronym ICL is kept, which is acceptable for a bilingual audience. The only minor issue is the use of 'un diplomado' earlier could be replaced with 'un graduado', but this does not significantly affect technical clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the conversational tone and references, but there are a few cultural mismatches: the use of the formal pronoun 'Usted' in a casual setting and the inconsistent register between 'lo has entendido' and 'Usted lo ha entendido'. Additionally, some idiomatic expressions could be adapted more naturally (e.g., 'se puede decir eso' → 'se puede decir que'). These issues slightly reduce the contextual adaptation score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French text are present, including the distinctions between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, and memory features. No essential content is omitted. Minor redundancy exists in the phrasing of some explanations, but the overall information remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and faithful to the source material, successfully conveying the key concepts and dialogue flow. However, it would benefit from a more consistent tone, smoother phrasing, and a tighter adaptation to Spanish podcast conventions. With a few refinements, the translation would read as natural and engaging for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Overall, the translation quality is solid but leaves room for polish in fluency and contextual nuance."
