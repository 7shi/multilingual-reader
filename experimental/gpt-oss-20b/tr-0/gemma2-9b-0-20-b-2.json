    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow; the dialogue flows naturally and the speaker turns are clear. However, a few grammatical slips (e.g., *Esta enfoque* instead of *Este enfoque* and a missing opening question mark in *¿estudiar…*) slightly interrupt the flow, lowering the score from a perfect 20 to 17.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the text reads smoothly for a native speaker, with correct syntax and idiomatic expressions in most places. Some awkwardness remains: the use of *ancrage* instead of *anclaje*, the untranslated term *prompt*, and a few literal translations (*antiguos intercambios*). These minor issues bring the fluency down to 16.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre-entrenamiento*, *fine-tuning*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *in‑contexto learning* are correctly rendered. The occasional use of the French word *ancrage* and the English word *prompt* is inconsistent but still understandable. Consistency could be improved, but overall the terminology is appropriate, giving 18.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation takes care to adapt cultural references (e.g., the analogy of a graduate, the consultant metaphor). The French title *Tech Éclair* is left unchanged in the closing line, which is a small oversight. The adaptation is otherwise good, scoring 17.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant information is omitted. All points from the original dialogue are retained, and the explanation of concepts is clear. Slightly redundant wording in a few places but overall concise and complete, meriting 19.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the essence of the original French dialogue and is largely comprehensible to native speakers. Minor grammatical and lexical inconsistencies—particularly in terminology and the occasional untranslated French word—lower the overall quality, but the message remains clear and the intent is preserved. With a few adjustments to improve consistency and polish, the translation would reach a near‑perfect score."
