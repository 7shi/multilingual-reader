  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to read and follows the original logic. Sentences are short and the narrative flows smoothly. Minor readability issues arise from slightly repetitive phrasing (e.g., “para esa única conversación”) and occasional missing articles, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The diction is contemporary and mostly idiomatic. A few phrases sound slightly literal or awkward, such as “para darle una educación general” instead of “para brindarle una base general,” and “en la misma conversación” where “para esa única conversación” would be smoother. No major grammatical errors are present.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly translated and consistently used: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “anclaje”, “memoria a corto plazo”. Explanations accompany terms when needed. The only minor inconsistency is the use of “grounding” as “anclaje” rather than “fundamentación” or “enraizamiento,” but this is acceptable in context.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the French original to Spanish culture with appropriate salutations (“Hola y bienvenidos”) and retains the original intent. It does not introduce cultural misunderstandings or unnecessary changes. Some expressions could be further localized (e.g., using “consultor experto” instead of “consultor brillante”), but overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are preserved: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, context‑window, ICL, grounding, memory mechanisms, and the consultant analogy. No substantive content is omitted, and the translation does not add extraneous information. Redundancy is minimal.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the original French dialogue while maintaining readability and fluency. Minor linguistic nuances could be refined, but these do not significantly affect comprehension. It is a strong translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
