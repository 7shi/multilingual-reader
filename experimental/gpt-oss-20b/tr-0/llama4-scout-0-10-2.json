  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely understandable and follows a logical sentence structure. The flow is clear, especially for Spanish speakers familiar with informal dialogue. However, some phrases feel slightly formal or stilted (e.g., \"La IA no se ajusta constantemente por tus conversaciones\"). This reduces overall readability by a few points.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text reads smoothly in most places, but there are several instances of awkward wording and minor grammatical slips (e.g., \"se le ha proporcionado una ayuda\", \"por tus conversaciones\"). These do not prevent comprehension but slightly detract from naturalness, so a moderate score is appropriate.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste (fine‑tuning)\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are used correctly and consistently. A few terms could be refined (e.g., using \"ajuste fino\" for fine‑tuning, \"pistas\" instead of \"ayuda\"), but overall terminology is accurate and suitable for a general Spanish-speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue preserves the original’s conversational tone and humor. Cultural references are appropriate for Spanish speakers, and expressions are adapted sensibly (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", \"montar en bicicleta\"). Minor stylistic differences (some slightly formal wording) exist but do not distort intent. Thus, the adaptation is largely effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the translation keeps the same level of detail. The only small loss is in the nuance of a few phrases that could be phrased more naturally, but overall completeness is high.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is a solid, faithful rendering of the original French dialogue. It captures the main ideas, technical terminology, and conversational tone, while maintaining readability for a general audience. Minor linguistic adjustments could improve naturalness and precision, but these do not detract significantly from the overall quality. The translation would be well received by Spanish-speaking listeners of the podcast, with only a few spots needing polish for full native fluency."
