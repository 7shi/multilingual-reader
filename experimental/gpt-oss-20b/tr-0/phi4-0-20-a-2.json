    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated dialogue is largely clear and follows a logical sentence order.  Simple explanations of technical steps are present and the conversational tone is preserved.  Minor punctuation issues (e.g., a comma before “es” in “El aprendizaje en contexto, es …”) slightly interrupt the flow, but overall readers can understand the content without confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences read smoothly and use idiomatic Spanish.  However, a few awkward constructions appear: the retained French word “ancrage”, a slightly unnatural use of “lo” for the indirect object when referring to the AI, and the repetitive phrase “Lo olvida todo.”  Additionally, the insertion of a comma before “es” and the lack of subject‑verb agreement in “El aprendizaje en contexto, es …” detract from native‑speaker fluency.  Despite these, the translation feels mostly natural.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto” and “aprendizaje en contexto” are correctly rendered and consistent.  The single slip – keeping the French “ancrage” instead of the Spanish “anclaje” – indicates a small lapse in terminology consistency.  No major terms are omitted or mistranslated.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue is adapted to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using appropriate cultural references (e.g., “contratar a un brillante consultor”) and maintaining the conversational tone.  The retention of “ancrage” and the occasional literal translation of French idioms slightly weaken cultural adaptation, but overall the intent and humor of the original are effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original—pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, memory mechanisms, and the consultant versus permanent expert analogy—are present.  No significant information is omitted, and redundancy is avoided.  The translation remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version captures the essence and flow of the original French script and conveys all technical and conceptual details.  Minor issues in terminology consistency, punctuation, and a few awkward word choices prevent it from being flawless, but the translation remains readable, fluent, and largely accurate."
