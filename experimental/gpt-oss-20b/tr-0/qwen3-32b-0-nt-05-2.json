    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logically structured and the text uses a conversational tone that matches the original podcast style. Some passages are slightly wordy (e.g., “la IA no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus discusiones”) and could be tightened, but overall the narrative remains comprehensible to a native Spanish speaker. The translation successfully keeps the flow and does not introduce confusing breaks in logic. 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation reads naturally, with appropriate verb tenses and idiomatic expressions such as “se puede tener una conversación larga y detallada” or “cuando abre una nueva ventana”. However, there are a few awkward choices: the acronym “AIC” (Aprendizaje In‑Contexto) is not standard; it should be “ICL” or “aprendizaje en contexto”. Also, phrases like “el modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus discusiones” feel slightly formal for a podcast script. These quirks slightly reduce the fluidity. 17/20.",

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly translated: “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “grounding”→“anclaje”. The only inconsistency is the acronym: the original “ICL” (In‑Context Learning) is rendered as “AIC”, which could confuse readers. Otherwise, terminology remains precise, consistent, and adapted to a general Spanish audience. 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the informal, conversational nature of a podcast. Spanish idioms (“se abre una nueva ventana”, “se podría decirlo”) and culturally familiar expressions are used. The content remains faithful to the original intent and tone. A small point of improvement would be to ensure consistent use of the acronym ICL instead of AIC, but overall the contextual adaptation is strong. 19/20.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present in the Spanish version: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, context window expansion, grounding, difference between temporary knowledge and permanent skill, and the new memory feature. No major omissions or added content appear. The only slight issue is the mislabelled acronym, but this does not alter the conveyed information. 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers a clear, largely natural Spanish rendition of the original French script. It preserves the conversational tone, key technical concepts, and overall intent. Minor refinements are needed, particularly regarding the ICL acronym and some slightly formal phrasing, to improve fluency and consistency. With these adjustments, the text would meet high standards for a Spanish‑speaking audience, offering both readability and technical accuracy."
