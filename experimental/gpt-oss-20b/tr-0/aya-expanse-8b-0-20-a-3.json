  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to read and follows a logical sentence structure. The dialogue flow is maintained, and complex concepts are explained in a straightforward way. Minor readability issues arise from a few missing punctuation marks (e.g., missing closing exclamation marks) and the accidental name change of the podcast, which can momentarily confuse the reader. Overall, the text is comprehensible for a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation feels natural for most parts, with appropriate verb tenses and idiomatic expressions. Some awkwardness is present, such as the repetition of capitalized terms (“Aprendizaje en Contexto” twice) and the incorrect “Tech Luz” name. A few grammatical slips (missing punctuation and a minor tense mismatch) reduce the fluency slightly. The vocabulary remains contemporary and appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “preentrenamiento,” “ajuste fino,” “aprendizaje por transferencia,” “aprendizaje en contexto” and “anclaje” are all correctly translated and consistently used. The term “grounding” is accurately rendered as “anclaje,” and “fine‑tuning” as “ajuste fino.” No major terminology errors are found, though the show name mis‑translation (“Tech Luz” instead of “Tech Éclair”) could be seen as a terminology oversight.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The cultural adaptation is generally sound: idiomatic expressions and colloquial dialogue match a Spanish‑speaking audience. The main contextual issue is the inadvertent renaming of the podcast, which breaks continuity and could be confusing. Aside from that, the tone and style reflect a conversational podcast and adapt the original intent effectively.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French original is preserved: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, context‑based learning, grounding, memory mechanisms, and the concluding question. There is no loss of meaning, and the translation does not add unnecessary content. The only minor omission is the consistent use of the original podcast name. Overall, the content is complete and concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is strong and largely faithful to the source text. It captures the technical concepts, dialogue flow, and overall intent, making it accessible to native Spanish speakers. However, small errors—such as missing punctuation, a mistaken podcast name, and slight repetition—lower the fluency and contextual precision. These issues can be easily corrected without altering the translation’s meaning."
