  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is easy to read for Spanish speakers; sentence structure is mostly clear and follows the dialogue format. Minor issues with comma placement and some repetitive wording slightly hinder flow, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most parts, with appropriate colloquial expressions and contemporary vocabulary. However, a few phrases feel slightly mechanical (“pues en la ventana de contexto”) and some punctuation could be improved, which lowers the fluency marginally.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", and \"ICL\" are correctly rendered. The term \"grounding\" is translated as \"anclaje\", which is acceptable in this context. Terminology is consistent throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal tone and conversational style of the original French. Cultural references are appropriately adapted for Spanish listeners, and the brand name \"Tech Éclair\" is kept. A few expressions could be further localized, but the overall intent is conveyed effectively.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines from the original are present and no significant content has been omitted. The translation does not add unnecessary information and maintains conciseness. Redundancy is minimal, so completeness is high.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful and clear, effectively conveying the technical concepts and conversational tone of the original French script. Minor issues with natural phrasing and punctuation slightly reduce its polish, but overall it meets the expectations for readability, fluency, and accuracy for a native Spanish-speaking audience. Continued attention to subtle idiomatic nuances could raise the quality even further, but as it stands, the translation is competent and well‑executed.  Overall score: 17/20."
