  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely readable and follows a clear sentence structure. The dialogue is easy to follow, and complex ideas such as pre‑training and in‑context learning are explained with simple analogies. Minor issues (e.g., the abrupt “AIC” abbreviation and the slightly choppy transition from “I” to “I”) do not impede comprehension but could be smoothed out. Overall, readers can grasp the content without confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, with appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic expressions. However, there are a few awkward phrasings that could be polished: \"La IA no se afina constantemente con tus conversaciones\" (better: \"La IA no se afinan constantemente con tus conversaciones\"), \"Se puede decir eso\" is correct but feels slightly literal, and the abrupt “AIC” acronym stands out. The dialogue still feels conversational and suitable for native Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and adapted well: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\". Consistency is good, and explanations are provided when needed (e.g., analogies). The only potential slip is the capitalization of \"AIC\" instead of the correct \"ICL\" in one place, but otherwise terminology is appropriate for a general audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the informal tone of a podcast and includes cultural references that resonate with Spanish speakers. The humor and conversational style are maintained. Some expressions could be more localized (e.g., replacing “consultor brillante” with “consultor de primera” or similar), but overall the adaptation effectively conveys the original intent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All segments of the original dialogue are present in the Spanish version, and no critical information was omitted. Minor repetitions were avoided, and the content remains concise. The only slight issue is the unexplained acronym “AIC”, which could confuse readers, but the overall message is intact.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is high quality, faithfully preserving the content, tone, and technical details of the original French script. Minor fluency and consistency issues exist but do not significantly detract from the overall clarity or impact. The translation serves well for a Spanish‑speaking audience and could be polished to a near‑perfect level with a few adjustments to phrasing and acronym usage. Overall, it demonstrates strong readability, good use of terminology, and effective contextual adaptation, making it a reliable and engaging rendition for listeners of the podcast \"Tech Éclair\" in Spanish. Overall score: 84/100 (4.2/5)."
