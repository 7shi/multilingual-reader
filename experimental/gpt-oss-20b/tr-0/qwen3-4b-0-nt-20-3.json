    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to read. Sentences are mostly straightforward and the flow follows the original French dialogue. Some parts—particularly the explanation of in‑context learning—could be split into shorter sentences to aid comprehension for readers less familiar with AI terminology. Overall, readers can understand the gist of the conversation without confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads well for Spanish‑speaking audiences. There are a few minor grammatical slips (e.g., \"aplicación\" should be \"aplicación\" or \"solicitud\" in context) and some slightly awkward phrasings such as \"la ventana de contexto\". Nevertheless, the text sounds natural, uses appropriate contemporary vocabulary, and does not contain any glaring errors that would distract the reader.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key AI terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", and \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are accurately translated and consistently used throughout. The translation includes brief clarifications (e.g., explaining that ICL is a form of \"bachotaje\") that are helpful for a general audience. The terminology is technically correct and well adapted to the target language.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue tone and conversational style are preserved. The translation considers cultural context by using expressions familiar to Spanish speakers (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", \"solicitud\"), and it avoids literal Frenchisms that might feel out of place. The adaptation is effective, though a few colloquialisms could be tweaked for specific Spanish dialects (e.g., Latin‑American vs. Iberian) if a specific audience is targeted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present: the stages of training, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the discussion of memory features. No significant content was omitted, and the translation does not add extraneous material. Minor expansions (explanations of technical terms) enhance understanding without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation faithfully conveys the original French script, maintaining both technical accuracy and conversational flow. While there are a handful of minor grammatical and stylistic tweaks that could improve the polish, the overall quality is high and suitable for a general audience interested in AI technology. The translator demonstrates strong command over terminology, clear explanation of concepts, and thoughtful cultural adaptation."
