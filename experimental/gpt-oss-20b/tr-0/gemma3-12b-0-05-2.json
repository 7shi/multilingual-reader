  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to read and follows a logical structure similar to the original. Sentences are clear and most technical concepts are expressed in straightforward language. Minor issues arise with a few awkward phrasings (e.g., “para un experto permanente?”) but overall the narrative flows well and the target audience can grasp the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly smoothly for a native Spanish speaker. Some expressions feel slightly literal or awkward—\"bacheatear\" is an uncommon verb in this context, and the use of quotation marks around verbs like \"olvidado\" feels a bit forced. Word choice is generally appropriate, but these small quirks reduce the naturalness of the text.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", and \"anclaje\" are correctly rendered. Consistency is maintained throughout. However, the term \"bacheatear\" deviates from standard terminology for memorization, and a few translations could be slightly refined for precision.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the intent and conversational tone of the original French script. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is largely straightforward. The dialogue remains informal and engaging, though some literal phrasing could have been adapted for more natural Spanish colloquialisms.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the original is present, and no significant details are omitted. The translation provides equivalent explanations and maintains the same length, making the narrative concise yet thorough. Minor redundancies exist but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely accurate and readable, successfully conveying the original’s intent and technical explanations. While there are a few stylistic and lexical quirks—particularly the use of \"bacheatear\" and some slightly literal phrasing—the overall quality is high and suitable for a native Spanish-speaking audience. With minor refinements, it could achieve near-perfect fluency and terminology precision."
