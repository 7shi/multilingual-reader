    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the main ideas are clear. However, some sentences contain awkward word order or missing articles (e.g., “las conocimientos” instead of “los conocimientos”), which can momentarily confuse the reader. The overall structure remains logical, so a score of 16/20 is appropriate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly reads smoothly, but there are several minor grammatical slips (e.g., misplaced commas, incorrect verb agreement). Native readers might find a few phrases slightly unnatural, such as “El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje.” The vocabulary is suitable, but a few idiomatic choices could be refined. Thus, a score of 15/20 is justified.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well handled: ‘preentrenamiento’, ‘afinamiento’, ‘aprendizaje por transferencia’, ‘aprendizaje en contexto’, ‘grounding’ (translated as ‘anclaje’). The translation keeps consistency throughout the script and provides clear equivalents. Minor issues include the untranslated ‘fine‑tuning’ in the introductory line, but overall terminology is accurate, meriting 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The cultural and contextual adaptation is good; the translation preserves the conversational tone and the intent of the original French script. Some expressions such as ‘¿Necesito un consultor temporal o un experto permanente?’ fit Spanish conversational norms. Minor linguistic choices could be polished, but the adaptation remains effective. Score: 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No major content is omitted, and the script stays concise. Small punctuation errors do not affect overall completeness. Therefore, 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core ideas of the original French script with reasonable accuracy and fluency. While most technical terms and concepts are correctly rendered, a handful of grammatical and punctuation errors slightly diminish readability and naturalness. With minor revisions, the text would be polished to near‑native quality. Overall, the translation is solid but could benefit from a final proofread to address the identified issues. Overall score: 16/20."
