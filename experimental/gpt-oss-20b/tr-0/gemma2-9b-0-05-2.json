  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version generally follows the sentence structure of the original and most readers can grasp the overall meaning. However, some sections are hard to follow because of incorrect word choices (e.g., \"afianzamiento\" instead of \"afinamiento\") and occasional broken sentences. The concepts are explained clearly enough, but a few paragraphs feel disjointed or too literal, which lowers overall readability.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly understandable, yet it contains several awkward expressions and a noticeable mix of languages (“Es donc”, “ancrage”). Many sentences are too literal, lacking the natural flow typical of spoken Spanish. The use of unfamiliar or incorrectly translated terms disrupts the smoothness, leading to a lower fluency score.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are inconsistently handled. \"Fine‑tuning\" is rendered as \"afianzamiento\", which is not standard in Spanish; the usual term is \"ajuste fino\" or \"fine‑tuning\" in English. \"In‑Context Learning\" is correctly translated to \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\", but other terms such as \"grounding\" are incorrectly rendered as \"ancrage\" (the French word). These inconsistencies affect clarity for a technical audience.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Cultural adaptation is largely adequate: idioms like \"con un proyecto en curso\" and the consultant analogy work for Spanish speakers. Nevertheless, the mix of languages and some literal phrasings reduce the natural feel of the dialogue, slightly weakening contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the bulk of the content and the dialogue flow. No major sections are omitted, and the explanatory parts are retained. Minor omissions include a few subtle nuances in the original, but overall the information is complete and concise.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the main ideas of the French original and is largely readable, but it suffers from noticeable terminology errors and occasional awkward phrasing. These issues lower its fluency and precision. With some revisions to terminology and language polishing, the translation could reach a high standard of quality, but as it stands it is acceptable for informal listening but not for a technical or professional audience that expects precise terms and smooth prose. Overall, the translation is functional but needs refinement to achieve a professional level of polish and accuracy. The average score across criteria is 13/20, reflecting its potential with some corrections needed for consistency and naturalness in Spanish."
