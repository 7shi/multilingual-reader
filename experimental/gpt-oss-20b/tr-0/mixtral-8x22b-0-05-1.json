    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. Sentences are long in places and punctuation could be tightened, but the main ideas are conveyed clearly and the structure mirrors the original dialogue. Minor issues such as missing article before “una IA” or the absence of a comma in a few spots do not hinder comprehension. Overall readability is solid, though not flawless.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker, with idiomatic phrases such as “la IA no está constantemente afinada” and “Lo has entendido todo.” The tone is conversational and appropriate for a podcast script. However, the acronym AIC for In‑Context Learning is incorrect (should be ICL) and a few verb forms are slightly awkward (e.g., “Se le ha proporcionado una hoja de referencia”). These minor issues lower the fluency slightly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly retained: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje. The translation explains “aprendizaje en contexto” as “aprender a repasar para un examen”, which is a helpful paraphrase for lay readers. The mis‑labelled acronym AIC is a notable slip, but otherwise terminology is accurate, contemporary and consistently used throughout the transcript.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and conversational style while adapting to Spanish‑speaking audiences. Cultural references are minimal, but the use of “consultor brillante” and “documentos de información exactos” fit well. Some wording (“Ahí es donde entra”) is slightly informal, but this does not detract from the overall adaptation. The script would feel natural to a Spanish‑speaking listener.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All segments of the original French transcript are present in the Spanish version, including the discussion of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, anchoring, memory features, and the concluding remarks. No substantive information is omitted. Some redundancies (e.g., repeating “la IA no olvida todo”) are kept for emphasis, but overall the content is concise and complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful, clear, and engaging. It preserves the technical content and conversational tone of the original French script while making it accessible to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor corrections—especially regarding the ICL acronym and a few stylistic tweaks—would elevate it to near‑perfect quality. As it stands, the translation serves its purpose well and would be well received by the target audience."
