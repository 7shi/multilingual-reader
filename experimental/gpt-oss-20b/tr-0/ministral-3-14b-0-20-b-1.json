  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely easy to read and the meaning of each sentence is clear.  Most complex ideas are explained in a straightforward way, and the sentence structure is logical.  Minor issues such as the over‑use of *por lo tanto* and the occasional literal “entonces” could be smoothed, but overall the text is highly comprehensible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds mostly natural to a native Spanish speaker, with appropriate vocabulary and contemporary phrasing.  Some expressions feel slightly literal or awkward (e.g., *por lo tanto* repeated, *se vuelve tan inteligentes* instead of *se vuelven tan inteligentes*, and the passive construction in “la IA no está siendo constantemente afinada”).  These do not impede understanding but reduce the flow.  Overall fluency is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *anclaje*, and *memoria* are correctly rendered and consistent throughout.  The translation occasionally uses slightly informal equivalents (*empollarse* for *bachotage*), but this is appropriate for the audience.  No critical term is missing or mistranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally preserves the original intent, but there are a few inconsistencies: the show title is rendered as *Tech Éclair* in most places and *Tecno Relámpago* only in the final line.  Some cultural adaptation is present (e.g., *empollarse* instead of a literal *bachotage*), but the mixing of titles could confuse listeners.  The rest of the adaptation is suitable for Spanish‑speaking audiences.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French script is present.  The translator has added useful explanations for terms (e.g., describing *aprendizaje por transferencia* with an analogy), and no key points are omitted.  Redundancy is minimal, and the content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality.  It preserves the meaning, uses appropriate technical terminology, and is largely fluent and readable.  Minor stylistic issues and a small inconsistency with the show title reduce the score slightly.  Overall, the translation effectively conveys the original content to a Spanish‑speaking audience and would be suitable for publication with minor polishing."
