  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentence structures are logical and the dialogue format is preserved. However, a few minor grammatical slips (e.g., “partes de un contexto vacío”) slightly reduce the smoothness of the narrative, which keeps the score from a perfect 20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a Spanish speaker, using contemporary vocabulary and appropriate idiomatic expressions. Some phrasing is slightly literal or awkward, such as “La IA no está constantemente afinada por sus conversaciones” and “partes de un contexto vacío”. These do not impede understanding but prevent a flawless native feel, thus a 17‑18 rating.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\", \"anclaje\". The Spanish equivalents match the original concepts and are appropriate for the target audience. Minor omissions like the ICL acronym are inconsequential, leading to a high score of 19.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue preserves the original tone and humor while adapting cultural references for a Spanish audience. The translation stays true to the intent of the French text and avoids unnecessary localisation, which merits a strong 18.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No critical content was omitted, and the translation includes the same explanations and examples. A few very small details (e.g., the ICL acronym) are missing but do not materially affect comprehension, so the score is 18.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation faithfully conveys the content and intent of the original French text, with only minor linguistic refinements needed. It demonstrates solid command of technical terminology, good readability, and appropriate cultural adaptation. Minor fluency issues do not detract significantly from overall quality, making this a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The average score reflects these strengths while accounting for the slight imperfections noted above.  The final average is 18/20.  The translation is therefore of professional standard and ready for publication with only a few minor edits for polish.  Overall score: 18 out of 20.  Score: 18.  "
