  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are mostly short and logical, and the use of everyday connectors (por lo tanto, entonces, así, etc.) helps maintain flow. Some repetition of “por lo tanto” and a few slightly long constructions could be streamlined, but overall readers should grasp the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds largely natural for native Spanish speakers. However, there are a few awkward expressions and inconsistent pronoun usage (“la IA no se afina constantemente con sus conversaciones”) that feel slightly literal. Vocabulary choices are appropriate, though a few phrases could be polished for smoother readability.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding (translated as anclaje). The translation explains the concepts where needed, and maintains consistency throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references are neutral and suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience. Minor adjustments (e.g., replacing “anclaje” with a more common equivalent) could enhance naturalness, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant content has been omitted. All technical explanations and examples are preserved, and redundant sections are kept concise. The translation provides enough detail for a reader unfamiliar with the original context.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "This is a solid Spanish translation that faithfully conveys the technical details and conversational tone of the original French. While a few phrasing tweaks could improve naturalness, the translation is clear, consistent, and complete, making it suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience."
