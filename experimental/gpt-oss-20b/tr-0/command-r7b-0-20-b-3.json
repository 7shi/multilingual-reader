  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated dialogue is easy to follow and the concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained clearly. Sentence structure is generally logical, with short conversational turns that match the original script. Minor issues arise with some literal phrasing (e.g., \"aprenderá francés a una velocidad increíble\" instead of a more idiomatic \"aprende francés rápidamente\"), but these do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward expressions and some literal translations that feel stilted. For example, \"Aprendizaje en Contexto Interno\" is unusual, and \"aprenderá francés a una velocidad increíble\" is slightly redundant. Additionally, the use of \"consultor brillante\" feels informal compared to the original \"consultant brilliant\". Despite these quirks, the overall flow is smooth and would be understood by native speakers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and appropriate for the target audience: pre‑entrenamiento, afinación, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ancoraje (grounding). The consistency of terminology across the transcript is good, and no critical terms are omitted. Some minor deviations (e.g., \"aprender en contexto\" instead of \"aprendizaje en contexto\") do not alter meaning but could be tightened.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects cultural norms: use of greetings like \"¡Hola y bienvenidos!\", informal sign‑off, and Spanish punctuation. The brand name \"Tech Flash\" is an appropriate adaptation of \"Tech Éclair\", though keeping the original could also be justified. Overall, the script remains conversational and appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines from the original are present; no substantive information is omitted. The explanation of key concepts remains intact, and the flow of the conversation is preserved. The translation could benefit from minor cleanup (e.g., removing a duplicated phrase \"Apoyo en contexto\"), but no critical information is lost.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation delivers a clear, largely fluent rendering of the original French podcast. It captures the main ideas and conversational tone, though a few idiomatic refinements and consistency tweaks would enhance naturalness. Overall, it is a competent translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience, with a few areas for polish that would elevate it to near‑native quality. The total score reflects a strong translation that could serve effectively in a broadcast context after minor edits for style and terminology consistency. The final score is 85 out of 100, indicating high quality with some room for improvement in fluency and contextual nuance. Good job overall, keep refining the natural language flow and double‑check terminology consistency for the final version. Good work! 85/100"
