  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to read and the main ideas are conveyed, but a few expressions—such as *crunchar* and the use of parentheses for technical terms—make parts of the dialogue feel slightly awkward or unclear. Short, direct sentences help comprehension, yet some long, compound sentences could be broken up for smoother reading.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the language feels conversational, but there are several instances of unnatural phrasing. The word *crunchar* is not standard Spanish, and phrases like *aprender intensamente* would be clearer. Repetitive use of parentheses and mismatched quotation marks also break the flow. A native speaker would notice these quirks but still understand the message.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved and correctly translated: *pré-entraînement* → *pre-entrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning* → *afinado* (although *ajuste fino* might be clearer), *In‑Context Learning* → *aprendizaje en contexto*, *grounding* → *anclaje*. Minor inconsistencies exist, but the terminology is generally appropriate and understandable for a general tech audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and tone, and the cultural adaptation is largely adequate. However, some phrases (e.g., *crunchar*, *la IA es como un joven graduado de la universidad*) feel slightly literal and could be replaced with more idiomatic Spanish expressions to better fit the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present; no major content is omitted. The dialogue flows logically, and additional clarifications (e.g., explaining *grounding*) are adequately provided. Minor stylistic omissions, such as missing articles or slightly different verb tense choices, do not affect overall understanding.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is fundamentally accurate and captures the structure and meaning of the original dialogue. However, a few non‑native or awkward word choices and formatting issues reduce its fluency. With some polishing—especially replacing *crunchar* with a clearer expression and smoothing long sentences—the translation would achieve a high level of naturalness and readability for Spanish‑speaking listeners."
