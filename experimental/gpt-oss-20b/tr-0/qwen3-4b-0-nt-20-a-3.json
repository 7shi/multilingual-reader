  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly easy to read for Spanish speakers. Sentence structure is logical and most concepts are explained clearly. Minor issues arise from literal phrasing such as “se envía una IA completamente nueva a la escuela” which could be more idiomatic, but overall comprehensibility is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text generally flows smoothly, but several phrases sound slightly unnatural or contain small grammatical errors. Examples include “se le da simplemente la información de la que necesita” (better “se le da simplemente la información que necesita”) and “estas conocimientos” (should be “estos conocimientos”). These issues reduce the naturalness, but the overall style is acceptable for a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: pretraining → preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning → afinamiento, transfer learning → aprendizaje por transferencia, in‑context learning → aprendizaje en contexto, grounding → anclaje. Minor variations like “ajuste fino” could be used, but the chosen terms are appropriate and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references well, using familiar expressions such as “consultor” and keeping the dialogue tone. Some literal constructions (e.g., “ventana de contexto” instead of a more common “ventana de contexto”) are acceptable, though a few phrases could be more idiomatic. Overall, the intended meaning and tone are preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French are present. No substantial information is omitted, and the added clarifications (e.g., explicit mention of “el modelo en sí mismo no aprende”) enhance understanding. Redundancy is minimal, and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful and understandable, with a few minor grammatical and stylistic issues that slightly affect naturalness. Terminology is consistently applied, and the overall intent of the original dialogue is effectively conveyed. With some polishing, it would reach a professional level of translation quality."
