  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely understandable to a Spanish‑speaking audience. The dialogue structure is preserved and the explanations of complex ideas (e.g., pre‑training, fine‑tuning, context window) are clear. Some sentences, however, read a bit clunky (e.g., \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es apretar\"), which slightly hampers flow, but overall comprehension is good.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains a number of unnatural expressions and occasional grammatical slips: \"es apretar\" instead of the intended \"es bachotaje\", duplicated parenthetical explanation of ICL, and a few phrasing choices that feel more literal than idiomatic. These reduce the naturalness of the prose, though the majority of sentences read smoothly.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are largely retained: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\" (fine‑tuning), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and the explanation of ICL. Some minor inconsistencies appear (e.g., alternating between \"afinado\" and \"ajuste fino\"), but overall terminology is accurate and consistent with common Spanish usage in AI contexts.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation respects the original intent and keeps the dialogue style. Cultural references are minimal, but the translation appropriately localizes expressions like \"consultor brillante\" for \"consultant\". Slightly awkward phrasing does not distort meaning, so the contextual adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present in the Spanish version, including the explanation of pre‑training, transfer learning, ICL, memory features, and the consultant vs. permanent expert analogy. No significant content is omitted, and the translation remains concise without unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is generally solid and conveys the technical concepts and dialogue effectively. It benefits from a clear structure and accurate terminology, though it suffers from occasional awkward phrasing and minor grammatical inconsistencies that detract from full fluency. With minor refinements, the translation would reach a high level of naturalness and readability for native Spanish readers familiar with AI terminology. Overall, it is a competent translation suitable for a podcast audience but could be polished further for a professional production level. The overall rating reflects this balance: solid but with room for improvement in fluency and natural expression. Score: 16/20."
