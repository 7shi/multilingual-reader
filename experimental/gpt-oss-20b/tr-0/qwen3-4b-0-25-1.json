    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow. The sentence structure largely mirrors the French original, and complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are expressed in straightforward language. Minor errors—e.g., using *en* instead of *a* in the welcome line, the misspelled *bacha*, and a few misplaced articles—do not render the text incomprehensible but slightly hinder readability. Overall the listener can grasp the content without undue effort.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but several awkward or incorrect expressions diminish fluency: \"Hola y bienvenido en\" should be \"a\", \"por lo tanto\" is over‑used, “bacha” is a typo, and “Gracias por haber escuchado a nosotros” is unnatural. Additionally, the mixture of English terms such as *fine‑tuning* with Spanish explanations can feel jarring. These issues suggest a good but not flawless level of fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *aprendizaje en contexto* and *grounding* are properly translated. However, the term *fine‑tuning* is left untranslated, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the English phrase. Consistency could be improved by translating it as *ajuste fino* or providing a brief explanation. Overall terminology is understandable but not entirely consistent.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the conversational tone and cultural references appropriate for Spanish listeners. Minor localization touches—such as using “consultor” instead of “consultant”—are appropriate. The overall intent of the original script is preserved, and there are no glaring cultural missteps. The adaptation is effective, though a few phrasing choices could be polished for a smoother local feel.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No essential content from the French original is omitted. The dialogue flow is intact, and all key explanations of AI training concepts are present. The translation adds no unnecessary fluff, and redundant lines are not introduced. Minor punctuation issues aside, the information is complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and largely faithful to the original. It successfully conveys the technical concepts and conversational style, making it accessible to Spanish‑speaking audiences. However, it suffers from a handful of grammatical slips, over‑used connectors, and some untranslated English jargon, which slightly reduce readability and fluency. With minor polishing—particularly correcting the typo, adjusting article usage, and ensuring consistent terminology—the translation would reach a higher standard of naturalness and precision."
