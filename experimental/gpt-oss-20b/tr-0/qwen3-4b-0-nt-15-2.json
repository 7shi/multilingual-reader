  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally comprehensible; sentence structures follow typical Spanish syntax and most ideas are clear. However, a few passages suffer from awkward phrasing and missing accents (e.g., “Apena” instead of “Apenas”), which can hinder quick understanding. Overall readability is solid but not flawless.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the translation captures most expressions naturally, several sentences feel stilted or colloquial for a professional podcast context (e.g., “bachear” for “estudiar” and the literal use of “apoyarse”). Some verb conjugations and prepositions are slightly off, which reduces the overall smoothness. Fluency is decent but has room for improvement.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: “preentrenamiento,” “afinamiento,” “aprendizaje por transferencia,” “ventana de contexto,” and “grounding” → “anclaje.” The acronym ICL is kept with an explanatory note. Minor inconsistencies exist, such as the misspelling “memoría.” Overall terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French content well for a Spanish-speaking audience, preserving the conversational tone and podcast style. Some cultural adaptations could be refined, e.g., replacing “bachear” with a more neutral term. Nonetheless, the intended meaning and humor are largely preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present; the dialogue flow is maintained, and no significant information is omitted. Minor redundancies appear (repeated “Luc” lines), but they mirror the original structure and do not detract from clarity.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers a clear and largely faithful rendition of the French source, making the content understandable for Spanish speakers. Strengths lie in accurate terminology and overall information retention. Areas for improvement include polishing natural flow, correcting typographical errors, and refining colloquial choices to enhance professionalism and readability. With a few edits, it would be ready for publication as a high-quality podcast script."
