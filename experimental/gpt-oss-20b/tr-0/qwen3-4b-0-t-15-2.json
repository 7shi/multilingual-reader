  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable; the sentence structure follows the original fairly closely and complex ideas are explained in a way that most Spanish‑speaking listeners can follow. Minor issues such as missing prepositions (“bienvenido en” instead of “bienvenido a”) and occasional long sentences slightly reduce clarity, but overall the material remains accessible.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several grammatical slips and word‑choice inconsistencies that disrupt the natural flow. For example, “luego le presentar” should be “luego le presenta”, “para darle una cultura general” sounds odd, and the overall rhythm is sometimes stilted. Native speakers would find parts of the text awkward, lowering fluency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are preserved (e.g., preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL) and most are correctly translated. However, some terms such as “grounding” are rendered as “anclaje” without further explanation, which might confuse non‑technical listeners. Consistency is good, but explanatory notes could improve comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and keeps the conversational tone appropriate for a podcast audience. Cultural adaptation is adequate—expressions like “consultor brillante” and “consultor temporal” fit the Spanish context. Minor stylistic adjustments (e.g., using “en” instead of “a” for the podcast name) could enhance naturalness, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are present, and the dialogue structure is preserved. No substantive content is omitted, and redundancies are largely avoided. Minor punctuation errors aside, the translation conveys the full information set clearly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful and understandable, capturing the key ideas and conversational flow of the original French script. Nevertheless, several grammatical mistakes and slightly awkward phrasings affect fluency, and the handling of some technical terms could be more explanatory for a general audience. With minor polishing—particularly in grammar, natural word choice, and a few clarifying notes—the translation would reach a near‑perfect score across all criteria."
