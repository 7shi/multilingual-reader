  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is overall easy to read and follows a logical sentence structure. The dialogue format is preserved, and key ideas are expressed in clear, everyday language. Some long sentences could be broken up for even greater clarity, but overall the target audience can comprehend the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds mostly natural to native Spanish speakers, but there are a few awkward constructions and unnecessary abbreviations (e.g., “AIC (Aprendizaje In‑Contexto)” instead of the expected “ICL” or “Aprendizaje In‑Contexto”). Certain phrases such as “la IA no se perfecciona constantemente” feel slightly literal. Overall fluency is high but not perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly – “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto” and “memoria a corto plazo” are appropriate. However, the use of “AIC” instead of the usual “ICL” is a small inaccuracy. Consistency across the transcript is good.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone, and adapts idioms to Spanish (e.g., “casi olvidarse de la historia” becomes “no tiene ninguna idea de lo que se dijo”). Cultural references are maintained, but the abbreviation slip shows a minor lapse in adaptation. Overall, the cultural context is respected.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French source are present – the explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the consultant vs. expert analogy are all included. No essential content is omitted, and the translation stays concise without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid, capturing the meaning and tone of the original French dialogue. It excels in clarity and technical accuracy, though some minor issues with abbreviations and slightly literal phrasing prevent it from being flawless. With a few adjustments to streamline sentence structure and correct the “AIC” abbreviation, the translation would reach near‑perfect quality."
