    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely intelligible for native speakers.  Sentences are straightforward and the logical flow mirrors the French original.  Minor issues with punctuation (e.g., missing question marks) and some slightly awkward word order slightly reduce the smoothness of reading, but overall the content is comprehensible.  Score: 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most phrases read naturally, there are several spots where the translation feels mechanical or uses non‑standard Spanish phrasing – for example, \"El afinado... ¿es ahí donde interviene el …?\" and the isolated \"Olvida todo.\" The use of quotation marks and capitalization is inconsistent at times.  These quirks interrupt the flow and make the text feel less polished.  Score: 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\".  The acronym ICL is retained and explained.  Consistency is good, and the terminology aligns with standard Spanish NLP vocabulary.  Minor issues include the occasional literal use of English terms like \"grounding\" (anclaje) but overall the translation is accurate.  Score: 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator keeps the overall intent and tone of the podcast.  Cultural references such as \"Buenos días\" for \"Bonjour\" are appropriate, and the style is conversational, matching the original.  Some phrasing could be further localized (e.g., smoother use of interrogatives), but no major cultural misunderstandings appear.  Score: 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French original are present in the Spanish version.  No substantive content is omitted, and the explanations of concepts are maintained.  The translation is concise without unnecessary repetition.  Score: 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the main ideas of the original French script with good technical fidelity and a conversational tone that suits a podcast audience.  Some issues with punctuation, sentence flow, and minor idiomatic choices slightly affect readability and fluency, but these are relatively minor.  Overall, the translation is competent and functional, suitable for native Spanish listeners who are familiar with basic NLP terminology.  Minor editorial polish would bring it to an excellent level."
