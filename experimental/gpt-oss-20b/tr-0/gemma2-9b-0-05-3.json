  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow; the sentence structure mirrors the original and logical flow is preserved. Minor issues include the use of typographic quotes around “olvidado” and a few slightly awkward word orders, but these do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds largely natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, some expressions such as “afianzamiento” and “aprender a andar en bicicleta” feel slightly literal or dated. Overall, grammatical correctness and word choice are solid, with only a handful of minor stylistic slips.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms are mostly preserved: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, and “aprendizaje en contexto” are correctly rendered. Issues arise with “afianzamiento” (better would be “ajuste fino” or “fine‑tuning”) and the literal insertion of the French word “ancrage” instead of the Spanish equivalent “anclaje” or “fundamentación”. Terminology consistency is therefore only partially achieved.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and conversational tone of the original podcast are well maintained. Cultural adaptation is adequate, though some English terms (“grounding”) were mistakenly left untranslated. The Spanish version remains engaging for the target audience, but small improvements could enhance cultural resonance.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French script are present. The translation does not omit any substantive content, and the added explanatory remarks are concise. Redundancies are minimal, and the narrative remains coherent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main ideas effectively and is largely readable and fluent. However, terminological inaccuracies—particularly with “afianzamiento” and the untranslated “ancrage”—affect technical precision. With minor adjustments, the text would achieve higher fidelity to the source."
