  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to read and follows a logical structure. Sentences are clear and the dialogue format is preserved, which helps listeners understand the flow. Minor issues arise in a few long sentences that could be split for better clarity, but overall the content remains comprehensible.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward expressions and colloquial phrasing that may feel out of place for a formal podcast script. Examples include “Lo tienes todo claro” and “Es un bachotaje”. Grammar is generally correct, but smoother phrasing could improve the flow.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well and remain consistent throughout the text. The translation of terms such as ‘pre-entrenamiento’, ‘ajuste fino’, ‘aprendizaje en contexto’, and ‘grounding’ to ‘anclaje’ is appropriate for a Spanish-speaking audience. The occasional use of the original English term (e.g., ICL) is avoided, which is good for clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The script keeps the original intent and purpose, and adapts cultural references appropriately for Spanish listeners. The dialogue maintains a conversational tone suitable for a podcast. Some idioms could be refined (e.g., “Es un bachotaje”), but overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French text are present. No significant information is omitted, and redundancies are minimal. The translation includes all necessary explanations, preserving the intended depth of content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and conveys the original meaning well. Minor refinements in phrasing and some smoother natural language usage would elevate it to a near-flawless level. It is functional and clear for a Spanish-speaking audience, with consistent terminology and faithful adherence to the source material’s intent and structure. The slight awkwardness in a few expressions does not impede comprehension, but polishing those would improve the listener experience overall. Overall, a solid translation that could benefit from light editing for fluency and stylistic polish to match native podcast script standards. The translation demonstrates a strong grasp of both linguistic and contextual nuances, making it suitable for its target audience with only a few minor adjustments needed to achieve a top-tier level of quality."
