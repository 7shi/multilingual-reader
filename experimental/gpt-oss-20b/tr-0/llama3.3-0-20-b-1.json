    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the dialogue’s flow and logical structure. Sentences are mostly short and clear, and technical concepts are explained in a way that a general audience can grasp. Minor redundancy (e.g., “completamente nueva” twice) and a few minor syntactic quirks do not impede understanding. Overall, the text is readable and comprehensible.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds fairly natural for a Spanish-speaking audience. However, there are a few awkward phrasings (e.g., “la IA es como un joven graduado de la universidad” could be smoother as “como un recién graduado”) and occasional missing accents (e.g., “enfoque mas flexible” instead of “enfoque más flexible”). The punctuation and sentence length are generally acceptable, but some sentences feel a bit long and could be broken up for better flow. Overall, the text is fluent but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently and appropriately. Words such as “pre-entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto” and “In‑Context Learning” are correctly translated. The term “grounding” is rendered as “anclaje”, which is acceptable. Minor consistency issues (e.g., “IA no ha ‘olvidado’” instead of “IA no ha olvidado”) exist but do not affect comprehension. The terminology remains clear for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the conversational tone and adapts the cultural references appropriately. The greeting “Hola y bienvenidos” fits the Spanish audience. Some literal phrasings could be more idiomatic, but overall the intent of the original French text is preserved. There are no major cultural misalignments. The adaptation could be slightly improved in terms of idiomatic expressions, but it is generally effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French dialogue is present. No major content is omitted, and the translation retains the same level of detail. The only minor issue is the missing accent in “más” which is a typographical oversight rather than an omission of content. Overall, the translation is complete and concise.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and mostly accurate. It preserves the meaning and flow of the original French dialogue while keeping the technical terms consistent. Minor fluency and typographic issues exist, but they do not significantly hinder comprehension. The translation is suitable for a general Spanish-speaking audience with a good understanding of AI concepts, and it could be polished slightly for a more natural feel in certain places. Overall, the quality is high and demonstrates good command of both languages and the subject matter. "
