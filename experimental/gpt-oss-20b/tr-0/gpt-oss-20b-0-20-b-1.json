  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version uses simple sentence structures that are generally easy to follow. Complex ideas such as pre‑training and fine‑tuning are described in a way that most readers can understand. However, a few sentences feel a bit clunky (e.g., \"se hace posible gracias a la expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo\"). Overall, the text is readable but could be smoother in places.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation reads naturally for a native speaker, but there are several instances of awkward phrasing and occasional literal word choices. For example, \"expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo\" sounds a bit forced, and the repeated use of parentheses for English terms interrupts the flow. Nonetheless, the overall tone remains conversational and appropriate for a podcast script.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"In‑Context Learning\". Consistency is good, although some English terms (e.g., \"prompt\") are left untranslated, which is acceptable in tech contexts. Minor improvements could be made, but the terminology is clear and accurate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the intent and humor of the original French script. Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience, and the overall style matches a podcast introduction. Some expressions could be more idiomatic (e.g., \"solo proporcionarle los documentos\" could be \"proporcionarle únicamente los documentos\"), but the adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the discussion of memory features. No significant information was omitted, and redundancy is kept minimal. The translation remains concise yet thorough.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is a solid, largely faithful rendering of the original French podcast script. It effectively conveys the technical concepts and maintains the conversational tone. Minor issues with fluency and occasional literal phrasing prevent it from being perfect, but overall it is suitable for native Spanish speakers and keeps the content clear and engaging."
