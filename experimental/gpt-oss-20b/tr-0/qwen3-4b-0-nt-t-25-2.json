    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the original flow, but several long sentences feel awkward and some wording is a bit clunky, which can make it harder for a native reader to follow the argument smoothly. Minor mistranslations (e.g., “antidesinfección” instead of “antiseña”) also distract. Overall readability is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several grammatical slips and unnatural phrasing (e.g., \"la IA no se afinan\" instead of \"la IA no se afina\", “la IA no se afinan constantemente” with a plural verb), and some word choices feel forced. The rhythm of the sentences is sometimes uneven, but the general tone remains conversational. Fluency is acceptable but could be polished.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are used correctly and consistently. However, the mistranslation of “antisèche” to “antidesinfección” is a clear error that undermines terminology accuracy. Overall, terminology is handled well except for this one slip.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation stays true to the original intent and keeps the casual podcast style. Cultural adaptation is minimal but adequate. There are no major misinterpretations, though some expressions (e.g., the use of quotation marks around technical terms) could be smoothed out. Contextual adaptation is strong.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All sections of the original dialogue are present; nothing significant is omitted. Minor grammatical errors do not affect the conveyance of meaning. The translator keeps the content concise and clear, though some repetition could be trimmed. Completeness is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the gist of the French script and uses appropriate technical vocabulary most of the time. However, several grammatical errors and awkward word choices reduce readability and fluency. The mistranslation of key terms (e.g., \"antisèche\" → \"antidesinfección\") is a notable flaw that should be corrected. With some revision, the translation could achieve a higher level of polish and naturalness for a native Spanish-speaking audience. Overall, it is competent but needs editing for final use. 14/20 average score. 14.4/20 total when averaged across criteria. 14.4 points."
