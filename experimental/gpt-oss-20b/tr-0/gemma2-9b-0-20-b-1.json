  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally easy to follow, with most ideas clearly expressed and the dialogue format preserved. Minor grammatical errors (e.g., *los palabras*, *Esta enfoque*) slightly interrupt the flow, but overall readers can understand the content without major confusion.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds mostly natural to a Spanish speaker, but there are noticeable awkward constructions such as *proporcionarle los documentos* and the accidental retention of the French word *ancrage*. These moments reduce the smoothness of the translation. The overall tone is conversational, which suits a podcast transcript.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly translated correctly (*pre-entrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*). However, inconsistencies arise: *fine‑tuning* is rendered as *afinado* in one place and *afinación* in another, and the French word *ancrage* is left untranslated. The choice of *grounding* as *ancrage* is incorrect. Consistency and complete adaptation of terminology would improve the translation.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator largely preserves the intent and style of the original French text. Cultural references remain appropriate, and the Spanish version keeps the podcast’s informal, conversational style. Minor mismatches, such as the use of the original French title *Tech Éclair* in the Spanish ending, do not significantly harm the adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present; no substantive content is omitted. Redundancies are minimal, and the translation keeps the dialogue concise while conveying the same technical explanations. Small wording issues do not detract from the overall completeness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the essence of the original French dialogue and is largely comprehensible. However, a number of grammatical slips, inconsistent terminology, and occasional untranslated French terms reduce the overall quality. With a bit of polishing—especially in terms of consistent technical vocabulary and smoother phrasing—the translation would reach a higher standard of fluency and professionalism for a native Spanish audience."
