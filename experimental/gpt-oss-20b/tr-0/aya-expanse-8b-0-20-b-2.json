  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation keeps the structure of the original dialogue and explains complex ideas in a straightforward way. Sentences are short, and the use of parenthetical clarifications (e.g., the explanation of *grounding*) helps readers follow the conversation. Minor syntactic quirks do not hinder comprehension. Score: 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural for a Spanish-speaking audience. However, there are a few awkward phrasings such as \"cuando abre una nueva ventana, empieza con un contexto en blanco\" (better would be \"parte de un contexto en blanco\") and inconsistent capitalization of *aprendizaje en contexto*. The final line contains a punctuation mishap and an incorrect program name. These issues slightly detract from the flow. Score: 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: *pre-entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *anclaje*, *memoria*, etc. The terminology is consistent throughout the script, and no key concept is omitted. Score: 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator generally adapts the style to a conversational podcast format suitable for Spanish listeners. The cultural context is respected, but the inadvertent change from \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Tech Luz\" in the closing line breaks the intended branding and could confuse listeners. Aside from that, idiomatic expressions are appropriate. Score: 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French text are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the temporary vs permanent nature of knowledge, and the notion of a memory feature. No essential detail is omitted, and redundant phrasing is avoided. Score: 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely faithful and clear, effectively conveying the technical explanations and the informal tone of the original podcast. Minor issues—especially the incorrect program name in the final line and a few slightly awkward phrasings—lower the overall polish. With small revisions, the script would read smoothly for a native Spanish audience."
