  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is mostly easy to read. Sentences follow a logical order and concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in a way that non‑technical listeners can grasp. Some sentences are a bit long but remain comprehensible. Minor readability hiccups arise from a few overly literal translations (e.g., \"Le preentrenamiento\" instead of a more natural \"el pre‑entrenamiento\"), yet overall the text stays clear.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds largely natural to a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, a few expressions feel slightly forced or informal – e.g., \"Se tiene la impresión\" or the bold formatting of certain terms. Grammar is generally correct, but there are instances of unnecessary literalness (\"le hemos proporcionado\" instead of \"le hemos dado\"), and some phrases could flow better with more idiomatic wording. Despite these minor issues, the text reads smoothly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled appropriately: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\" match common Spanish equivalents. Consistency is maintained throughout, and no key terms are omitted. There is a slight stylistic choice to translate \"Fine‑tuning\" as \"Afinamiento\" rather than the more common \"ajuste fino\", but it is still understandable. Overall, terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, making it accessible to Spanish listeners. Cultural adaptation is generally adequate: idiomatic expressions are mostly avoided, and references (e.g., to a university graduate) resonate across Spanish‑speaking cultures. Minor improvements could be made to avoid overly literal phrasing, but the text effectively conveys the podcast’s conversational style.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is present; no sections are omitted. The translation keeps the same structure, dialogue turns, and explanatory details. Redundancy is avoided, and the content remains concise while fully covering the technical concepts discussed. Thus, the translation is complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is a faithful and clear rendering of the original French script. It retains the conversational tone and technical accuracy expected of a podcast aimed at a general audience. Minor fluency and stylistic adjustments would polish the text further, but overall it meets the criteria for readability, terminology, and completeness with only slight room for improvement in naturalness and cultural tailoring. The translation effectively serves its purpose of educating listeners about AI learning processes in Spanish-speaking contexts. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation with a few small refinements possible. The average score is 16.4 out of 20, indicating strong performance across all evaluation dimensions. Good job, and keep polishing the subtle natural‑language touches for an even smoother finish!."
