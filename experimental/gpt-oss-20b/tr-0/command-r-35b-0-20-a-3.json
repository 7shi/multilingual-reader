  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is generally clear and follows a logical sentence structure. The content is easy to understand for Spanish‑speaking listeners, and the concepts are well explained. A minor hiccup is the presence of the English word \"begins\" in one sentence, which slightly interrupts the flow, but this does not significantly affect overall readability.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural and smooth to native speakers. The choice of vocabulary is contemporary, and the phrasing is appropriate. However, there are a few small issues: the use of \"Lo han entendido todo\" feels slightly awkward, and the accidental retention of the English word \"begins\" detracts from full fluency. Overall, the text reads well.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly translated and consistently applied: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", and \"In-Context Learning\". Explanations are provided where necessary, and terminology matches the target audience's likely level of understanding.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references appropriately. \"pódcast\" with an accent is uncommon; \"podcast\" would be more natural, but the meaning is clear. The use of \"bachillerato\" instead of a direct translation of \"bachotage\" is an acceptable localization. Overall, the content is adapted well for Spanish listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French text is present. There is no omission of important points, and the added or slightly rephrased elements (e.g., turning a statement into a question) do not change the meaning. Redundancy is kept minimal and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality and largely faithful to the original. It captures the technical concepts and conversational tone well, with only minor errors that do not impede understanding. A few small adjustments (removing the English word \"begins\" and normalizing certain idiomatic choices) would bring it to perfection. Overall, the translation serves its purpose effectively for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
