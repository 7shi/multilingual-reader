  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version retains the clear, step‑by‑step explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning. Sentence structures are mostly logical, though some long sentences could be split for easier reading. The core ideas remain understandable to a general audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural in most parts, but a few awkward expressions appear: *\"Imaginen que enviamos una IA totalmente nueva a la escuela…\"* should be *\"Imagina que enviamos una IA totalmente nueva a la escuela…\"*; *\"Lo has entendido todo\"* feels slightly informal. Overall, grammar and vocabulary are contemporary, but these minor slip‑ups affect flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *anclaje*, and *memoria a corto plazo*. The translator explains concepts appropriately without over‑simplification, and term consistency is maintained throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent is preserved, and cultural references are adapted reasonably (e.g., Spanish colloquialisms like *\"El propio modelo no aprende ni evoluciona…\"*). The translation considers the target audience’s context without unnecessary localisation. Minor improvements could be made for smoother local flavour, but overall adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French text appear: the explanation of training phases, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory limitations, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No major omissions, and redundancy is avoided.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and faithful to the original, providing clear explanations of complex AI concepts. Minor fluency issues and occasional unnatural phrasing slightly reduce the reading experience, but overall the text is accurate, well‑structured, and accessible to a Spanish‑speaking audience. With a few adjustments for smoother naturalness, it would reach an excellent standard of translation quality. The average score is 18.4 out of 20, reflecting strong performance across all criteria with room for refinement in fluency and style."
