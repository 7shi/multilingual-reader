  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version uses simple, clear sentence structures that make the content easy to follow. The dialogue stays conversational and avoids overly complex phrasing, so readers can understand the concepts without difficulty. Minor sentence fragments (e.g., “Ha comprendido todo.”) slightly interrupt flow, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads largely naturally for a Spanish speaker, but a few expressions feel literal or slightly awkward. Phrases such as \"Ha comprendido todo.\" or the abrupt use of quotes around ICL are not idiomatic. Word choice is generally good, but smoother alternatives could improve flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and appropriately translated: \"ajuste fino\" for fine‑tuning, \"ventana de contexto\" for context window, \"aprendizaje en contexto\" for ICL. The term \"grounding\" is rendered as \"anclaje,\" which is acceptable. Some terms could be further clarified (e.g., adding a brief explanation of ICL), but overall consistency is good.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone while adapting greetings and colloquial expressions to Spanish culture. It appropriately handles French terms that are kept in their original form. Minor cultural tweaks (e.g., using \"Hola\" instead of \"Bonjour\") are correct and enhance relevance to Spanish listeners.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant information is omitted. All dialogue lines are present, and the core explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL, and memory features are fully conveyed. The translation adds no extraneous content and avoids unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation faithfully conveys the original content and is largely clear and readable for Spanish-speaking audiences. Some phrasing feels slightly literal, and a few idiomatic expressions could be refined for smoother flow. Terminology is handled correctly, and the cultural adaptation is appropriate. Overall, the translation is of high quality and suitable for its intended audience with minor improvements possible in fluency and stylistic polish.\n\nScore: 17/20"
