    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow and the sentence structure remains close to the original, allowing readers to grasp the discussion without confusion. Some clauses, however, are slightly worded in a formal or slightly stilted manner (“Imaginen que enviamos una IA completamente nueva a la escuela”), which may feel a little unnatural in conversational Spanish but does not hinder understanding. Overall, the text is comprehensible and logically organized.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds fairly natural and uses appropriate contemporary vocabulary. There are a few minor awkward phrasing issues – for instance, “Imaginen que enviamos una IA completamente nueva a la escuela” could be phrased more fluidly – and a few tense inconsistencies (“Le ajustaremos” vs. “El ajuste fino”). These do not majorly disrupt the flow, but they slightly lower the fluency compared to a native‑speaker polish.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning (ajuste fino), aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL (aprendizaje en contexto), ventana de contexto, anclaje (grounding). The translator provides clear explanations for concepts such as “transfer learning” and “grounding.” No major mistranslations or inconsistencies appear, and the terminology is appropriate for a general audience familiar with AI concepts.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast script. Cultural adaptation is handled well: opening lines are localized, and expressions like “¡Hola y bienvenidos!” suit Spanish-speaking listeners. The content remains conversational and engaging. There is no misinterpretation of culturally specific references, and the overall feel aligns with the original French version.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory. Minor wording differences do not omit any concept. The translator avoids unnecessary repetition while maintaining conciseness. No crucial information is missing, and the narrative flow remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is strong and faithful to the source material. It preserves technical accuracy and the conversational tone expected in a podcast script. Minor refinements in phrasing and tense consistency could elevate fluency further, but the current version communicates the content effectively and naturally for a Spanish-speaking audience. Overall, a high‑quality translation that serves the intended purpose well and maintains clarity throughout the episode transcript.  \nScore: 90/100 (average 18/20).  \nThis score reflects excellent readability, solid terminology usage, and good contextual adaptation, with slight room for improvement in naturalness and minor editorial polish.  \nEnd of evaluation."
