  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely comprehensible; the sentences are short and the structure follows the original dialogue. Minor issues include the misplaced article in \"le preentrenamiento\" and the inconsistent gender of \"la IA\" vs. \"el modelo\", but these do not prevent understanding. The concepts are explained in a clear, logical order.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall, the translation reads smoothly, but several grammatical errors interrupt the flow: incorrect article usage (e.g., \"le preentrenamiento\"), inconsistent gender references to \"IA\", and some awkward phrasing such as \"le olvidó todo\". These irregularities reduce naturalness for a native speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\". The terminology is consistent throughout and appropriate for the target audience. A few terms like \"grounding\" are translated as \"anclaje\", which is acceptable, though a more common term might be \"fundamentación\". Overall, terminology is handled very well.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the opening and closing lines to Spanish (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenidos\") and uses culturally appropriate expressions. Minor redundancies appear (\"¡hasta la próxima en el próximo episodio…\"). The overall intent and tone of the original are preserved, but a couple of small stylistic improvements could be made.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the original French are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No major omissions or added content; the translation remains concise yet complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is strong in conveying meaning and technical accuracy, but it suffers from occasional grammatical slips and minor stylistic inconsistencies that affect fluency. It would benefit from a final proofreading round to polish article usage and gender agreement, which would raise it to near‑perfect status for a native Spanish audience. Overall, a solid and useful translation with room for small refinements."
