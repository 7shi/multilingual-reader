  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and easy to understand. Sentences are logically structured and complex ideas are broken down in a way that a native speaker would grasp without difficulty. Minor instances of repetition (e.g., “Lo has entendido todo.”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly in most parts, but a few phrases feel slightly literal or informal for a podcast transcript, such as “Lo has entendido todo.” and “Lo olvidó todo.” The overall tone remains natural, and there are no major grammatical errors.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: “preentrenamiento,” “afinamiento,” “aprendizaje por transferencia,” “ventana de contexto,” “Aprendizaje In‑Context,” and “anclaje.” The use of “Memoria” for the feature is appropriate. Some consistency issues arise with capitalisation (“ICL” vs “Aprendizaje In‑Context”), but overall terminology is suitable for a general audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational style while adapting cultural references (e.g., greeting with “Hola” and mentioning “Tech Éclair”). It remains accessible to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor phrasing could be slightly more idiomatic, but no significant cultural mismatches are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No essential information was omitted, and redundancies were largely avoided. The translation stays concise while maintaining clarity.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is very solid: it maintains the original meaning, employs appropriate terminology, and is mostly fluent. Minor tweaks could improve naturalness, but overall the version effectively conveys the content to a Spanish‑speaking audience without significant errors or omissions. The translator demonstrates good control of both language and subject matter, resulting in a near‑perfect adaptation suitable for a podcast audience. Overall quality: excellent, with only minor polish needed for a truly native feel. Score: 18.4/20 (rounded to 18)."
