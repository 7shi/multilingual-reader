    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish transcript is largely clear and logical. Most sentences are concise and follow a natural order. The speaker turns are easy to follow and the explanation of concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning is understandable. The only small issue is the occasional long sentence that could be split for easier reading, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. However, there are a few non‑standard spellings (e.g., \"pré-entrenamiento\" instead of \"preentrenamiento\") and the phrase \"se le proporciona una hoja de ayuda\" feels a bit literal. These minor slips slightly detract from perfect fluency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "All key technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, short‑term memory, context window, etc. The consistency of terms such as \"afinamiento\" for fine‑tuning and \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" for transfer learning is commendable. The occasional use of the English word \"prompt\" could be replaced with a Spanish equivalent, but it is understood in the field.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts well to Spanish cultural norms. The conversational tone and use of interjections (e.g., \"¡Exactamente!\") match the original style. The choice to keep certain English terms as is (e.g., ICL) reflects common practice among Spanish‑speaking tech audiences. No cultural references are lost, and the overall intent of explaining AI concepts remains intact.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French original is present. The explanation of the differences between in‑context learning and fine‑tuning, the discussion of memory features, and the concluding remarks are all retained. There is no omission of content, and redundancy is minimal. The translation stays concise while keeping the necessary detail.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality. It preserves the meaning, technical accuracy, and conversational flow of the original French text. Minor spelling and word‑choice issues slightly reduce fluency, but they do not impede understanding. Overall, the translation is clear, technically sound, and culturally appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts. The average score across the five criteria is 17.4 out of 20, reflecting strong performance with room for polishing some lexical choices and typographical conventions. The translation effectively conveys the original intent and content, making it a reliable resource for Spanish‑speaking listeners of the podcast. "
