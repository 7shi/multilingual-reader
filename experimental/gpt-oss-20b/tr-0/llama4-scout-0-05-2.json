  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally easy to follow, with clear sentence structure and logical progression. Minor issues include the standalone sentence “El pre‑entrenamiento” and a few minor grammatical slips, but overall readers can comprehend the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural in most places, but there are a few awkward or formal expressions such as “Usted lo ha entendido todo” and repeated phrases (“Ella se olvida de todo”). Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, though occasional repetition reduces fluidity.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly – “pre‑entrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning” (as “el ajuste”), “in‑context learning” (“aprendizaje en contexto”), “grounding” (“anclaje”). The translation remains consistent and understandable for a general audience, with no major omissions or misused terms.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent and tone are preserved, and cultural references are suitably adapted. Minor formalities (e.g., “Usted”) slightly alter tone but do not impede comprehension. Overall, the adaptation respects the target audience’s expectations.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present. There are no significant omissions, and the translation avoids unnecessary redundancy while keeping the content concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the original message accurately and clearly, with a strong grasp of technical terminology and context. While some minor phrasing issues affect fluency slightly, the overall quality is high and suitable for a general Spanish‑speaking audience. The translation would benefit from minor style edits to eliminate repetition and adjust formal tones for consistency, but it remains a solid, professional rendering of the original podcast script. The average score reflects an overall quality of 18/20, indicating a very good translation with room for small refinements. If you aim for publication or broadcasting, consider a final stylistic polish to ensure optimal naturalness across all passages.  "
