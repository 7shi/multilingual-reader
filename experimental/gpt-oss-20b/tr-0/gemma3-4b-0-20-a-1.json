    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely clear and follows a logical structure. Sentences are short enough for easy comprehension, and the speaker roles are consistently marked. However, some sentences feel slightly awkward in Spanish (e.g., *«El aprendizaje en contexto es bachorear…»*), which can momentarily disrupt flow. Overall, readability is solid but not perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly in most places, but there are several instances of slightly unnatural phrasing or grammatical oddities – for example, *«en la escuela»* instead of *«a la escuela»* and the repeated *«se olvida todo»* feels clunky. Vocabulary choice is generally appropriate, though some expressions could be more idiomatic. Fluency is good but could be refined.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre-entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto* (ICL), and *anclaje* are used consistently and correctly. There is no noticeable misuse of terminology, and the translation stays true to the original technical sense. Terminology is handled well.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version stays very close to the original French wording, which preserves intent but leaves little room for cultural tailoring. Minor cultural adaptations (e.g., using *«consultor brillante»* instead of *«consultant brillant»*) are present, yet some expressions feel literal. Overall, contextual adaptation is adequate but could be more nuanced.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are present in the Spanish translation. No significant information was omitted, and the logical flow of ideas is maintained. Minor stylistic redundancies exist but do not compromise clarity. The content is complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and largely faithful to the source. Readability and fluency are good, though a few phrases feel slightly awkward or overly literal. Technical terminology is handled correctly, and the overall message remains intact. Some smoothing of the language and a bit more cultural adaptation would elevate the quality to near‑native level, but as it stands, the translation is solid and understandable for Spanish‑speaking audiences who are familiar with the subject matter. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation with room for minor polish to reach the very best naturalness and flow for native listeners or readers in Spanish‑speaking contexts. The final overall score reflects this balanced assessment: **17/20**."
