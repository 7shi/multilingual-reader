  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to understand, with clear explanations of complex concepts and logical sentence structure. However, a few sentences feel slightly literal (e.g., *« para darle una cultura general »*), and there are minor typographical issues such as missing accents on *masiva* and *máquina*. These small errors slightly reduce readability but do not hinder comprehension significantly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly for most native speakers, using appropriate idiomatic expressions. Nonetheless, occasional literal phrasing (e.g., *« Miren: no le enseñarías las matemáticas básicas »*) and a few punctuation inconsistencies create a slightly disjointed flow. The overall naturalness remains high but not perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely well‑handled: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *anclaje*, *memoria*. The terminology is consistent throughout and aligned with contemporary usage in Spanish tech literature. Minor lexical choices (e.g., *« memoria »* for the feature) are appropriate, though *grounding* could also be rendered as *« fundamentación »* for clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original's intent and conversational tone. Cultural adaptation is adequate—Spanish idioms replace French ones where necessary. Some expressions remain overly literal (e.g., the question form *« ¿Es una artimaña? »* mirrors the original but feels slightly abrupt). Overall, the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential points from the original are preserved: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No significant content is omitted, and the translation adds no extraneous material. Minor typographical errors do not affect informational integrity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation demonstrates strong fidelity to the source text, effectively conveying complex concepts with largely accurate terminology and maintaining the intended tone. Minor issues—mostly typographical and slightly literal phrasing—prevent it from reaching perfect fluency. Overall, it is a competent and professional translation suitable for native Spanish‑speaking audiences."
