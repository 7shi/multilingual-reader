  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version keeps the conversational flow of the original and uses clear, mostly simple sentence structures. Some lines are a bit awkward – e.g., *Lo ha entendido todo* or *Esto es un truco?* – which may momentarily confuse native readers, but the overall sense is easy to grasp. Punctuation and spacing are generally correct, though a few minor typos (e.g., *le verbe* → *qué es un verbo*) appear. Overall, the text is quite readable but not perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly in most places, and the choice of words is mostly appropriate. However, occasional literal translations of English idioms (*prompt* is left as is, *fine‑tuning* as *afinamiento*) and some unnatural phrasing (e.g., *Lo ha entendido todo*) reduce the naturalness. Despite these quirks, the passage flows well and would be understood by Spanish speakers without effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled mostly correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *fin‑tuning* → *afinamiento*, *learning by transfer* → *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *context window* → *ventana de contexto*, *grounding* → *anclaje*. The consistency is good, though *afinamiento* is less common than *ajuste fino* in Spanish NLP circles. The translation explains concepts when needed, keeping the terminology accessible to a non‑expert audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The brand name *Tech Éclair* is retained as *Tech Éclair* for most of the text, but the closing line changes it to *Tecno Relámpago*, which may confuse listeners familiar with the original. Aside from that, cultural references are appropriate and the tone matches a casual podcast. The adaptation is mostly faithful but could benefit from a consistent brand name.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the original French transcript are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No significant omissions are detected, and the added explanations aid understanding. The translation keeps the same level of detail and clarity, thus maintaining informational completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid overall, capturing the main concepts and conversational tone of the original. Minor issues with naturalness and a slight brand inconsistency reduce its polish, but the text remains clear, accurate, and well‑structured. A few phrasing tweaks and a consistent brand name would elevate it to near‑flawless quality.\n\nOverall score: 16/20 (average of the five criteria)."
