  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly easy to follow, with clear sentence structures and logical flow. However, a few long sentences and a minor grammatical mistake (“partes” instead of “parte”) slightly hinder readability. The concepts are explained in a straightforward manner, though some phrasing could be simplified for a broader audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads largely natural and smooth for native Spanish speakers. Some expressions feel slightly literal or awkward, such as \"El aprendizaje en contexto es repasar\" and the erroneous verb form \"partes\". Vocabulary choices are appropriate, but a few phrases could be polished for better fluidity.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well handled: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"anclaje\", and \"memoria\" are all correctly translated and consistently used. No critical terminology was omitted or mistranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, with minor cultural adaptation. Spanish idiomatic expressions are mostly appropriate, though a few literal phrasings could be improved. Overall, the context for Spanish-speaking listeners is maintained.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French transcript are present. No significant omissions or additions were made that would alter meaning, and redundancy is minimal. The slight grammatical error does not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality and faithful to the source material, effectively conveying complex ideas about AI training and context learning. Minor grammatical errors and some slightly awkward phrasing reduce overall fluency, but the document remains clear, technically accurate, and well‑adapted for a Spanish‑speaking audience. With small refinements, it could reach near‑perfect quality in all categories. Overall score: 17/20, reflecting a strong, competent translation that could be polished to a near‑native level with minor adjustments to wording and grammar. The translation successfully balances fidelity, clarity, and naturalness, making it suitable for both technical and general audiences in the Spanish language context."
