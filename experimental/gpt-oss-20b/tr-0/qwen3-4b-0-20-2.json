    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text preserves the dialogue’s flow and most concepts are clear to a native reader.  Some sentence structures are slightly clumsy (“Usted ha entendido todo” instead of the informal “has entendido”) and a few short fragments (“en un programa de formación de varios años”) could be tightened.  Overall, the material is understandable, but a few awkward phrasing choices slightly reduce readability.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation exhibits several unnatural or grammatically incorrect expressions – e.g. “Usted ha entendido todo”, “le darle”, “pronto para el próximo episodio”.  Word choice is mostly fine, but the inconsistent use of formal and informal second‑person forms and occasional missing accents (e.g. “enriquezca” vs “enriquecer”) make the text feel somewhat mechanical.  A native speaker would detect these quirks, lowering fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *aprendizaje en contexto* and *anclaje* are correctly rendered and consistently used throughout.  The translator kept the English term *fine‑tuning* in several places, which is acceptable in current tech parlance.  No significant terminology errors or omissions were found.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue’s informal, conversational tone is largely maintained, and cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience.  Minor adaptations could improve localization – for example, changing “¡Hola y bienvenido en « Tech Éclair »” to “¡Hola y bienvenidos a « Tech Éclair »” and adjusting idiomatic expressions (“apertura de ventana” could be “nueva ventana”).  The core intent is preserved, but some phrasing could be more natural.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the consultant vs. expert analogy.  No major omissions or hallucinations occur, and the dialogue remains concise.  Slight re‑wording in a few places does not affect the overall content.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation effectively conveys the technical content and conversational tone of the original podcast script.  However, several grammatical slips and unnatural phrasing reduce the overall polish.  With a few targeted edits—especially correcting second‑person form, tightening short sentences, and refining idiomatic expressions—the text would read as a natural, native Spanish dialogue while retaining all technical accuracy."
