  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is overall easy to read; sentences follow a logical flow and complex ideas are explained in a clear manner. However, a few longer sentences could be split for better digestibility. Minor issues such as the literal use of “resumen” for “antisèche” slightly reduce clarity. Overall, readers can understand the content with little effort.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish sounds natural in most places, but some phrasing feels slightly mechanical – e.g., “la IA no se está afinando constantemente” and “se le ha proporcionado un resumen justo antes de que comience a hablarle”. These do not impede comprehension but could be more idiomatic. Grammar is mostly correct and vocabulary is contemporary.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are preserved accurately: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL. The term “Memoria” is capitalized, which is acceptable. Consistency is maintained, though the acronym ICL could have been highlighted or kept in parentheses for clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and tone, and adapts cultural references appropriately. The Spanish audience will recognize the analogies and explanations. No major cultural mismatches are present. A few expressions could be tweaked for more native fluidity, but overall adaptation is good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All lines and dialogue exchanges are present; nothing essential is omitted. The translator kept the same structure and content. Redundancies are not introduced, and the script remains concise. Minor nuances (e.g., “antisèche”) could be more precisely rendered, but the overall information is intact.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and largely faithful to the original French script. It preserves the meaning, tone, and technical content while maintaining readability for Spanish-speaking listeners. Minor adjustments could improve naturalness and precision, but these do not significantly detract from the quality. Overall, the translation meets the standards for a clear, engaging podcast script."
