  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely clear and logically organized, mirroring the conversational tone of the original French script. Sentences are mostly straightforward and easy to follow, and complex concepts (like pre‑training and fine‑tuning) are explained in a way that most Spanish‑speaking readers can grasp. Minor issues arise only in a few longer sentences where the flow feels slightly mechanical, but these do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker, and vocabulary choices are appropriate. However, there are a few slightly awkward phrasings (e.g., \"Imaginen que enviamos una IA completamente nueva a la escuela...\" and \"Es una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\"). The overall tone is natural for a podcast script, but a few idiomatic tweaks could improve the flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently and appropriately: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", and \"anclaje\" are all correctly translated and used consistently. The abbreviation ICL is kept as is, which is acceptable in a tech‑focused context. No key terms are omitted or mistranslated, and explanations are sufficient for a general audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal, conversational nature of the original French podcast. Cultural references are minimal, but the adaptation maintains the intended humor and clarity for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Some phrasing could be further localized (e.g., \"cajas negras\" vs. \"cajas negras\" is fine), but overall the target audience’s perspective is respected and the message is clearly conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original is present; no significant content is omitted. The Spanish version keeps the same structure and details, providing concise explanations where necessary. Minor wording differences do not result in loss of meaning, and redundancy is avoided while maintaining clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the original French script’s meaning, tone, and technical content. It is largely readable, fluent, and complete, with only a few small stylistic adjustments that could further enhance naturalness. This makes it suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience in a podcast setting, effectively preserving the intent and engagement of the source material. The overall score reflects its strong performance across all evaluation criteria, with room for minor polish in phrasing to reach perfect naturalness."
