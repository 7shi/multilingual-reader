  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the flow mirrors the original dialogue, making the content accessible to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Some longer sentences could be split for extra clarity, but overall comprehensibility is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally for most native speakers. However, a few awkward expressions appear: e.g., “Aprendizaje In-Contexto” (instead of the more common “aprendizaje en contexto”), occasional mismatched singular/plural (“informaciones”), and minor grammatical slips (“asombrosamente baja”). These do not impede understanding but slightly detract from smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled accurately and consistently: “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “anclaje”, “ventana de contexto”. The only inconsistency is the abbreviation “AIC”, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the original “ICL”. Overall, terminology is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the conversational tone of a podcast, uses Spanish idioms appropriately, and adapts cultural references. Minor issues include the plural “informaciones” and the unusual abbreviation “AIC”, but these do not alter the intended meaning.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present. The only slight omission is the explicit mention of the original abbreviation “ICL”; instead, the translator introduces “AIC”. The overall message remains intact, and no essential content was lost.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version conveys the podcast’s content accurately and with good readability. While there are a few minor fluency hiccups and an abbreviation that could cause confusion, the translation is solid and suitable for a general Spanish‑speaking audience. It scores well across all criteria and would be considered a high‑quality translation overall. The only recommendation is to standardize the abbreviation to avoid potential misunderstandings (e.g., use “ICL” or explain it fully). Overall, it achieves a 17/20 score, reflecting a very good quality translation with room for minor polish."
