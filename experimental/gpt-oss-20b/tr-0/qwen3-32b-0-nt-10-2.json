    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to read; sentence structures are clear and the flow mirrors the original conversational style. The explanation of concepts such as pre‑training and transfer learning is straightforward. Minor readability hiccups exist (e.g., the abrupt “o AIC” phrase and a few commas missing), but overall a native Spanish speaker would understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text mostly sounds natural and fluid. However, some phrases feel slightly mechanical or literal—e.g., \"la IA no está constantemente afinada por tus conversaciones\" and the use of the abbreviation \"AIC\" with a parenthetical expansion that is uncommon in Spanish. Vocabulary choices are mostly appropriate, though a few expressions could be smoothed out for a more conversational tone.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\" and \"memoria\" are all accurate and consistently used. The only minor inconsistency is the introduction of the abbreviation \"AIC\" instead of the more common \"ICL\". Overall terminology is clear and appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the informal, friendly tone of the original podcast. Cultural references are minimal, but the text is adapted to Spanish‑speaking listeners (e.g., using \"tus conversaciones\" instead of \"tu conversación\"). The abrupt insertion of \"AIC (Aprendizaje In-Contexto)\" may confuse readers who are more familiar with \"ICL\", slightly reducing contextual clarity.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original is present; no key ideas are omitted. The expansion of \"AIC\" and the slight abbreviation mismatch could be seen as an oversight, but the overall content remains intact and concise. No redundant sections were added.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid overall, accurately conveying the main ideas and maintaining a conversational tone suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor fluency adjustments and consistency in abbreviations would further polish the text, but it already serves its purpose well as a faithful adaptation of the French original."
