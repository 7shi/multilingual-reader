  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the main ideas are conveyed clearly. The sentence structure is mostly logical, though a few repetitive phrasing (e.g., repeated use of “por lo tanto”) slightly reduces readability. Minor awkwardness in phrasing such as “se le da simplemente la información de la que necesita” may momentarily confuse a native reader. Overall the content is comprehensible.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is fluent in most parts; however, there are several instances of literal phrasing that sound slightly unnatural to a native Spanish speaker. Examples include “se le da simplemente los documentos de información exactos de los que necesita” and the use of the French word “antisèche” instead of a Spanish equivalent. Grammar is generally correct, but some word choices could be smoother, e.g., “apenas” instead of “apenas” and “se le ha dado solo una antisèche”. These issues lower the fluency slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled well: “preentrenamiento”, “afinado”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto” and “aprendizaje en contexto” are accurately translated. The term “grounding” is rendered as “anclaje”, which is appropriate. Minor inconsistencies appear, such as the use of “antisèche” (borrowed from French) instead of a Spanish synonym. Overall terminology is consistent and suitable for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, but certain expressions could be more idiomatic for Spanish listeners. Phrases like “se le da simplemente la información de la que necesita” are a bit literal. Cultural adaptation is adequate but could be improved by choosing more natural phrasing and avoiding direct French loanwords unless common. The overall adaptation is functional but not fully optimized.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the translation keeps the dialogue structure intact. Minor redundancy is present but does not obscure meaning. The text remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and effectively conveys the original dialogue’s meaning. It scores well in readability, terminology, and completeness, though fluency and contextual adaptation could be enhanced by smoothing some literal phrasings and avoiding non‑Spanish loanwords where unnecessary. Overall, it is a competent translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but with room for polishing to reach native naturalness."
