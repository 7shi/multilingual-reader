  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is mostly clear and easy to follow. Long sentences are occasionally a bit heavy but the overall structure mirrors the French source, making concepts understandable for a general audience. Minor literalness can slightly hinder flow but does not obstruct comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally for a Spanish speaker overall. However, some expressions feel a bit literal, e.g. \"Cuando abres una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío\" or \"la IA no ha «olvidado» en el sentido humano del término\". A few awkward word choices like \"afinamiento\" for fine‑tuning and missing articles slightly reduce smoothness. Nonetheless, the translation remains conversational and appropriate for a podcast transcript.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, memoria. The translator chose consistent equivalents and explained concepts when needed. Some terms could be rendered more commonly as \"ajuste fino\" or \"aprendizaje en contexto\" but the chosen terms are understood in the target audience. Overall terminology is accurate and coherent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, adapts cultural references appropriately, and keeps the podcast‑friendly style. Minor adjustments could improve local flavor (e.g., using \"ventana de contexto\" instead of \"ventana de contexto\"), but the adaptation is effective and culturally neutral. No loss of meaning occurs through cultural mismatch.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present in the Spanish text. No substantive omissions were detected, and the translation keeps the dialogue structure and explanations intact. The only slight variance is the omission of the parenthetical clarification about ICL’s acronym (explicación en la frase \"aprender en contexto, o ICL\") but this is understood from context. Redundancy is minimal, and the text stays concise and clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is overall high quality: faithful, understandable, and largely natural. Minor improvements in flow and some more idiomatic wording could elevate it, but it effectively conveys the original content for Spanish‑speaking listeners. A final polish would address a few literal phrases and slightly refine terminology for maximal fluency without sacrificing technical precision."
