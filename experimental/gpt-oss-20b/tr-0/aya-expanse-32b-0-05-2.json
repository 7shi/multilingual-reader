  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to read; sentence structures mirror the French source and maintain logical flow. Complex concepts like pre‑training and fine‑tuning are explained clearly. Minor issues include occasional long sentences that could be split for better clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally smooth for a native Spanish speaker, but some phrases feel slightly mechanical or redundant (e.g., repeated use of \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\" and the abrupt “Lo has entendido todo”). Word choice is appropriate, though occasional phrasing could be more natural.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje. Consistency is good, though the term \"Lenguaje de Comprensión e Generación\" is unusual and likely a mistranslation of ICL. Overall, terminology is handled well.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone. Cultural references are neutral; the brand name \"Tech Éclair\" is retained. Some expressions could be slightly adapted for regional Spanish preferences, but this does not impede understanding.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All substantive content from the French original is present. No critical information is omitted. The text does repeat certain explanations, but this redundancy does not obscure meaning. Overall, information completeness is high.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and largely faithful to the source. It captures the main ideas and technical details accurately, but would benefit from minor stylistic edits to eliminate redundancy and improve naturalness. Overall, it is suitable for a general Spanish‑speaking audience with an interest in AI concepts, though a polish for smoother readability would enhance the listening experience for podcasts or transcripts.  The final score reflects these strengths and small areas for improvement.  Overall score: 18/20."
