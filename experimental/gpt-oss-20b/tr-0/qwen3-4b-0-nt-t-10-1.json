  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and follows a logical sentence structure. Complex ideas are conveyed in an understandable way, and the flow mirrors the original French dialogue. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., missing spaces in “preentrenamiento”) do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly natural for a Spanish-speaking audience, but a few phrases feel literal or awkward – such as “Lo entendiste todo” and “El aprendizaje en contexto, es un bachotaje.” These reflect minor issues with idiomatic flow, reducing overall fluency slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered (e.g., “aprendizaje por transferencia,” “ventana de contexto,” “afinado”). Terminology is consistent throughout and suitable for a general Spanish audience. A small inconsistency appears with the stray English word “Simply”.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Cultural adaptation is adequate; the dialogue feels conversational and the tone aligns with the original. However, certain expressions could be polished for a more natural Spanish idiom (e.g., “se tiene la impresión” instead of “se tiene la impresión”).",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All original information is preserved; no key details are omitted. The only loss is the untranslated word “Simply.” Redundancies are minimal and the translation remains concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the Spanish translation is high‑quality and faithful to the original French text. Minor fluency quirks and a single untranslated English word are the only detractors. The piece reads well and accurately conveys technical concepts, making it suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
