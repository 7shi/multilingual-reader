  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally easy to follow and most dialogues are clear. However, there are several minor grammatical errors (e.g., *le presentas* instead of *le presenta*, *estas* instead of *este*, *a la vuela*). These mistakes slightly impede smooth comprehension but do not obscure the overall meaning.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains several awkward or incorrect expressions that break the natural flow for a native speaker. Examples include the use of *Usted* in informal contexts, the phrase *a la vuela*, and inconsistent verb forms. While the overall tone is conversational, these issues reduce the fluency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled accurately and consistently: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)*, *anclaje*, *ventana de contexto*. Explanations are provided where necessary, and no major terminology errors are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to adapt the original French to Spanish, preserving the informal podcast style. Some cultural nuances are missed due to incorrect pronoun usage and unnatural phrasing (*Usted* in informal speech). Overall, the adaptation is adequate but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are included; no significant content is omitted. Minor rephrasings or omissions in phrasing do not change the conveyed information, and the translation remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation faithfully conveys the original content and preserves technical accuracy, but several grammatical and stylistic errors reduce readability and naturalness. With minor corrections, the text could reach a high standard of fluency and clarity for native speakers. The translation is competent but would benefit from a thorough copy‑editing pass to address the noted issues, especially pronoun consistency and idiomatic phrasing. Overall, the translation is useful for a Spanish‑speaking audience with a technical background but should be refined before publication in a professional context. The overall quality is good, but improvement is needed for a polished final product. Score: 16/20."
