    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow, with most dialogue preserved and clear explanations of concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning. However, some sentences are slightly convoluted – e.g., “Cuando abres una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío” contains a verb agreement error that can momentarily confuse the reader. Overall, the text is readable but could benefit from smoother sentence construction.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural, but a handful of awkward phrasings (“la IA no se afina constantemente”) and a few tense/voice inconsistencies reduce fluidity. Word choice is largely appropriate, though some expressions could be more idiomatic (“afina” instead of “reentrena”). The flow is acceptable but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje en contexto* (ICL), *anclaje* (grounding), *memoria a corto plazo*. Minor nuances such as “memoria” vs “recordatorio” are acceptable. The terminology is clear for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Cultural adaptation is generally good; the script keeps the conversational style of a podcast. The title is kept in French, which is appropriate. Some Spanish idioms (“estudiar para un examen”) fit the context. Overall, the intent and tone are preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present. No substantial omissions were detected. The dialogue flow and key explanations are intact. Minor details, such as the exact wording of the opening line, remain consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate and largely clear, but a few grammatical slips and unnatural phrasings slightly hinder fluency. Terminology is handled well and the cultural adaptation is adequate. Information completeness is good. The translation is suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience but could be polished for full naturalness."
