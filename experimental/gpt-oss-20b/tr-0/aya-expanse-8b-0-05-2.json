  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version keeps the basic sentence structure of the French original and explains the concepts in straightforward language. However, a few constructions are a bit awkward, such as \"se le proporcionan la informaciones\" (the plural \"informaciones\" is uncommon) and the use of \"apuntar\" instead of \"prepararse\" or \"estudiar\". Overall, the text is understandable but not perfectly smooth.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most sentences read naturally, there are several spots that sound forced or incorrect for native Spanish speakers. For example, \"el aprendizaje contextual es como apuntar para un examen\" misuses \"apuntar\"; \"un programa de capacitación\" could be better phrased as \"un programa de formación\"; the repetition of \"se le\" and the use of \"informaciones\" instead of \"información\" are also off. These issues lower the overall fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and appropriate: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\", \"memoria\". Minor inconsistencies (e.g., missing hyphen in \"preentrenamiento\") do not obscure meaning. The translator consistently uses Spanish equivalents for key concepts.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and explains the ideas in a way that would be familiar to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Cultural references are minimal, and the speaker names and titles are kept unchanged. Some phrasing could be more idiomatic, but the overall contextual meaning is preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No significant omissions or additions are detected, and the flow remains logical. Minor redundancy is reduced without losing clarity.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and largely faithful to the original, preserving the key ideas and terminology. However, a few phrasing mistakes and awkward word choices reduce readability and naturalness. With some refinement—especially in idiomatic expressions and verb choices—the text could achieve a higher level of polish suitable for a native Spanish-speaking audience. Overall, it is a good draft but needs final editing for flawless naturalness and consistency. 16/20 is an appropriate overall score, reflecting solid quality with room for improvement in fluency and expression choices.
