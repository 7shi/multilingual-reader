  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the overall structure and meaning of the original text, and most sentences are understandable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Some phrasings feel slightly clunky (e.g., “Pueden tomar un modelo experto… luego presentarle…”) and a few grammatical inaccuracies (“Imaginen que enviamos…”) hinder full clarity, but overall the content is comprehensible.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions feel unnatural to native speakers. For instance, “Usted ha entendido todo” uses a formal pronoun incorrectly, and the translation sometimes mixes informal and formal tones. Punctuation is inconsistent (using both straight and curly quotes), and some verbs are incorrectly conjugated. The flow is generally smooth but these quirks reduce naturalness.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly correctly rendered: \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\", and \"memoria\" are appropriate. Consistency is good, though the translation occasionally drops hyphens (e.g., \"preentrenamiento\" vs. \"pre‑entrenamiento\"). Overall terminology handling is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the intent and humor of the original French script. Cultural references are minimal and thus transfer well. Minor adaptations (e.g., changing the Spanish word order) don't alter meaning, but the overall cultural tone remains appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present. There are no substantial omissions. However, small typographical errors (“Informaciónes”) and the slightly awkward phrasing of certain sentences add minor redundancy and could confuse readers, but the essential information is intact.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely faithful and understandable, with a few issues in fluency and punctuation. Terminology is handled well, and the overall meaning is preserved. With a few adjustments for natural phrasing and consistency, it would be a polished final product suitable for native Spanish listeners of a tech podcast. The translation demonstrates good comprehension of the source material but would benefit from a final proof‑read to address the noted quirks and minor errors. The overall quality is solid but not flawless, reflecting a competent but slightly imperfect translation effort. The final score reflects an average of the individual criterion scores and indicates that the translation is good but could be refined for full professional polish."
