  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, but several sentences contain awkward phrasing or literal translations that can confuse a native reader (e.g., \"se olvida de todo\" is fine, but \"afinamento\" is a non‑Spanish word). The logical flow is preserved, yet the lack of proper gender agreement in some verbs and the occasional heavy use of French terms slightly hinder comprehension. Overall, the text can be followed but would benefit from smoother phrasing.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences read naturally; however, the translation contains a few unidiomatic expressions and a few grammatical errors (e.g., the misspelled \"afinamento\" instead of \"ajuste fino\"). The punctuation and use of quotation marks are correct, and the conversational tone is maintained. Minor adjustments would bring the text to full fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\". The word \"fine‑tuning\" was incorrectly rendered as \"afinamento\" (a Portuguese form) instead of the accepted Spanish \"ajuste fino\" or \"entrenamiento fino\", which is a significant terminology error. Aside from this, other terms are accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent of the podcast and the conversational style are preserved. The translation keeps the informal tone and uses Spanish equivalents for expressions like \"exactamente\" and \"una gran pregunta\". Cultural adaptation is adequate, but the presence of untranslated French terminology in some parts reduces contextual fit. The translation could further localize references (e.g., adjusting idioms), yet it remains largely faithful.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the memory feature. No essential content is omitted, and the explanations are clear enough for the target audience. Slight redundancy is present but does not obscure meaning. Therefore, the translation is comprehensive.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers the core content accurately and keeps the conversational tone, but it contains several terminology mistakes and slightly awkward phrasing that reduce readability and fluency. Correcting the misspelled \"afinamento\" to a proper Spanish term, smoothing a few literal translations, and tightening some sentences would elevate the quality to near‑native level. Overall, the translation is good but needs polishing for professional use, especially in technical contexts where precise terminology is crucial. The final overall score reflects these strengths and weaknesses: 15/20 (average of individual criteria)."
