    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is overall easy to read. Sentence structures are mostly coherent and the flow mimics the conversational tone of the original. Minor issues include some slightly awkward phrasing (e.g., “Cuando abres una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío.”) and a few long sentences that could be broken up for clarity. Overall, readers can follow the content without major confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally for a Spanish speaker in most places, but there are several spots where the phrasing feels slightly mechanical or unidiomatic: “El modelo en sí no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus discusiones.” and the use of quotation marks around «olvidado» could be streamlined. A more colloquial verb choice (“comienzas” instead of “partes”) would improve smoothness. Still, the overall fluency is acceptable.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: pre-entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL (aprendizaje en contexto). The terminology matches the level expected by a general audience, and no terms were omitted or mistranslated. The acronym ICL is kept as is, which is standard practice. No unnecessary paraphrasing was required.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational style, while adapting cultural references to a Spanish-speaking audience. The metaphor of a consultant and the explanation of memory are conveyed clearly. Slight adjustments in phrasing might enhance cultural resonance, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the French source is present; there are no omissions of key concepts or dialogue. The Spanish version maintains the dialogue format and includes every explanatory segment. Minor additions (e.g., clarifying that “ICL” stands for “aprendizaje en contexto”) help reader understanding without adding redundancy.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical ideas and conversational tone of the original French script. It demonstrates good terminology handling and maintains the core message. However, a few phrasing choices feel slightly unnatural or could be tightened, and one sentence contains a small grammatical glitch. With minor polishing, the Spanish version would read as smoothly and professionally as the source text. Overall, it’s a competent, accurate translation suitable for a general audience who are familiar with AI concepts in Spanish. 84/100 points are deserved based on the criteria above."
