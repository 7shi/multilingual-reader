    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly easy to follow and the sentence structures are clear. However, some terms such as “afianzamiento” (intended to mean “fine‑tuning”) may confuse readers who expect the more common expression “ajuste fino.” This minor slip reduces overall clarity slightly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for a Spanish‑speaking audience in most places, but there are occasional awkward choices. Phrases like “Ella olvida todo” (referring to the AI) sound slightly unnatural; “la IA olvida todo” would be smoother. The use of English loanwords such as “prompt” is acceptable, yet the mixture of “aprender en contexto” and “aprendizaje en contexto” shows inconsistency. Overall, fluency is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved, but key terms suffer from inaccuracies: “afianzamiento” instead of “ajuste fino” or “fine‑tuning,” “ancrage” rendered as “anclaje” but written “ancrage,” and “contextual adaptation” loosely translated as “adaptación contextual.” These inconsistencies could mislead readers. Consistency is otherwise reasonable.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the intent and purpose of the original. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is largely straightforward. However, the repeated use of English terms (e.g., ICL, prompt) may not feel native. The narrative flow remains true to the source, but a few expressions could be polished for a Spanish audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present. No critical information is omitted, and the translation does not add extraneous details. The structure stays concise and clear, and redundancy is well managed. The only potential issue is the mislabeling of technical terms, but the meaning remains understandable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is generally solid and conveys the main ideas accurately. Minor terminology inaccuracies and some slightly awkward phrasing reduce the overall polish. With a few adjustments—especially correcting key technical terms and smoothing out pronoun usage—the translation would reach a high level of quality for a native Spanish audience. It is functional and largely faithful, but not yet flawless in terminology and naturalness."
