  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to understand for native speakers, with clear explanations of technical concepts. Sentences are reasonably well structured, though a few long sentences could be broken up for better flow. Overall, readers can follow the dialogue and grasp the main ideas without much effort.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly most of the time, but some expressions feel slightly formal or unnatural, e.g., \"la IA no se ajusta constantemente\" instead of a more idiomatic phrasing. Punctuation is mostly correct, yet a few places could use more natural phrasing to match everyday Spanish usage.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"finetuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are appropriately rendered. The translation consistently uses the same terms throughout, and explanations are clear for a general audience. Minor inconsistencies (e.g., \"pre‑entrenamiento\" vs. \"preentrenamiento\") are present but do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the conversational tone and the structure of the original dialogue. Cultural references are kept generic, which works for a Spanish-speaking audience. However, certain idiomatic nuances from the French version could be better localized (e.g., more natural ways to express the idea of a \"consultant brillante\").",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original transcript is present. The translation includes the final sign‑off, and no significant content is omitted. Some explanatory clarifications are maintained, and redundancy is largely avoided.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and faithful to the original French script. It conveys the technical content clearly and maintains the dialogue’s flow. Minor improvements in natural phrasing and a few small formatting tweaks would elevate the text to a native‑level polish."
