  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version uses clear sentence structures that closely mirror the original French. Concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are introduced with straightforward explanations. Minor stylistic issues exist (e.g., repeated “Ella olvida todo”) but they do not impede understanding. Overall, readers can follow the dialogue without confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a Spanish speaker. Vocabulary choices are mostly appropriate, and the flow of the conversation is smooth. Small awkwardities appear, such as “se acuerda” (instead of the more common “recuerda”) and the use of “de estas informaciones” (should be singular). Despite these, the text sounds conversational and authentic.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: preentrenamiento, afinamiento/ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding. The translation consistently uses Spanish equivalents, though the switch between “afinamiento” and “ajuste fino” may confuse readers. Overall terminology is accurate and suitable for the target audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation considers Spanish cultural norms: the conversational tone, the use of second‑person formal address, and idiomatic expressions. The translation avoids literalism and localizes idioms where necessary. Cultural adaptation is appropriate, maintaining the original intent without unnecessary localization.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present, and no critical information is omitted. The translation stays faithful to the content and even adds a brief clarification in some places, without unnecessary repetition or verbosity.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is clear, accurate, and largely fluent. Minor linguistic choices could be improved, but the overall quality is high. It effectively conveys the technical concepts while maintaining a natural conversational flow for Spanish‑speaking listeners. A slight adjustment in terminology consistency would bring it to perfection. Overall, it is a strong translation that meets the intended purpose well."
