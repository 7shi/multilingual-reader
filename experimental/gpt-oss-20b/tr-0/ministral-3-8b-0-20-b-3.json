  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the clear, step‑by‑step structure of the original script, making it easy for readers to follow the concepts. Sentences are generally concise, though some run‑on sentences slightly reduce readability. Overall, the content is comprehensible to a broad audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally for native Spanish speakers. Most idiomatic expressions and phrasing are appropriate. Minor awkwardities appear in a few lines (e.g., \"para el proyecto actual\" instead of a more fluid phrasing), but these do not hinder overall fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", and \"ventana de contexto\" are correctly translated and consistently used. The term \"In‑Context Learning\" is kept in English, which is acceptable for a bilingual technical audience. The terminology is appropriate for the target readership level.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects cultural context, adapting expressions like \"aprender de memoria\" and using Spanish‑specific phrasing. It maintains the conversational tone of a podcast and effectively conveys the original intent without cultural missteps.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French original is present; no significant content is omitted. The translation preserves the dialogue flow and keeps the script concise while adding useful clarifications where needed. Redundancies are minimal.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully representing the original content while maintaining readability, naturalness, and appropriate terminology. Minor fluency tweaks could further polish the text, but the current version effectively communicates the intended concepts to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Overall, it scores 90 out of 100, reflecting strong translation fidelity and audience‑friendly language."
