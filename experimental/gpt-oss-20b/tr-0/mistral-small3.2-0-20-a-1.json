  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and easy to follow. Sentence structures are logical and most complex concepts are explained plainly. Minor awkwardness occurs in a few places (e.g., “Lo has entendido todo”), but overall the text is highly readable for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural overall, but there are a few minor grammatical and stylistic slips such as missing punctuation after “Lo has entendido todo”, inconsistent quotation marks, and the use of “afinamiento” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”. Vocabulary is contemporary and appropriate, but the overall flow could be tightened slightly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, IA, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, anclaje, memoria a corto plazo, memoria. The Spanish equivalents are accurate and familiar to the target audience, and term usage remains consistent throughout.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent and purpose of the original French dialogue are preserved. The translation adapts cultural references naturally (e.g., greeting with “Hola”), uses appropriate Spanish idioms (“como repasar para un examen”), and avoids unnecessary literalisms. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve localization, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No substantive content is omitted; all key points from the French source are present. The translation includes all explanations, analogies, and procedural details. Redundancies are minimal and the text remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is high quality, faithfully conveying the meaning, tone, and technical details of the original French text. Minor fluency adjustments would bring it to perfection, but it is already very readable and natural for Spanish speakers. The translator demonstrates good command of terminology, context, and style, ensuring a coherent and engaging final product."
