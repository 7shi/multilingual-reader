  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version retains the logical flow and most explanations in a clear, easily understandable manner. Sentences are mostly straightforward, though a few phrases (e.g., “Lo has entendido todo.”) feel slightly abrupt. Overall, readers can grasp the concepts without major confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for Spanish speakers, but a handful of constructions are slightly stilted or literal (e.g., “Lo has entendido todo.”, “Si quiero que tenga conocimiento de la misma información mañana”). The vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, yet occasional word choices could be smoother.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\". The parenthetical English term \"grounding\" is preserved as in the original, respecting its status as a specialized term. Overall terminology handling is excellent.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and maintains cultural relevance. Minor stylistic adjustments were made for clarity, but no meaning was lost or distorted. The text remains suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience familiar with tech podcasts.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant omissions are present. All dialogues, explanations, and examples from the source are retained. Minor rephrasings exist but do not affect the conveyed information, and redundancies are minimal.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation demonstrates a strong grasp of the source material, preserving technical accuracy and narrative flow. While a few phrases could be polished for smoother reading, the overall quality is high and the content is both clear and faithful to the original French version. Minor refinements would elevate the text to an impeccable standard, but as it stands it provides an accurate and accessible rendition for Spanish-speaking listeners of the podcast.\n\nTotal Score: 91/100"
