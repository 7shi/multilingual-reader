  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows a logical structure. Sentences are mostly clear, but a few awkward constructions (e.g., “una IA completamente nueva a la escuela”) and a typo (“Tella”) slightly hinder fluency. Overall, readers can grasp the content without much effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text often feels literal and contains some grammatical slips (“Has comprendido todo”, “Tella es la realidad”), inconsistent tense usage, and occasional awkward phrasing. Native speakers would notice these as unnatural. The overall flow is acceptable but not smooth.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly translated correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “memoria a corto plazo”. However, there is inconsistency in the term for fine‑tuning (“afianzamiento” vs “afinamiento”), and the Spanish word “afianzamiento” is uncommon in this context. The terminology remains comprehensible but could be more consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the podcast’s informal tone and conversational structure. Cultural references are largely preserved, though some expressions (e.g., “la IA completamente nueva a la escuela”) are literal rather than idiomatic. The adaptation is adequate but could be improved for naturalness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French transcript are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No essential information is omitted, and the translation stays close to the source length. Minor redundancies are minimal.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation faithfully reproduces the content and intent of the original French text, covering all technical concepts and maintaining the conversational style. However, it shows some linguistic and terminological inconsistencies that reduce its naturalness and could confuse native readers. With minor revisions—standardizing terminology, correcting typos, and smoothing some phrasing—the translation would reach a higher level of quality and readability. Overall, it is a competent and largely accurate translation that would serve a general audience well after a few polishings."
