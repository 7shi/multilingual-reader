  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable, with clear sentence structure and logical flow. However, there are a few problematic repetitions (e.g., the phrase \"Ella olvida todo\" appears twice) and some awkward phrasing (“Por lo tanto, es una memoria de uso único”). These small issues slightly hinder smooth reading, resulting in a score of 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely fluent but contains several grammatical slip‑ups: missing accents in \"¿Por qué\", incorrect inverted question marks, and an unintended English word \"Precisely\" that was left in the Spanish text. Word choices are mostly appropriate, but phrases such as \"tienes toda la razón\" and \"proporcionarle los documentos de información exactos\" feel slightly unnatural in this context. These factors lower the fluency to 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms like \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly rendered. Minor inconsistencies appear: \"AIC\" instead of the correct abbreviation \"ICL\", the word \"grounding\" is kept in English, and \"apoyar en\" should be \"se apoya en\". Overall, the terminology is adequate, earning 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The cultural adaptation is minimal but generally appropriate. The greeting uses \"bienvenida\" instead of the plural \"bienvenidos\", which does not match the dual hosts. Some expressions (e.g., \"Vejo\" instead of \"Veo\") are not idiomatic. However, the translation retains the informal tone of a podcast, so the score is 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Essential content from the original is present, with no major omissions. The repetitive line and the small typo \"balanza\" for \"equilibrio\" reduce precision, but the overall message is intact. The translation also adds a slight clarification on the role of memory features. Therefore, it receives 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the gist of the French dialogue and conveys the technical concepts clearly. However, several linguistic errors (missing accents, duplicated lines, wrong abbreviations) and slightly awkward phrasing detract from the overall quality. With some proofreading and minor adjustments to phrasing and terminology consistency, the translation could reach a higher level of polish and readability. Overall, it is a competent but not flawless translation, scoring 14/20 on average across the evaluated dimensions."
