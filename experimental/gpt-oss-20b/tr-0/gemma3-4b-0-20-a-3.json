  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the conversational flow of the original and uses simple, clear sentence structures. Phrases like \"La IA no ha 'olvidado' en el sentido humano del término; su espacio de trabajo temporal simplemente ha sido vaciado\" are understandable, though a bit wordy. Overall, readers can follow the content without confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the Spanish text reads naturally and would be understood by native speakers. Minor quirks such as \"Tech Brillo\" instead of keeping the original brand name and the slightly formal construction in a few sentences slightly reduce smoothness, but the overall tone is conversational and engaging.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly translated: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\", \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\", and \"Memoria\" for the new feature. The terminology is consistent throughout and appropriate for a general Spanish-speaking audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references (e.g., Spanish idiomatic expressions like \"imaginen que enviamos una IA totalmente nueva a la escuela\") and keeps the conversational style. The brand name is translated to \"Tech Brillo\", which is a literal adaptation; retaining the original could have preserved brand recognition, but the adaptation still conveys the intended meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogues, explanations, and examples from the original are present. No significant information is omitted. The content remains concise, and redundancy is avoided, resulting in a faithful rendering of the source text.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is highly accurate, readable, and fluent, with minor stylistic quirks. Terminology is handled well, and contextual adaptation is generally appropriate. The translation faithfully conveys the original intent while making it accessible to Spanish-speaking listeners. Overall, it is an excellent adaptation that could be used in a professional podcast setting with only minor refinements needed for brand consistency and slight naturalness tweaks. Overall score: 18.2/20.0"
