  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to read. Sentences are clear and follow a logical order, mirroring the French dialogue. Minor issues appear in longer sentences that could be split for better flow, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly natural for native Spanish speakers. However, there are a few awkward spots: the use of the French word “antisèche” instead of a Spanish equivalent, and some slightly literal phrasings such as “cuando abres una nueva ventana” which feels a bit literal. These do not hinder understanding but lower the overall smoothness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre-entrenamiento*, *ajuste*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto* (ICL), *ventana de contexto*, *memoria a corto plazo*, and *anclaje* are correctly rendered and consistently used throughout the text. The acronym ICL is preserved, which is acceptable. No major terminology errors were found.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references remain neutral and appropriate for a Spanish-speaking audience. The only notable adaptation issue is the untranslated French word “antisèche,” which detracts slightly from contextual appropriateness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue, explanations, and examples from the original French script are present. No information is omitted or incorrectly altered. The translation is concise and clear, avoiding unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, accurately conveying the original meaning while maintaining a natural Spanish style. Minor linguistic hiccups, such as the retention of the French word “antisèche” and some slightly literal phrasing, prevent it from achieving a perfect score. With slight refinements, it would be an excellent Spanish rendition of the podcast transcript."
