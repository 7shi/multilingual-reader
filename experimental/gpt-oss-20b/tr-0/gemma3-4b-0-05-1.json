    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is mostly easy to read, with most sentences following the original structure. However, a few sentences are incomplete or have misplaced punctuation (e.g., the stray quote and comma after \"encuentro\"), which can momentarily confuse a reader. Overall, the text is understandable but could be smoother.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds largely natural for a native Spanish speaker, but several awkward expressions slip through. Notably, \"aprendizaje en contexto es bachore\" uses a non‑existent word, and some verb forms (“solo le hemos proporcionado una esquela”) feel clunky. Minor punctuation errors further detract from flow. The vocabulary is contemporary but occasionally misapplied.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are translated correctly (\"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ajuste fino\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\"). However, the mis‑translation of “in‑context learning” as “bachore” and the generic use of “memoria” (instead of a more specific term like “memoria a corto plazo”) indicate inconsistent handling. Consequently, terminology fidelity is acceptable but not flawless.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The cultural adaptation is adequate; idiomatic references such as the consultant analogy translate well, and the overall intent of the dialogue remains clear. Some minor adjustments (e.g., better phrasing for “esquema” vs. “esquela”) would improve resonance with Spanish‑speaking audiences, but the core message is preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French original is present; no major content has been omitted. The only slight redundancy occurs with the repeated explanation of the memory feature, but this mirrors the original structure. No essential supplement is missing.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely faithful and conveys the original meaning, but it suffers from a handful of lexical and punctuation errors that reduce clarity and naturalness. With targeted corrections—particularly to the terminology and sentence completeness—the Spanish version would reach a high level of quality suitable for professional podcasts."
