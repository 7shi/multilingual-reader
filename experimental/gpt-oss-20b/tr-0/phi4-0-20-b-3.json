    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the overall sentence structure of the original dialogue, using clear and straightforward language. Phrases like \"El modelo experto en inglés…\" and \"aprenderá el francés a una velocidad increíble\" are easily understandable to a Spanish-speaking audience. The text flows logically from one idea to the next, and the dialogue format makes it easy to follow the conversation between Camille and Luc.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the sentences read naturally, but there are a few minor grammatical slip-ups that affect fluency. For example, \"la IA no se afinan\" should be \"la IA no se afinan\" (or \"la IA no se afinan\" in context) and \"El modelo experto en inglés…\" sometimes feels a bit literal. Despite these small issues, the overall tone is conversational and matches native Spanish podcast dialogue.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are translated accurately and consistently: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL → ALC). Acronyms are adapted to Spanish where appropriate, and explanations are provided when necessary (e.g., the difference between temporary knowledge and permanent skill). No significant terminology errors were found.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator maintains the original intent and tone, and culturally relevant expressions are used (e.g., referencing a consultant and training analogy). The Spanish version feels tailored to a Spanish-speaking audience, but some expressions could be slightly polished for idiomatic flair. Overall, the adaptation is effective and respectful of the target culture.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present: pre-training, fine-tuning, transfer learning, in-context learning, grounding, memory functions, and the final reflection on temporary versus permanent knowledge. No critical information was omitted, and redundancy was minimized. Minor wording choices may be redundant in places but do not detract from clarity.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is highly accurate and well-structured, preserving the conversational flow and technical content of the original French podcast transcript. While there are a few grammatical glitches and some slight awkward phrasing, these do not significantly impede understanding. The translation demonstrates strong readability, appropriate terminology usage, and faithful contextual adaptation, making it suitable for a native Spanish-speaking audience interested in AI concepts. Minor editorial polish could elevate the fluency to a fully natural level, but overall the work is of excellent quality and ready for publication or broadcast with minimal revisions. The overall quality of the translation scores 91 out of 100 points, reflecting its strong alignment with the original content and its suitability for the target readership. The main areas for improvement would be smoothing out small grammatical inconsistencies and ensuring absolute grammatical agreement in reflexive verbs, which would bring the fluency score even higher. Nevertheless, the translation accomplishes its purpose with clarity and professionalism."
