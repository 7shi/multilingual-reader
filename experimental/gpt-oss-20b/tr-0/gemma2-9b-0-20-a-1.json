  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, but the frequent use of the Portuguese‑derived word \"afinamento\" (instead of the Spanish \"ajuste fino\" or \"afinamiento\") and other awkward constructions disrupt the flow. Sentences are mostly logical, but some phrases feel stilted or unfinished (e.g., \"Se olvida de todo. Así que es una memoria de uso único.\"). Overall readability is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains several unnatural expressions and grammatical mistakes that impede naturalness. The use of \"afinamento\" and \"afinando\" is not Spanish. Some verb forms (e.g., \"Sería increíblemente ineficaz\") are correct, but overall the translation sounds somewhat mechanical and occasionally disjointed. Native speakers might find parts of the dialogue clunky.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" (translated as \"anclaje\") and \"Mémoire\" are mostly preserved, but the critical term \"fine‑tuning\" is incorrectly rendered as \"afinamento\". Terminology consistency suffers, especially between the English/French originals and the Spanish translation, leading to potential confusion.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and conversational style. Cultural references are minimal, and the script is adapted to a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, the use of Portuguese words detracts from a fully appropriate contextual adaptation. The dialogue remains engaging but occasionally feels less idiomatic.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No major content is omitted; the script conveys all points from the original. The translation sometimes repeats phrases for emphasis, but this does not significantly affect conciseness. Overall, the information is complete and clear enough for the target audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material but is undermined by consistent Portuguese interference in terminology and a few grammatical missteps. Readability is high, but fluency and technical consistency need improvement. The translator should replace \"afinamento\" with \"ajuste fino\" or \"afinamiento\" and refine some awkward phrasing to achieve a truly natural, high‑quality Spanish rendering. With those adjustments, the text would more effectively serve its intended audience while preserving the engaging conversational tone of the original French script."
