  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to read. Sentences are short, the dialogue format is preserved, and complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in a straightforward way. Minor repetitions and occasional literal phrasing slightly reduce the flow, but overall readers can follow the content without confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly natural and sounds like spoken Spanish. However, some expressions feel slightly literal or formal, e.g., \"El modelo en sí no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus conversaciones\" or \"Sería increíblemente ineficiente.\" These could be phrased more smoothly. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary, but a few phrases could be refined for native fluidity.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\" (grounding), and the ICL acronym. The terminology is consistent throughout the text, and when necessary, terms are explained in simple language. No major mistranslations or omissions of technical vocabulary.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the cultural and linguistic context of Spanish speakers. Dialogue tags are preserved, and the casual, conversational tone matches the original. The use of second‑person pronouns and everyday expressions aligns with the target audience. Some idiomatic expressions could be more localized, but overall the intent and purpose are effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French script is present. The script’s structure, speaker cues, and key points about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, and memory features are retained. No significant omissions or extraneous additions are evident. The translation remains concise while covering every major idea.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, accurately conveying the original’s meaning and technical content. Minor issues with natural phrasing and slight literalness do not detract significantly from comprehension. The translator has preserved the dialogue style and context, making the text accessible to native Spanish speakers. With a few refinements in fluency, the translation could reach an even higher standard of native readability and naturalness."
