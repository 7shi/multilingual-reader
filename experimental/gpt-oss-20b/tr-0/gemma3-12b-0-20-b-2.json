  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to read; the sentence structure follows the original and the concepts are clearly explained. Some long sentences could be split for better flow, but overall the text remains comprehensible to a native speaker. 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation uses natural Spanish, but a few expressions feel slightly mechanical or redundant – e.g. \"Lo olvida todo.\" or the question format \"¿Entonces, el conocimiento proveniente del ajuste fino persiste en todas las conversaciones, para siempre?\". Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, and the overall flow is smooth. 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL) and \"anclaje\" for grounding. No major terms are omitted or mistranslated, and the translation keeps the same level of specificity as the source. 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone. Cultural references are minimal, but the adaptation stays appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor adjustments could improve idiomatic expression (e.g., replacing “Lo olvida todo” with a more natural phrasing). Overall, the adaptation is effective. 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present in the Spanish text. No significant omissions or additions that distort meaning are detected. Minor repetitions are avoided, and the content is concise yet clear. 19/20.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, accurately conveying the technical concepts and conversational tone of the original. Minor fluency tweaks could further polish the text, but it is already suitable for native Spanish speakers. The balance between literal accuracy and natural expression is well maintained, resulting in a clear, faithful, and engaging translation. Overall, a solid 84/100 score across the six criteria reflects a professional and reliable translation effort. 84/100 points total."
