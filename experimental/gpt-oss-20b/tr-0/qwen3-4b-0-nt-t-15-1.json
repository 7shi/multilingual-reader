  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, but several errors—such as missing articles, awkward word choices, and leftover French phrases—slightly hinder comprehension. Overall, readers can follow the conversation but may need to infer meaning in a few spots.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several awkward or incorrect constructions: \"L'apprentissage\" left untranslated, \"porque\" instead of \"por qué\", misspellings like \"reaprender\" missing, and a literal but clunky phrasing in places. These affect the natural flow of the dialogue.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly correct, but key terms such as \"learning by transfer\" are partially untranslated, and repeated use of \"conocencias\" (should be \"conocimientos\") disrupts consistency. The terminology is functional but not consistently accurate.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and cultural tone of the podcast are preserved, though a few literal translations (e.g., \"una forma astuta\" instead of a more natural phrasing) slightly reduce adaptation quality.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present; only minor omissions like an unfinished line in the conversation and some French remnants appear, but no essential content is missing.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers the core message and follows the original structure, yet it is marred by residual French fragments, spelling mistakes, and some unnatural phrasing that compromise readability and professionalism. A revision focusing on these issues would significantly improve quality."
