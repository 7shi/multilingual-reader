  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally clear and logical, and most sentences follow a natural flow for Spanish speakers. The dialogue is easy to follow and complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL, grounding) are explained with analogies that mirror the original. Minor issues include occasional missing words or slightly awkward punctuation (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje.”). Overall, readers can grasp the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly in most places, using idiomatic Spanish and appropriate tense agreement. However, there are a few instances of unnatural phrasing and punctuation errors (e.g., commas after introductory phrases, “del bachotaje” instead of “del bachotaje” could be simplified to “del bachotaje” or “de bachotaje”). The vocabulary is contemporary and fits the target audience. The overall fluency is high but not perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated (preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding/anclaje). The choice of words matches common usage in Spanish technical discourse, and no terminology is omitted or mistranslated. The translation also maintains consistency across the text.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone. The dialogue is adapted to Spanish culture without altering meaning; expressions like “consultor temporal” and “experto permanente” resonate with Spanish-speaking audiences. Minor cultural nuances could be refined (e.g., using “tú” instead of “su” in some sentences), but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present: the explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory features, and the final question about temporary vs permanent expertise. No significant information was omitted, and the translation avoids redundancy while staying concise. Some minor phrasing issues (e.g., missing word after “Las con…”) do not affect the overall message.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the original content and technical concepts. While it contains a handful of minor grammatical and stylistic quirks, these do not impede understanding. The translation is clear, coherent, and appropriately adapted for a Spanish‑speaking audience, making it suitable for professional or general consumption alike. Minor polishing would bring it to near‑flawless readability and fluency, but the current version is already strong and useful in its context. The score of 84/100 reflects the overall excellence with room for slight refinement in phrasing and punctuation. Good job! ✅"
