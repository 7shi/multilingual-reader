  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable, especially for speakers familiar with the subject. Sentences are long but follow the same structure as the original, so readers can track the flow. Some parts are a bit awkward due to missing hyphens or unusual word order (e.g., \"preentrenamiento\" instead of \"pre‑entrenamiento\"), which slightly reduces readability.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several grammatical errors that interrupt the natural rhythm of the language: \"El IA\" instead of \"la IA\", missing hyphens, and the awkward phrase \"Aprendizaje en Contexto In‑Context\". Phrases like \"la IA no es constantemente refinada\" are unnatural. However, most sentences read smoothly enough for native speakers to grasp the meaning. A more careful copy‑editing would raise fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\". Minor inconsistencies appear (e.g., switching between \"IA\" and \"la IA\"), but overall the terminology matches the intended level of understanding. The translation does not introduce confusing synonyms or mistranslations.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original conversational tone and cultural references (e.g., consulting analogies). It could be further improved by adjusting a few expressions that feel literal or out of place in Spanish. Still, the content resonates with a Spanish‑speaking audience and respects the cultural background.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, short‑term memory, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. There are no significant omissions, and the translation keeps the dialogue structure intact. Minor punctuation errors do not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is good overall, successfully conveying the technical content and conversational flow. However, it would benefit from a careful proofread to fix grammatical slips and streamline some awkward phrasing. Once those adjustments are made, the text would read as natural and professional to native Spanish speakers in a tech context. The main strengths are faithful terminology usage and comprehensive coverage of the original material, while the main weaknesses lie in fluency and minor grammatical details. A final polish could bring the score up to the 20/20 range, but even as it stands it provides a clear and useful Spanish version of the original French dialogue. 17/20.  This score reflects strong overall quality, with a few notable but fixable issues in fluency and consistency."
