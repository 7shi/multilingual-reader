  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "Readability is very high. The text is structured in short, conversational sentences that mirror the original. Only a few minor tense inconsistencies (e.g., “Lee” instead of “Leemos”) and missing accents (e.g., “¿Porque”) slightly reduce clarity, giving it 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish rendering sounds natural overall. Some literal expressions such as “Lo has entendido todo” and occasional missing accents or punctuation make it feel slightly less smooth, resulting in 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly translated and consistently used: “pre-entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “grounding” → “anclaje”. The terminology matches the target audience’s level, earning 19/20.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue preserves the original intent, tone, and cultural nuances. Minor idiomatic adjustments could improve naturalness, but overall the adaptation is effective, giving 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All lines from the French source are present; no content is omitted, and redundancy is avoided. The translation is therefore fully complete, 20/20.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation accurately conveys the French original with clear, consistent terminology and a mostly natural flow. Minor grammatical errors and slightly awkward phrasing lower its fluency, but the text remains comprehensible and complete. It is a solid translation that would serve its audience well with only small refinements needed for perfect polish. Overall, the quality is excellent, and the translation is ready for publication with minimal editing. The overall score reflects a high-quality result with room for minor improvements in fluency and naturalness. Score: 92/100."
