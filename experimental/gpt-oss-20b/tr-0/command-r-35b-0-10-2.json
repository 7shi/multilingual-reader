  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the logical flow of the original. However, some phrases such as \"a la IA\" and \"informaciones necesarias\" feel slightly clunky, which may distract a native reader. The overall readability remains high, with clear explanations of complex concepts.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences read smoothly, but there are a few unnatural word choices and grammatical quirks: \"informaciones\" instead of \"información\", \"se le proporcionan las informaciones necesarias\" is awkward, and the repetition of \"a la IA\" is redundant. These issues lower the naturalness of the translation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", and \"Memoria\". The translation consistently uses Spanish equivalents and explains concepts where necessary, showing good handling of terminology.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original to a Spanish-speaking audience well, using culturally appropriate expressions such as \"consultor brillante\" and maintaining the conversational tone. Minor adjustments could improve idiomatic expression, but overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines from the original are present; no information is omitted. The translation keeps the content concise and clear, with no unnecessary repetition. The completeness score is high.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the meaning and tone of the original French script with minor issues in fluency and some word choices.
