  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally easy to understand for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Long sentences are broken in most places and key ideas are clearly stated. However, some phrases (e.g., *enviado una IA completamente nueva a la escuela para darle una cultura general*) feel slightly literal and could be smoother, slightly reducing overall readability.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is fluent overall but shows a few unnatural constructions: *en la escuela* (instead of *en una “escuela” de aprendizaje*), *para que se enfrente a* (could be *para que enfrente*), and occasional missing accents (*in‑context learning* rendered as *learning in context*). Vocabulary is contemporary and appropriate, but minor grammatical quirks affect the naturalness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL*, *anclaje*, *memoria*. The translator kept consistency and used Spanish equivalents. No major terminology errors are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and tone of the podcast are preserved. The translator kept the show title in French/Spanish hybrid, which is acceptable for a bilingual audience. Some cultural references were translated literally (e.g., *en la escuela*) but did not hinder understanding. A few idiomatic expressions could be improved for local nuance.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French version appears in the Spanish translation. No omissions or additions distort the meaning. The text remains concise while covering every point discussed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers a clear and largely faithful rendition of the original script. While readability and fluency could be slightly improved with more natural phrasing, the terminology and content accuracy are strong. It should serve the target audience well with minimal adjustments needed for idiomatic polish. Overall, a solid translation that balances technical accuracy with conversational tone, warranting a commendable score of 16/20 for overall quality. The evaluation reflects that the translation is ready for use with only minor refinements to polish natural language flow and cultural adaptation. The key strengths lie in its faithful representation of technical concepts and comprehensive preservation of information, making it highly effective for Spanish‑speaking listeners seeking to understand AI concepts through this podcast format. The overall score of 16/20 reflects the translation’s high quality while acknowledging the room for minor naturalization improvements. This balanced assessment guides future translators on where to focus: refine idiomatic expressions for smoother listener experience while preserving the technical precision achieved here.   "
