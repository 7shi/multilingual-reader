  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely comprehensible, with clear sentence structures and logical flow. Some minor issues arise from missing punctuation and slightly awkward phrasing, but the overall content remains easy to follow for native Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds reasonably natural, but several expressions feel forced or incorrect, such as “Entiende todo” used in places where a more appropriate form (“Lo entiendes” or “Entiendes todo”) would fit better. The vocabulary is contemporary, yet occasional word choices disrupt the smoothness of the dialogue.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: “preentrenamiento,” “afinar,” “aprendizaje por transferencia,” “ventana de contexto,” “aprendizaje en contexto,” “anclaje,” etc. The translations of acronyms (ICL) and concepts are faithful and well-explained, ensuring the target audience grasps the intended meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the original intent and conversational tone, appropriately localizing the dialogue for Spanish listeners. Cultural references are minimal, but the adaptation maintains the humor and educational emphasis. Minor adjustments could improve readability in specific sections.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present in the Spanish translation, including explanations of pretraining, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning. No significant omissions were identified, and the information remains concise without unnecessary redundancy.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material and technical concepts. While most of the content is accurately rendered, a few linguistic nuances and word choices hinder perfect fluency. The overall quality is high, with minor improvements needed to polish naturalness and ensure consistency in phrasing."
