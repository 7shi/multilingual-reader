  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to read and follows the original dialogue structure. Sentence boundaries are clear and the conversational tone is preserved. However, a few grammatical slips (e.g., “Entendiste todo” instead of “Lo entendiste todo”) and some missing accents (“uso único”) slightly hamper flow. Overall, the audience can understand the content without major confusion.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds fairly natural for a Spanish-speaking listener, but several spots feel awkward or too literal. Expressions like “Entendiste todo”, “¡Olvida todo! Por lo tanto,” and the repeated exclamation marks can feel stilted. The inclusion of the English term “prompt” is understandable but could be replaced with a Spanish equivalent for smoother reading. Fluency is acceptable but not perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinación”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “anclaje”, “ventana de contexto”. The translation keeps the specialized vocabulary clear and understandable. Minor improvements could be made for “prompt” and “grounding”, but overall the terminology is accurate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the friendly, conversational style of the original French podcast. Cultural adaptation is evident in the opening greeting and the use of Spanish idioms (e.g., “montar en bicicleta”). Some phrasing, however, feels a bit literal and could be further localized to improve relatability. The overall intent and tone are preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present. No significant information is omitted, and supplementary explanations are adequate (e.g., clarifying “grounding” as “anclaje”). The only minor loss is a small nuance in the line about “apprendre à faire du vélo” which is slightly re‑phrased but still conveys the idea. Redundancy is minimal and the text stays concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is clear, technically accurate, and largely faithful to the original French dialogue. It effectively conveys the concepts and conversational tone. Some grammatical slips and slightly awkward phrasing reduce the polish of the text. With minor refinements—especially smoothing out naturalness and correcting minor errors—the translation would reach a higher standard of quality. Overall, it is a competent and communicative translation suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience interested in AI fundamentals. 16/20."
