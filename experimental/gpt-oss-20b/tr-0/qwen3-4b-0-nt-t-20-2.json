    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and retains the conversational flow of the original. Sentence structures are mostly clear, though some long sentences could be split for better readability. Complex concepts such as pre‑training and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a general audience would understand. Minor issues with punctuation and spacing slightly affect readability but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds fairly natural to native speakers. Common Spanish expressions such as \"un recién licenciado\" and \"ventana de contexto\" are used appropriately. However, a few awkward phrasing (e.g., \"un sistema más inteligente para recordar el contexto anterior\") and inconsistent use of hyphens in technical terms (preentrenamiento vs pre‑entrenamiento) reduce the overall smoothness. The overall tone is conversational, matching the podcast style.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled accurately: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", and \"anclaje\" are correctly rendered. Consistency is maintained throughout. The only minor issue is the lack of a hyphen in \"preentrenamiento\" which is common but optional; otherwise terminology is spot‑on.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the intent and casual tone of the original French transcript while adapting idiomatic expressions for Spanish listeners (e.g., \"un recién licenciado\" instead of a literal translation). Cultural references are minimal, but the adaptation maintains relevance for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Minor adjustments could improve localization (e.g., using \"ajuste fino\" instead of \"afinamiento\"), but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the consultant versus permanent expert analogy. No essential information is omitted, and the translation does not add extraneous content. Redundancies are minimal and the dialogue remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation demonstrates strong fidelity to the source text, maintaining its conversational tone, key technical concepts, and logical flow. While a few minor linguistic refinements could improve naturalness and consistency (especially with hyphenation and some phrasing), the translation is clear, accurate, and culturally adapted. It effectively communicates the intended message to a Spanish‑speaking audience."
