  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable for a native speaker. Sentences are mostly coherent, but a few long constructions (e.g., “La IA no ha «olvidado» en el sentido humano del término; simplemente su espacio de trabajo temporal ha sido vaciado.”) could be simplified for smoother reading. Overall readability is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is fluent in most places and captures the intended tone. However, some expressions feel slightly literal or awkward: the use of “una astuta forma” instead of “una astuta” or “prompt” left untranslated could be improved. These small quirks lower the overall fluency score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly – “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “ventana de contexto” – and are consistent throughout. The word “prompt” remains in English, which is acceptable in technical contexts but could be replaced by a Spanish equivalent (“instrucción” or “solicitud”). This gives a solid but not perfect score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and style, using culturally appropriate greetings (“Hola”) and idioms. The adaptation is faithful, but a few expressions are rendered too literally (e.g., “¿Es por lo tanto una astucia?”), which slightly reduces the naturalness. Overall, the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text covers almost all content of the original, including explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, and memory features. Minor phrasing differences do not lead to omissions. The only slight concern is the repetition of “su” referring to the system, which could be clarified. The content is complete and concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality: it preserves the meaning, technical accuracy, and overall tone of the original French script. Minor issues with fluency and a few untranslated English terms could be refined, but they do not significantly hinder comprehension. The translator demonstrates a strong grasp of both languages and technical concepts, delivering a clear and engaging final product for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Overall, it’s an excellent translation suitable for a professional podcast audience with a solid technical background. The final score reflects the solid performance while acknowledging small areas for improvement. 17/20."
