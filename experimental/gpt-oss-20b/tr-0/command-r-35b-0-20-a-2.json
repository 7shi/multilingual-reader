    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely comprehensible and follows the original dialogue structure. Minor syntactic slips (e.g., “pódcast” instead of “podcast”, “develar” instead of “desvelar”) do not impede understanding, but they slightly interrupt the flow. The use of simple sentence constructions and clear pronoun references keeps the dialogue easy to follow for a general audience. Therefore, readability is solid but not perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains a handful of unnatural or slightly archaic expressions, such as “pódcast”, “develar”, and the interjection “Lo han entendido todo.” The word “prompt” is carried over without adaptation, which feels out of place in Spanish. Additionally, some sentences have minor grammatical errors (“¿Porque” → “¿Por qué”, “Las conocimientos” → “Los conocimientos”). These issues reduce the overall naturalness of the text, warranting a moderate score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved (pre-entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, ICL, grounding) and remain understandable. The translation uses a mix of original English loanwords (“prompt”) and Spanish equivalents, which could be confusing for non‑technical listeners but is generally acceptable. The terminology is consistent throughout, though some phrases like “bachillerato” for “bachotage” could be clarified. Overall, terminology is appropriate but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the informal tone and conversational dynamics of the original French podcast. Cultural references are minimal, but the Spanish version does not fully exploit local idioms or expressions that could make it more engaging. The adaptation is competent, but some choices (e.g., “develar” instead of “desvelar”) slightly compromise the natural feel. The intent of the original is preserved, so the score reflects a solid adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No substantive content from the original is omitted. The translation faithfully reproduces all key points, including the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. Minor errors do not lead to loss of meaning. Thus the translation is complete and concise, justifying a high score.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the main ideas and dialogue structure of the French original. While readability and terminology are strong, some fluency issues—such as occasional awkward phrasing, literal loanword usage, and a few grammatical slips—reduce the naturalness of the text. With minor revisions, the translation would read more smoothly and align more closely with contemporary Spanish usage. Nonetheless, it serves its purpose of conveying the technical concepts to a Spanish‑speaking audience effectively, making it a competent, though not perfect, adaptation. The overall quality is solid and would be suitable for a podcast transcript with slight polishing."
