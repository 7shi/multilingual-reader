    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, but the presence of intermingled French phrases and occasional grammar slips (e.g., *telle est la réalité*, *tiene como objetivo*) disrupts the flow. Readers can follow the overall story but are forced to pause and translate the stray French segments. A score of 12/20 reflects that the core ideas are still conveyed, though clarity suffers due to these interruptions.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation exhibits several awkward constructions and lexical errors (e.g., *simplemente aprendes los palabras*, *una conocimiento temporal*). The mixing of languages makes the text feel fragmented and unnatural to a native Spanish reader. The overall fluency is therefore limited, warranting a score of 10/20.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as *pre-entrenamiento*, *fine-tuning*, *in-context learning* are present, but the term *grounding* remains untranslated (*ancrage*), and the word *ancrage* is kept in French in some places. Consistency is compromised, and some terminology could be clarified for a general audience. Score 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent of the original podcast script is largely preserved, but the frequent insertion of French phrases and the lack of Spanish idiomatic expressions reduce cultural adaptation. The translator also added a stray interjection (*¿En otras palabras?*) that does not appear in the source. Consequently, the contextual adaptation earns a 10/20.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is retained, including the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, and memory mechanisms. Minor omissions (e.g., the precise French phrasing of the last lines) and the accidental insertion of an additional phrase do not substantially affect overall comprehension. A score of 14/20 is appropriate.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the subject matter but suffers from several technical and stylistic issues. The intermixing of French and Spanish breaks the reader’s immersion, and occasional grammatical mistakes diminish readability. While the key concepts are present and mostly correct, the translation would benefit from a full linguistic cleanup and consistency checks. The resulting quality is moderate rather than high."
