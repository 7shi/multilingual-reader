  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version maintains the logical flow of the original dialogue and explains complex concepts in a way that a general audience can follow. Some sentences are slightly verbose, but overall the structure is clear and easy to understand.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly for native speakers. Minor awkwardness occurs in a few phrases such as \"una forma astucia de aprendizaje\" (better: \"una forma astuta\") and \"una libreta de apuntes\" (could be \"una referencia\"), but these do not impede comprehension. Vocabulary is contemporary and appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"anclaje\", \"memoria\". The translation keeps consistency across the text. A few terms like \"grounding\" are rendered as \"anclaje\", which is acceptable in this context, though \"fundamentación\" could also be used. Overall terminology is accurate and understandable.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references well, using Spanish idiomatic expressions such as \"¡Hasta pronto!\" and avoiding overly literal French phrases. The content is tailored to Spanish-speaking listeners without altering the original intent. Some expressions could be slightly more natural, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue from the original French script is present in the Spanish version. No critical information is omitted, and the speaker labels remain clear. Redundancy is minimal, and the translation keeps the content concise while preserving meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, delivering clear and natural Spanish while preserving technical accuracy and contextual nuance. Minor stylistic refinements could improve fluency, but the text remains easily comprehensible for the target audience and faithfully represents the original dialogue."
