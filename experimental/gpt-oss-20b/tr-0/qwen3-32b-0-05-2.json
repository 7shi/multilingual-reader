  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version keeps the overall structure of the French script and most sentences are easy to follow. However, a few awkward wordings (“en la IA”, “el proceso llamado el …”) and some long sentences slightly reduce clarity. Overall, readers can understand the content but would benefit from smoother phrasing.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds fairly natural, but there are several minor grammatical slips and stylistic choices that feel slightly off for native Spanish speakers. For example, “el proceso llamado el « pre‑entrenamiento »” should omit the second ‘el’, and “se ha vaciado su espacio de trabajo temporal” is a clunky translation of “its temporary workspace has been cleared.” Despite these, the text remains largely fluent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely accurate (“pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “grounding” translated as “anclaje”) and consistently applied. Some terms could be further clarified for a general audience (e.g., explaining ICL). Overall, terminology handling is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the conversational tone of the original podcast script and respects the target audience’s cultural context. Minor adjustments (e.g., removing unnecessary formalities) would improve cultural resonance, but the overall intent is effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present in the Spanish version: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory features, and the analogy with a consultant. No substantive omissions or duplications are detected.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is clear and generally accurate, capturing the technical concepts and conversational style of the original. Minor stylistic and grammatical refinements would elevate the text to a higher level of polish, but it is functionally sound for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
