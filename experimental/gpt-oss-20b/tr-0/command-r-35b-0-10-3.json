    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are short and logical, and the main ideas are conveyed in a straightforward way. A few phrases (e.g., \"Lo han comprendido todo\") feel slightly unnatural, but overall the text is comprehensible to a native Spanish speaker. Score: 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds largely natural and smooth. Most word choices are appropriate, and the rhythm of the sentences is correct. Some minor awkwardities (e.g., \"una ventana de discusión\" instead of \"una ventana de conversación\") slightly reduce fluency, but these do not impede understanding. Score: 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\", and \"memoria\" are translated correctly and consistently. No significant misinterpretations or omissions. Score: 19/20.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation to Spanish cultural context is good. Expressions are tailored to Spanish-speaking audiences, and culturally specific references are handled appropriately. Minor room for improvement in idiomatic phrasing. Score: 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French text are present in the Spanish version. No essential information is omitted, and the dialogue structure is preserved. Minor variations in phrasing do not affect meaning. Score: 19/20.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is overall strong, faithfully preserving the meaning, tone, and structure of the original French dialogue. It is largely readable and fluent, with accurate technical terminology and proper contextual adaptation. A few minor phrasing issues slightly reduce naturalness, but the translation remains clear and comprehensive. The overall quality is high, suitable for a native Spanish audience listening to a podcast about AI. The average score is 18.2/20, reflecting a very good translation with only small areas for refinement. The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of both the source material and the target language nuances, making it an effective and engaging adaptation for Spanish-speaking listeners."
