  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely comprehensible and follows a logical sentence structure. The dialogue format is preserved, and explanations of technical concepts are clear. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., \"Cuando abres una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío\") slightly reduce readability, but overall the target audience can understand the content without confusion.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for most native speakers. However, some sentences feel a bit clunky, such as \"Cuando abres una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío\" and the overly long clause in \"Cuando comienzas una nueva conversación…\". Word choices are generally appropriate, but a few instances of literal phrasing (e.g., \"apropiación\" instead of \"ajuste fino\") make the text feel slightly formal.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje. The translation avoids ambiguous wording and provides contextual explanations where needed. The occasional mix‑up of gender for IA (feminine) is a minor issue but does not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original tone and conversational style, adapting idioms where appropriate (e.g., \"¿Necesito un consultor temporal o un experto permanente?\"). Cultural references are minimal, and the dialogue remains relatable for Spanish-speaking listeners. Slightly more natural phrasing could improve the feel, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present in the Spanish version. No significant omissions or distortions occur. The translation includes the same examples and analogies, and the speaker roles are clearly identified. Redundancy is minimal, and the content stays concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation preserves the dialogue’s intent, technical clarity, and overall structure. While a few grammatical and stylistic refinements would polish the text further, it remains an accurate and accessible rendering for Spanish-speaking audiences. The translation is well‑executed and suitable for a podcast setting, with a few areas for minor improvement in fluency and phrasing. The overall quality is strong, reflecting a solid understanding of both the source material and the target language nuances. The final score is 82 out of 100, indicating a high‑quality translation with room for fine‑tuning."
