    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text follows a logical order and most of the ideas are understandable for a native reader. However, several grammatical slips and awkward phrasing (e.g., \"la IA no se refina\" instead of \"la IA no se afina\", \"la IA no ha ‘olvidado’\" instead of \"la IA no ha olvidado\", “le han dado una antiespia”) interrupt the flow and may require a second reading to grasp the intended meaning. The overall readability is acceptable but not seamless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation uses a mix of formal and informal pronouns (usted/tú) inconsistently, which feels unnatural. Some word choices sound literal and not idiomatic (e.g., \"antiespia\", \"refina\" for AI). Punctuation and article usage also contain mistakes (“Hola y bienvenido en” should be “a”). These issues reduce the overall smoothness of the text, though the majority of sentences still read like standard Spanish.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\". The consistency is good, but minor mismatches exist (e.g., using \"Memoria\" for a feature that is still a type of context memory). The terminology is appropriate for a Spanish-speaking audience and explanations are clear when needed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the content to Spanish-speaking listeners, but there are some inconsistencies with cultural references. For instance, the podcast name changes from \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Tech Destello\" in the body but reverts to the original name at the end, breaking consistency. Also, the phrase \"Hola y bienvenido en\" is slightly off; it should be \"a\". These errors slightly hinder the contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential points from the original French script are present: pre-training, fine-tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory feature, and the consultant analogy. No critical information is omitted. Minor redundancies (e.g., repeated use of \"la IA no se refina\") are present, but overall the translation remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely faithful to the source text and conveys the key concepts effectively. However, it suffers from several grammatical errors, inconsistent pronoun usage, and a few awkward word choices that detract from naturalness. Minor adjustments—especially in article use, pronoun consistency, and fixing a few literal translations—would elevate the quality to a near-native level. The script is comprehensible for a Spanish-speaking audience, but polish is needed for a professional release. The final score reflects a good but improvable translation: 15/20 points overall. Good job on the core content; just tidy up the language for a smoother listening experience."
