    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely clear and follows the original structure. Sentences are generally easy to parse, and the metaphorical language (e.g., “una joven recién graduada”) is understandable for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Minor awkwardness appears in phrases such as *‘una IA completamente nueva a la escuela’* and in the repeated use of *AIC* instead of the standard *ICL*. Overall, the reader can grasp the content without significant effort.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly for most parts, using contemporary vocabulary and appropriate gender agreement. However, there are small syntactic and punctuation issues: inconsistent capitalization of *AIC*, the misspelling *¿Porque* (missing accent), and slightly clunky expressions like *‘proporcionarle los documentos de información exactos’*. These reduce naturalness marginally.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, and *aprendizaje en contexto* are correctly translated. The abbreviation *AIC* is introduced but never used again, leading to confusion with *ICL*. Also, *‘Aprendizaje In-Contexto’* mixes English and Spanish in a non‑standard way. Consistency and standardization would improve this area.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references well (e.g., the consultant analogy) and retains the friendly, conversational tone of the original podcast. Some phrases could be slightly more idiomatic (e.g., *‘una IA completamente nueva a la escuela’*), but the overall intent and humor are preserved for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present in the Spanish version. No essential details were omitted, and the dialogue flow remains intact. Minor redundancies exist, but they do not compromise clarity. The translator added a brief clarifying note about the *'AIC'* abbreviation, which is helpful for readers unfamiliar with the term.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and largely faithful to the source. It effectively conveys the content and maintains the podcast’s approachable tone. Improvements could focus on standardizing terminology, correcting minor orthographic errors, and polishing a few slightly awkward constructions to enhance naturalness for native Spanish readers. Overall, the work is suitable for a general audience with a basic understanding of AI concepts and would benefit from a final copy‑editing pass to resolve the noted issues, making it a polished, professional Spanish adaptation of the French original.  The overall quality of the translation is strong, with an average score of 17 out of 20 points, reflecting a solid performance that could be further refined for absolute perfection in fluency and consistency."
