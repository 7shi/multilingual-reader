    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely comprehensible and follows a logical sentence structure that mirrors the original. The dialogue format is preserved and the concepts are explained in a way that a Spanish‑speaking audience can easily follow. Minor issues such as a slightly awkward phrasing in the sentence “El aprendizaje en contexto es memorización para examen” detract from perfect readability, but overall the message remains clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for native Spanish speakers, with most sentences sounding natural. There are a few unnatural constructions: “El aprendizaje en contexto es memorización para examen” feels a bit literal and could be phrased more idiomatically. The use of “afinamiento” for fine‑tuning is understandable, though “ajuste fino” or “fine‑tuning” would be more common. The abrupt appearance of the acronym “AIC” is a noticeable slip. Overall, the fluency is high but not perfect.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto* and *aprendizaje en contexto* are correctly translated and consistently used. The choice of *afinamiento* for fine‑tuning is acceptable, though a more precise term (*ajuste fino* or *fine‑tuning*) could improve consistency. The introduction of the acronym “AIC” is incorrect and may confuse readers. The translator generally keeps the original terminology intact and adds clarifications where necessary.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The cultural adaptation is generally good; the Spanish version uses familiar phrasing and avoids overly literal translations. The translation maintains the conversational tone of the podcast. Some expressions, however, could be more idiomatic—for example, “El aprendizaje en contexto es memorización para examen” could be rendered as “El aprendizaje en contexto equivale a estudiar para un examen.” The mislabeling of the acronym as “AIC” slightly undermines contextual clarity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present in the Spanish translation. There are no major omissions; the dialogue flow, explanations, and examples remain intact. The added contextual notes (e.g., the explanation of memory functions) are faithful to the original intent. Redundancies are minimal, and the content is concise yet clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is overall strong, capturing the original meaning, tone, and structure. Minor linguistic refinements—particularly regarding phrasing and terminology consistency—would bring it to an almost flawless level. The unintended acronym “AIC” is a small but noticeable error that could mislead readers. Nevertheless, the piece remains accessible and informative for a Spanish‑speaking audience and effectively conveys the nuances of AI training concepts discussed in the original French script. The overall score reflects a high quality translation with room for minor polish.  The translation is well‑executed, with only slight stylistic and terminological adjustments needed for maximum clarity and accuracy.  The total average score is 17/20, indicating a strong performance overall.  The key strengths lie in readability and information completeness, while fluency and terminology offer modest improvement opportunities.  The translation is suitable for publication with minimal edits.  **Score: 17/20**."
