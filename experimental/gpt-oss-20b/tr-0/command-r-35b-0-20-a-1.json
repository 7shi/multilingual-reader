  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version largely preserves the logical flow of the original French dialogue, and the sentences are easy to follow for a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, occasional literal phrasing (e.g., *‘Los olvida todo’* instead of *‘Lo olvida todo’*) and the use of quotation marks around *bachillerato* create minor distractions. Overall, the text is comprehensible but could benefit from smoothing some of the more awkward constructions.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly fluent, but there are several instances where the language feels a bit stilted or mixes English and Spanish (*‘Cuando begins una nueva conversación’*). Some expressions that work in French (e.g., *‘le consulting’* translated as *‘consultor brillante’*) feel forced. The vocabulary is generally appropriate, but a few choices (e.g., *‘bachillerato’* as a metaphor) are slightly unnatural for native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled fairly well: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *grounding* (anclaje) and *Memoria* are consistent with common usage. The translation does not lose any essential technical nuance, and the terms are aligned with the level expected from a general audience. Minor clarifications could improve the readability of some terms, but overall the terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural adaptation is adequate, though some idiomatic choices (e.g., *‘consultor brillante’*) feel slightly literal. The overall message is conveyed accurately, and the Spanish version is accessible to the target audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, and memory features are covered. There is no noticeable omission, and the translation avoids excessive redundancy while maintaining clarity.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the main ideas of the original French dialogue and is mostly readable and technically accurate. However, a few linguistic inaccuracies and unnatural phrasing slightly detract from the overall fluency. With minor adjustments to word choice and syntax, the translation would be more polished and feel entirely native."
