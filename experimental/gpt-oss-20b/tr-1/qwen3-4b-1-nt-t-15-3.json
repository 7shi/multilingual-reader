    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely understandable, with clear explanations of complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning. The sentence structure is mostly logical, but some sentences are awkwardly constructed (e.g., “La IA no se afinan constantemente”) and could be simplified for easier comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds generally smooth, but there are several grammatical errors (missing articles, incorrect verb agreement) and unnatural expressions (e.g., “un bacheo” for *bachotage*). The flow could be improved by adjusting word order and pronoun usage.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly correctly rendered – *preentrenamiento*, *afinado*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *anclaje*, *Memoria*. Minor issues include the non‑standard *bacheo* and plural usage of *informaciones*. Overall, terminology is accurate and consistent.",

    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, with appropriate cultural adaptation for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The literal style is acceptable for a podcast script, though some idiomatic phrasing could be localized more naturally.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French source are present; no essential information has been omitted. The dialogue flows from one segment to the next, maintaining conciseness while avoiding unnecessary repetition.",
