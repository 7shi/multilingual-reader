    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely understandable, but a number of sentences are awkward or confusing (e.g., *El aprendizaje en contexto, es del aplastar*). Phrases such as *por tanto* and *la ventana de contexto* help the flow, yet the literal translation of some idioms breaks the reader’s comprehension. 15/20.",

    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions feel stilted or overly literal (*grounding* rendered as *anclage* or *groundity*). The repetition of *aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)* is redundant. Word choices are mostly correct, but the overall rhythm suffers, resulting in a fluency score of 13/20.",

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia* and *ventana de contexto* are correctly rendered. However, *grounding* was mistranslated as *anclage* and *ICL* is not consistently italicised. Minor terminology inconsistencies lead to a score of 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and conversational tone, but some cultural nuances (e.g., *por tanto* versus *de hecho*) could be smoother. The occasional literal rendering of idioms reduces contextual adaptation, yielding 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The bulk of the content is preserved, yet the explanation of *learning in context* is incorrectly translated (*es del aplastar*), and a few explanatory parenthetical remarks are missing. This loss of nuance results in a 15/20 score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version is intelligible and largely faithful to the original, but it contains several awkward phrasings, a few mistranslations of key technical terms, and a notable error in the description of in‑context learning. These issues compromise readability and fluency. With minor revisions—especially correcting the *grounding* translation, smoothing the repeated phrases, and fixing the *aprender* sentence—the text could reach a high quality level. As it stands, the translation is acceptable for general understanding but would benefit from editing for naturalness and precision in technical language. Overall, a solid attempt with room for improvement in linguistic polish and exactness of terminology. "
