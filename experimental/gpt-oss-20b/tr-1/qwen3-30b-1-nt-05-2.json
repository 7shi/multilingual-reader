  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but several sentences suffer from grammatical errors (e.g., \"Han entendido todo\", \"partes de un contexto vacío\") that can confuse readers. Word order is often correct, yet occasional awkward phrasing makes some passages harder to follow. The overall structure keeps the dialogue flow, so the readability score is 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many expressions are literal translations and feel stilted (e.g., \"refinada\", \"ajuste fino\" vs \"afinamiento\"). Phrases like \"Se puede decir eso\" are acceptable, but others are grammatically wrong or unnatural, reducing the smoothness for a native Spanish speaker. The fluency score is 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are correctly rendered. However, inconsistency in the term for fine‑tuning (\"ajuste fino\" vs \"afinamiento\") and the occasional use of English words (prompt) detracts from consistency. Overall terminology handling is solid, earning 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references are minimal and appropriately translated. Minor stylistic adjustments could improve naturalness, but the adaptation is largely effective, giving 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French source are present, and no essential information is omitted. Minor redundancies exist but do not significantly impede clarity. Thus the completeness score is 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main ideas and dialogue structure accurately, but suffers from a number of grammatical mistakes and terminology inconsistencies that reduce readability and fluency. With some proofreading and standardization of terms, it could reach a high‑quality level for a native Spanish audience. Overall, it is a solid but imperfect translation, scoring roughly 15/20 overall. "
