    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly easy to read and the sentence structure follows a logical order that mirrors the original. However, a few short sentences such as “Ustedes han comprendido todo” feel abrupt and could be smoothed out, and the frequent switches between formal and informal pronouns (ustedes vs tú) can momentarily confuse the reader. Overall, the level of comprehension is high but a little polishing would make it flow more naturally.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The majority of the translation sounds natural for a Spanish-speaking audience, using contemporary vocabulary. Nevertheless, some phrases are slightly awkward: “Ustedes han comprendido todo” is not the most idiomatic way to convey understanding, and the use of “usted”/“tú” alternates inconsistently. There are also minor punctuation issues, such as missing quotation marks around “ventana de contexto”. These small slips lower fluency marginally.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly—pre-entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, grounding—matching common Spanish parlance. The acronyms are explained, and no terminology is omitted. Consistency is good, although the translation sometimes uses “ajuste fino” while the original also uses “fine-tuning” directly, but that is acceptable. No major errors.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural nuances are largely respected; the informal chat format is kept. However, the shift between formal and informal pronouns (ustedes, usted, tú) could be standardized to better match a single target audience. Overall, the adaptation is effective with minor room for improvement.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the key points from the French original are present: pre-training, fine-tuning, transfer learning, context window, ICL, grounding, memory features. No essential content was omitted, and the explanation of how the memory feature works is adequately expanded. The translation remains concise and does not add unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the meaning of the original French text with good accuracy and clear explanations of technical concepts. It is mostly fluent, though a few phrasing choices feel slightly formal or abrupt. Terminology is well-handled and consistent. The adaptation respects the conversational tone, with a minor inconsistency in pronoun usage. The translation is largely complete and understandable, making it suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience interested in AI."
