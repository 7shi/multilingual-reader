  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, with most sentences flowing logically and the use of analogies helping to explain complex concepts. However, a few awkward constructions (e.g., “la IA se apoya en fundamentos extremadamente sólidos”) and occasional missing articles slightly reduce clarity. Overall, the text is readable for a general audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly sounds natural, but there are a few grammatical slips such as “Esta función de memorización son” (should be “es”) and inconsistent hyphenation of terms like “pre-entrenamiento”/“preentrenamiento”. These errors interrupt the smoothness for a native speaker, lowering the fluency score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: pre-entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje. The meaning is preserved and the terms are appropriate for Spanish-speaking readers. Minor omissions of the English acronym ICL are acceptable as the concept is rendered in Spanish. Terminology handling is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone, adapting greetings appropriately (“Buenos días”). Cultural references are minimal, but the Spanish version respects local norms and punctuation. Overall, contextual adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No substantive content is omitted; the dialogue’s flow, explanations, and examples remain intact. Some explanatory details from the French original (e.g., the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge) are preserved, and redundant sections are not added. Thus the translation is complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the original message well and is generally readable, though a few grammatical errors and slightly unnatural phrasing affect fluency. Terminology and contextual adaptation are handled competently, and the content remains complete. With minor polishing, the translation would reach a higher standard of naturalness."
