  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally readable, but the presence of stray English fragments (e.g., \"Such is the reality of ICL.\") and repeated tags such as \"Traducción al español:\" interrupts the flow. Sentences are sometimes truncated or abruptly cut, making the text harder to follow. 12/20 reflects acceptable comprehension but noticeable distractions.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most of the Spanish vocabulary is correct, the translation contains several grammatical oddities: missing articles, inconsistent verb forms, and awkward literalisms (e.g., \"aprende en contexto\" instead of \"aprendizaje en contexto\"). The inserted English lines break the natural rhythm of the dialogue. 10/20 indicates that the text is understandable but not entirely natural to native Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", and \"ventana de contexto\" are generally used correctly. However, inconsistencies appear: \"In-Context Learning\" is sometimes rendered as \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and other times as \"aprender en contexto\". The term \"grounding\" is translated as \"anclaje\", which is appropriate. Overall, terminology is acceptable but could be more consistent. 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the core intent of the original French podcast script and uses culturally neutral language suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience. Some idiomatic expressions from French are not fully adapted (e.g., \"apprentissage en contexte\" is used literally rather than a more natural Spanish equivalent). Nevertheless, the adaptation is largely faithful. 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the information from the original is present, but some content is lost or garbled: residual English fragments, misplaced quotation marks, and the abrupt appearance of tags. These issues result in small omissions of nuance. 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the gist of the French script but is undermined by extraneous English snippets, markup tags, and occasional grammatical awkwardness. With careful editing to remove the markers, harmonize terminology, and polish the flow, it could become a clear, natural Spanish rendition of the podcast episode.\n\nScore: 13/20"
