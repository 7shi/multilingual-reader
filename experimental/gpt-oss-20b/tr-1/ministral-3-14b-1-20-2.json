  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly easy to follow, and the structure mirrors the original dialogue. However, several sentences contain awkward wording or small grammatical errors that could hinder smooth comprehension for native speakers, especially in more complex explanatory parts. Nonetheless, the overall narrative flow remains clear.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version reads well overall, but there are noticeable instances of unnatural phrasing and minor grammatical mistakes. Examples include \"Le hace lectura\" instead of \"Lee\" and the untranslated fragment \"I see.\" The occasional literal word choices (e.g., \"preentrenamiento\" vs. \"pre-entrenamiento\") slightly reduce naturalness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento,\" \"fine-tuning,\" \"aprendizaje en contexto,\" and \"anclaje\" are accurately rendered and consistent throughout the text. The translation keeps the same terminology used in the source, which is appropriate for the target audience. Minor style variations (e.g., “preentrenamiento” without a hyphen) do not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and tone, adapting idiomatic expressions appropriately for Spanish speakers. The inclusion of alternate show names at the end is unnecessary but does not break the context. Cultural references are preserved, and the overall context is effectively communicated.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No critical information is omitted. Some redundant phrases exist (e.g., repeating “lo olvida todo”), but these do not obscure meaning. The translation remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is strong overall, accurately conveying the original content and technical concepts. Improvements could focus on smoothing out a few awkward phrases, correcting minor grammatical slips, and removing extraneous alternative show names at the end to enhance clarity and fluency for Spanish-speaking audiences."
