  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is generally understandable, but several sentences are awkwardly constructed or incomplete. The flow of the dialogue is disrupted by abrupt jumps, missing conjunctions, and some untranslated fragments, which makes it harder for a native reader to follow the conversation smoothly.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most vocabulary is correct, the overall prose lacks natural rhythm. There are literal translations that feel stilted, such as \"Aprendizaje en contexto\" (used twice with different capitalization) and the mixing of French fragments (e.g., \"On peut dire ça\") that break fluency. Sentence structure often mirrors the French source too closely, causing occasional clumsiness.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\". However, inconsistencies appear (capitalization, occasional use of English acronyms without explanation). The overall terminology is suitable for a general Spanish-speaking audience, though some terms could have been accompanied by brief explanations for clarity.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the informal podcast tone and the conversational dynamic. Nevertheless, some cultural adjustments are missing; for instance, the French interjection \"On peut dire ça\" remains untranslated, which weakens the adaptation for Spanish listeners. The script would benefit from more idiomatic expressions that resonate with a Spanish-speaking audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Key ideas from the original are mostly present, but several French segments were left untranslated, creating gaps. Additionally, some explanatory remarks were omitted or shortened, leading to a less comprehensive rendering. The missing parts reduce the completeness of the translation.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is functional but falls short in fluency and completeness. The core concepts are preserved and technical terminology is largely accurate, yet the presence of untranslated French fragments, awkward phrasing, and occasional omissions hinder overall quality. Refinement of style, better contextual adaptation, and thorough completion of the text would improve the result significantly."
