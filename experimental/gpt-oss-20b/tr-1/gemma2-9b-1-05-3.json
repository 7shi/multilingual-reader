    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable for native speakers. The sentence structure follows the original closely and the flow is logical. However, a few long sentences and some missing accents (e.g., “se expandio” instead of “se expande”) slightly reduce readability. Overall, the text is clear and comprehensible.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several awkward phrasings: \"se expandio masiva\" instead of \"se expande masivamente\", the repetition of “aprendizaje en contexto” in parentheses, and the phrase “enraizado” which is uncommon in Spanish. Additionally, the use of the dash before “o ICL (aprendizaje en contexto)” breaks the rhythm. These issues make the text feel somewhat mechanical and detract from a fully smooth reading experience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL), \"memoria a corto plazo\". The translation of “grounding” as \"enraizado\" is technically understandable but not standard; a more common choice would be \"enraizamiento\" or \"enraizamiento contextual\". The consistency of term usage is good, though. Minor inaccuracies in terminology slightly reduce the score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and conversational tone. The name of the podcast was adapted to Spanish (“Tecno Brillo”) which fits the target audience. Cultural references are minimal, and no inappropriate or confusing expressions appear. The adaptation is effective but could be polished with more idiomatic Spanish phrasing.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original is present. The Spanish version does not omit any key points, and the context is preserved. Some redundancy remains (e.g., repeating the definition of ICL), but no significant content is missing. The translation is concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is generally good and conveys the main ideas clearly. However, it shows some mechanical wording, minor grammatical slips, and a non‑standard translation of a key technical term. With a few adjustments to fluency and terminology, it would reach a higher level of quality for native Spanish speakers."
