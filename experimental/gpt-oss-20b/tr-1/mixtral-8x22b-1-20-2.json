  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is mostly easy to read, with clear sentence structure and concise explanations of complex concepts. Minor issues arise with duplicated speaker names (e.g., “Camille: Camille:”) and some slightly awkward phrasing (“Se olvida de todo”), but overall the target‑language readers can follow the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation reads naturally for native speakers, using appropriate contemporary vocabulary. However, a few literal translations (“influencia en la memoria a corto plazo” could be smoother) and minor grammatical quirks slightly reduce the flow. Overall it remains smooth but not flawless.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto* and *ICL* are correctly rendered and consistently used. Explanations for non‑technical listeners are preserved. The terminology aligns well with the intended audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone, and culturally appropriate expressions are used. Some idiomatic nuances could be refined (e.g., “proporcionarle los documentos” instead of “proporcionar los documentos”), but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present, and no significant content is omitted. The translation maintains the dialogue structure and key explanations, ensuring readers receive a complete and clear message.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the technical content, intent, and tone of the original French script. Minor refinements in phrasing and a few repetitive speaker labels would further enhance clarity and naturalness, but overall the work is coherent, accurate, and accessible to the target audience."
