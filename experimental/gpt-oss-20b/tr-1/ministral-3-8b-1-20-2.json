  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is fairly hard to follow due to frequent interruptions, incomplete sentences, and abrupt switches between languages (English, French, Spanish). While basic concepts are present, the flow feels disjointed, and readers would likely need to re‑read to grasp meaning. Therefore, readability is limited.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural repetitions such as multiple consecutive \"Exactamente.\" and awkward word choices like \"desvelar\" for \"lever le voile\" that feel stilted. Moreover, fragments of English and French comments (“Traducción al español:”, “Such is the reality of ICL.”) break the natural flow for native Spanish speakers. Fluency is therefore quite low.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are often translated correctly (e.g., \"ajuste fino\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\"), but the consistency is uneven: some terms are left in English (ICL, grounding) and others are repeated with minor variations. The use of \"aprender en contexto\" instead of a more common \"aprendizaje en contexto\" also reduces clarity. Terminology handling earns a moderate score.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original French script is conversational, aimed at a podcast audience. The Spanish version attempts to keep that style but fails to fully adapt idioms or cultural references. The use of literal translations and retained French fragments weakens the adaptation. The overall message is conveyed, but the cultural tailoring is incomplete.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several parts of the original are omitted or duplicated (e.g., the explanation of ICL and grounding), and some English sentences appear unchanged. Important nuances, such as the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, are sometimes lost or buried in awkward phrasing. The translation is therefore incomplete and contains redundancies.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is a rough, literal rendering that struggles with readability, fluency, and consistency. It preserves most of the content but suffers from awkward phrasing, mixed languages, and some missing explanations, resulting in a low overall quality for a Spanish‑speaking audience. A more polished, culturally adapted rewrite would significantly improve comprehension and naturalness.  The current version is acceptable for basic understanding but not suitable for a polished podcast transcript in Spanish without substantial revision.  Total score: 38/100."
