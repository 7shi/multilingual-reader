  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally easy to follow, but several typographical errors (e.g., \"conocencias\" instead of \"conocimientos\") and a few literal or awkward constructions (\"El aprendizaje en contexto, es el bachotage.\") slightly hinder comprehension. Overall, readers can understand the main ideas, but the readability is not perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains several unnatural expressions and grammatical slips: the phrase \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es el bachotage.\" is not Spanish, and the repeated use of capital letters in parentheses is inconsistent. These issues reduce the naturalness of the translation. However, the overall flow is acceptable, so the score is moderate.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly translated (e.g., \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ajuste fino\", \"IA\"). The word \"afinamiento\" could be replaced by the more common \"ajuste fino\". The inclusion of \"bachotage\" is a mistake, as it is a French word. Despite minor slips, the terminology is largely appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally preserves the original tone and intent, but some expressions (e.g., using \"usted\" instead of a more casual \"tú\" in a podcast context) are slightly off for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural adaptation is adequate but could be refined for a native listener’s comfort.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the source text is present, with no significant omissions. Minor redundancy is present, but it does not detract from clarity. The translation conveys the same ideas as the original.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful and understandable, but it contains several lexical and grammatical errors that affect its naturalness and clarity. With some revisions—correcting typos, replacing the non‑Spanish word \"bachotage\", and smoothing awkward phrasing—the text would reach a higher level of quality. Overall, the translation is good but requires polishing to achieve professional fluency and precision."
