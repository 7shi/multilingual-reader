  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text contains many incomplete sentences, abrupt line breaks and odd insertions such as “Pre-training” or “formation de plusieurs années” that break the flow. The overall structure is hard to follow, especially for readers who expect a coherent script. Consequently, readability is limited to a basic level.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several phrases are ungrammatical or feel like literal word‑for‑word translations (“aprendizaje en contexto” is correct, but the surrounding syntax is awkward). The mixture of English and Spanish terms (“anchoring”, “fine‑tuning”) without proper adaptation makes the text feel disjointed and unnatural to a native Spanish speaker. Fluency is therefore weak.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most key technical terms are present (e.g., fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning) but the translation is inconsistent: sometimes French words are kept (e.g., “anchoring”), sometimes the Spanish equivalents are used. Explanations of complex concepts are missing or truncated, so the target audience may not fully grasp the meaning. Terminology is partially correct but uneven.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation does not account for cultural or linguistic expectations. French idioms and colloquial expressions were left untranslated or garbled, and the script loses the conversational tone that was present in the original. The adaptation is therefore sub‑optimal.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large sections of the original dialogue are omitted or abbreviated (e.g., Luc’s explanations of pre‑training, the comparison with a consulting firm, the discussion on memory features). Some sentences are left incomplete, so key details are missing. The overall information conveyed is far less than in the source.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation requires substantial revision. It contains many structural, grammatical, and terminological errors, omits important content, and fails to preserve the natural, conversational tone of the original French script. A comprehensive rewrite that restores coherence, corrects the terminology, and ensures all original information is present would be necessary to achieve a quality Spanish version suitable for listeners or readers.\n\nOverall, the translation is below acceptable quality and needs significant improvement before it can be used for production or distribution.\n\n**Recommendation**: Start from the original French text, rewrite the Spanish version in full sentences, keep the dialogue structure, translate technical terms consistently, and preserve all key explanations. Once the draft is ready, a second review by a native Spanish speaker experienced in AI terminology would help refine fluency and contextual adaptation.\n\n**Score**: The average score across all criteria is 7.2 out of 20, indicating a very low quality that must be upgraded.\n\n**Reasoning**: The scores reflect the major deficiencies in readability, fluency, terminology, contextual adaptation, and information completeness. Each criterion was evaluated against the requirement that the translation should be easily understood, naturally phrased, technically accurate, culturally appropriate, and fully informative. The high variability between criteria shows that while some terms were correctly translated, the overall structure and completeness suffered severely.\n\n**Score**: 7.2"
