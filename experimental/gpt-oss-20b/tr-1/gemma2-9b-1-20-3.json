  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the overall flow mirrors the original. Sentences are mostly short and coherent. However, sporadic insertion of French words (e.g., “ancrage”, “Oui”) disrupts the reading rhythm, slightly lowering readability.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads well in most places, but the use of French fragments (“ancrage”, “Oui”, “La compétence est ancrée”) makes the language feel patched. There are a few awkward phrasings such as “El aprendizaje en contexto es memorizar” which could be expressed more naturally. These issues reduce fluency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms like *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)*, and *memoria a corto plazo* are correctly rendered. Consistency is good, although “grounding” remains untranslated. Minor inconsistencies with French terms appear but do not obscure meaning.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The core intent and tone of the original are preserved. The adaptation for a Spanish audience is adequate; cultural references are minimal. However, the presence of French words dilutes contextual adaptation, and a few expressions could be localized better (e.g., using “memoria a corto plazo” instead of “ventana de contexto” in a more natural way).",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Essential information is largely retained; no major content is omitted. The only missing parts are the French remnants, which do not remove meaning but add confusion. No redundant or excessive additions appear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the original’s meaning and maintains a clear structure. The main issue is the accidental retention of French terminology, which interrupts natural flow for Spanish speakers. With a few edits to remove foreign words and polish some phrasing, the translation would reach a near‑perfect level of quality, delivering both accuracy and fluency."
