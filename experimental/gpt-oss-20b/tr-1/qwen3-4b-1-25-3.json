  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally understandable, but several grammatical errors (e.g., \"Cuando abrir una nueva ventana\" instead of \"Cuando abres una nueva ventana\"), awkward phrasing, and inconsistent verb agreement (\"Las nuevas conocimientos\" instead of \"Los nuevos conocimientos\") hinder smooth reading. These mistakes make the text less accessible, especially for casual listeners. Overall, readability is acceptable but not perfect.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural expressions, such as keeping the French term \"pré-entraînement\" in quotes, using \"entrenamiento previo\" inconsistently, and mixing Spanish and English (e.g., \"fine-tunes\" left untranslated). These affect the natural flow for native Spanish speakers. While the core meaning is preserved, the overall fluency suffers due to such issues.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered (e.g., \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\"). However, some terms are left in French or incorrectly translated (\"pré-entraînement\", \"fine-tuning\" as \"afinamiento\"), leading to inconsistency. Despite this, the translator generally understood the technical concepts, so terminology is acceptable but not flawless.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely preserves the original tone and conversational style. Cultural adaptation is minimal, which is appropriate for a podcast script. Nevertheless, the presence of residual French terms and occasional literal phrasing reduces contextual cohesion. The adaptation is adequate but could be smoother.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the bulk of the information from the original French script. Minor omissions or awkward sentence fragments (e.g., missing the phrase \"C'est tout à fait ça\") are present but do not critically alter the content. The overall message remains intact, though some details are less polished.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the essential content of the original French script but suffers from multiple grammatical and stylistic errors. The use of untranslated or incorrectly translated terms, occasional mix-ups between Spanish and English, and awkward sentence construction reduce readability and fluency. While the terminology and contextual adaptation are generally sound, the translation needs revision to achieve a natural, error‑free presentation suitable for native Spanish speakers. The overall quality is below average and would benefit from a thorough edit to correct errors and unify terminology usage. The average score of 12/20 reflects these issues and suggests significant improvement is required for a professional‑grade translation."
