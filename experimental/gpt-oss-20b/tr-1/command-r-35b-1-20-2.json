  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but the presence of a misplaced JSON block, untranslated English fragments (e.g., “Thus, after pre‑training…”), and some abrupt switches between languages breaks the flow. Readers can follow most of the dialogue, yet the gaps and syntax hiccups make the overall readability lower than ideal. 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural expressions and grammatical inconsistencies, such as the untranslated English word “Thus”, the inconsistent use of quotation marks, and the insertion of a literal JSON snippet that disrupts the narrative. While many phrases read smoothly, these issues collectively reduce the naturalness of the text. 11/20.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, anclaje) are largely preserved and appropriately translated. However, some terms like “prompt” are left in English and a few technical explanations are omitted or buried in the JSON block. Overall, terminology is mostly correct but not consistently handled. 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation to Spanish culture is decent—opening with “Hola y bienvenidos” and localizing the podcast name to “Tech Relámpago” is a good touch. Yet, the translation does not fully adapt all idiomatic expressions, and the inserted JSON fragment shows a lack of editing for target‑language conventions. 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Important parts of the original are missing or untranslated (the English “Thus” line, and some explanatory content inside the JSON block). This omission reduces the completeness of the information conveyed. 10/20.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation attempts a faithful rendering but suffers from significant errors—untranslated fragments, a misplaced JSON snippet, and occasional awkward phrasing. While the core concepts are present, the lack of polish and completeness diminishes the overall quality. A more thorough editing pass would greatly improve clarity, fluency, and completeness for Spanish‑speaking listeners. The translation would benefit from a final proofread and a consistent handling of technical terms and style guidelines. The overall score reflects these shortcomings. 12/20."
