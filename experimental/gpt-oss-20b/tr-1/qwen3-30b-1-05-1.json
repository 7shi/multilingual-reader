    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely comprehensible to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Sentences are clear and logical, and the dialogue flow remains intact. However, some phrases are slightly awkward (e.g., “el modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus conversaciones” could be smoother). Overall, readability is high but not perfect.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds mostly natural, but there are a few stilted expressions: \"el modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona\" and \"justo antes de que comenzara a hablarle\". Also the use of \"constantly refined\" translated as \"es constantemente refinada\" is grammatically odd. Vocabulary choices are largely appropriate, but the flow would benefit from more idiomatic phrasing.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered – \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", and \"anclaje/grounding\". The translation consistently uses the same Spanish equivalents throughout, and explanatory paraphrases are provided where needed. Minor issue: \"grounding\" is rendered as both \"anclaje\" and \"fundamentación\" which could be unified.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and humor of the original are preserved. Cultural references are adapted appropriately (e.g., the consultant analogy). The Spanish version does not introduce any culturally inappropriate elements. However, some word choices could be more tailored to Spanish‑speaking listeners (e.g., using \"aprenderá\" instead of \"aprende\" when referring to future tense).",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogues and key points are included. No major omissions are detected. The translation stays concise while keeping the content clear. A few very minor details (e.g., tense shifts) do not alter the meaning significantly.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the core message and tone of the original French script quite well. It maintains the dialogue structure and technical terminology, making it understandable for native speakers. Nonetheless, a few sentences feel slightly clunky, and the consistency of certain terms could be tightened. With minor refinements, the translation would achieve a high level of naturalness and fluency while preserving all critical information and contextual nuance."
