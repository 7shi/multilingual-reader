    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally clear and follows the logical flow of the original dialogue. Sentences are well‑structured and the key concepts are explained in a way that most Spanish speakers would understand. Minor issues such as the occasional awkward phrasing (“lo llamo ‘pré‑entrenamiento’”) slightly affect readability but do not obscure meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall, the prose sounds natural and is free of glaring grammatical errors. Some expressions, however, feel slightly mechanical or are literal translations that do not mirror native usage (e.g., ‘lo llamo ‘pré‑entrenamiento’’, ‘una antisèche’). These do not derail comprehension but reduce the smoothness of the text.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: ‘pre‑entrenamiento’, ‘ajuste fino’, ‘aprendizaje en contexto’, ‘ventana de contexto’, ‘anclaje’. The term ‘memoria’ is used appropriately. The only inconsistency is the accidental accent on ‘pré‑entrenamiento’. Overall terminology is clear, consistent, and well explained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the intent and tone of the original French script. Cultural references are adapted sensibly, and the dialogue remains conversational. The translator could have opted for more colloquial Spanish in a few spots, but the chosen phrasing is still culturally appropriate for a general audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All segments of the original dialogue are present in the translation. No key points are omitted, and the content remains concise while providing the necessary explanations for non‑technical listeners.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality and faithfully conveys the original content. Minor editorial adjustments—such as removing the erroneous accent on ‘pré‑entrenamiento’ and refining a few idiomatic expressions—would bring it to perfection. It effectively communicates complex AI concepts in a clear, accessible manner suitable for a general audience listening to a tech podcast in Spanish. The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of both the subject matter and the target language nuances, making it a commendable effort overall.  (Score: 18/20)."
