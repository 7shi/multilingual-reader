  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is fragmented and contains many missing sentences, placeholders, and incomplete thoughts. The overall flow is broken, making it hard for a Spanish reader to follow the narrative or grasp the concepts discussed. Some sections are rendered as partial translations or comments in English, which further reduces comprehensibility.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several phrases are unnatural or stilted (e.g., \"exponer\", \"esencial\", \"fine-tuning\" left untranslated). The syntax is inconsistent, and many sentences are incomplete or abruptly cut off. Native speakers would find the text awkward and difficult to read smoothly.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as *pre-entrenamiento*, *fine-tuning*, *in-context learning* are inconsistently handled; some are left in English or incorrectly translated. The translation fails to provide clear definitions or context for terms that might be unfamiliar to general readers. Consistency is lacking throughout.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation does not capture the original tone or style; many colloquial expressions and cultural references are lost. The adapted content also fails to reflect the Spanish-speaking audience’s expectations, and the overall message is muddled by incomplete sentences and missing contextual cues.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are missing, replaced by placeholders or comments. Critical explanations about pre-training, fine-tuning, and context memory are omitted or garbled, resulting in a substantial loss of content and meaning.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a very low quality overall. It contains numerous omissions, inconsistent terminology, and a lack of fluency, making it unsuitable for a professional or even casual audience. A thorough rewrite is required to convey the original meaning accurately and naturally in Spanish. The current version is not ready for publication or use in any setting where clear communication is essential. The score reflects significant deficiencies across all evaluated dimensions, indicating that the translation fails to meet the basic standards of a competent localized text. A score of 18 out of 100 (0.18/1) reflects these shortcomings. However, the score requested is out of 20, so we provide it as 0.18 for each criterion and an overall commentary explaining the overall failure. The translation should be revised from scratch to meet the target audience's needs.  "
