  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and easy to follow. The narrative flow is preserved and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in a straightforward way. The only notable hiccup is the missing accent in “¿Porque ya entiende…?” which momentarily interrupts the natural reading rhythm, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker, with idiomatic expressions such as “construir un experto permanente” and appropriate use of formal address. Some minor issues—“tras bambalinas” feels a bit colloquial in a technical context and the capitalization of “Memoria” is inconsistent—do not significantly impede understanding but slightly reduce the polish.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "All key technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje (grounding). Acronyms are kept consistent, and the term “Memoria” is used to mirror the original feature name. Terminology is precise and appropriate for a general‑audience technical podcast.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts culturally relevant expressions while maintaining the original intent. Phrases like “contrario a enviar a un consultor a un programa de formación” resonate with Spanish-speaking audiences. The conversational tone is preserved, and the use of formal “usted” aligns with the podcast’s address style. Minor phrasing could be smoothed, but overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Every point from the French source appears in the Spanish version: the distinctions between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, the concept of grounding, and the discussion of the new memory feature. No essential detail is omitted, and the structure of the dialogue is maintained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate, clear, and largely natural. A few small punctuation and stylistic quirks reduce the perfect score, but the text successfully conveys the original content and intent to a Spanish-speaking audience without loss of meaning or nuance."
