  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to read and the structure follows the original French closely. Sentences are short and clear, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in an understandable way. Minor issues arise with some clunky phrasing (“una sola conversación”) and a few missing articles, but overall the readability is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Word choice is appropriate, and the overall rhythm of the dialogue is preserved. However, there are a few awkward expressions (“se le ha solo proporcionado una antisèche”, “aparecen”) that reduce fluidity slightly. The grammatical structures are mostly correct, though some subject‑verb agreement errors appear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto” and “ventana de contexto” are correctly translated and consistently used. Minor issues include the use of the French word “antisèche” instead of a Spanish equivalent. Overall, terminology is accurate and clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone. Cultural references are neutral and appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The opening greeting (“Hola y bienvenidos”) and the closing (“hasta pronto”) fit typical podcast conventions. No significant cultural misunderstandings or mistranslations were detected.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French script is present. No important details are omitted. The translation includes all explanatory analogies and the final call‑to‑action. Some small redundancies exist but do not affect clarity.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and largely faithful to the original French. It conveys the technical concepts, maintains the conversational flow, and adapts culturally without losing meaning. A few minor language quirks and a single foreign term (“antisèche”) stand out, but these do not significantly impede understanding. Overall, the translation is professional and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience."
