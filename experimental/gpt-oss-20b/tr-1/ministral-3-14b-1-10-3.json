  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable to a native speaker and the main concepts are conveyed. However, the use of Markdown symbols (**, *, etc.), literal English words such as “Precisely.”, and occasional missing articles make the flow feel disjointed. Sentence structures are generally correct but the presence of duplicated or out‑of‑place segments reduces clarity. Overall, readability is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound awkward or unnatural, e.g. “Precisely.” instead of “Precisamente.”, “Tal es la realidad del ICL.”, and the frequent insertion of English words or Markdown formatting. Some phrases are too literal (e.g., “empollarse” for “bashotage”) and others feel forced (“La IA no ha «olvidado» en el sentido humano del término”). The dialogue does not flow smoothly, leading to a jarring listening experience. Fluency is therefore mediocre.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are translated correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *grounding* (ancrage). Consistency is generally maintained, though the term *fine‑tuning* is sometimes left in English. Some specialized jargon such as “ventana de contexto” is accurate, but the overall terminology is coherent and appropriate for the target audience. Minor inconsistencies and occasional untranslated English words reduce the score slightly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator attempts to adapt cultural references, replacing French idioms with Spanish equivalents (e.g., “empollarse” for “bashotage”). However, some literal translations (e.g., “Precisely.”) and the inclusion of meta‑text (“Traducción al español (versión final)”) disrupt the naturalness. The overall intent of the dialogue is retained, but some expressions feel forced or out of context. Adaptation is adequate but could be improved.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all dialogue lines are present, though a few English placeholders (“Precisely.”) were not translated, and some segments were duplicated or omitted (e.g., the repeated “Traducción al español (versión final)”). Despite these minor gaps, the essential information from the original French script is largely preserved, with no major omissions.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the gist of the original dialogue and most technical terms, but suffers from several issues that hinder readability and fluency. Literal English insertions, Markdown artifacts, and occasional mistranslations make the text feel uneven. While the essential content is largely intact, the style and natural flow need considerable refinement for a polished Spanish broadcast."
