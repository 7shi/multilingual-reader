  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, especially for native speakers familiar with the topic. The structure follows the original French dialogue closely, and the sequence of ideas remains clear. However, a few awkward phrasings—such as *“le proporcionar simplemente los documentos”* or *“la IA no es constantemente afinada”*—can momentarily interrupt the flow and may require a second glance for full comprehension. Overall, the text is readable with only minor hindrances.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is smooth in many parts, but several grammatical slips and unnatural constructions diminish fluency. Notable issues include the use of *“fundamento”* where *“anclaje”* would be appropriate, the literal French word *“antisèche”* inserted in a Spanish sentence, and phrasing such as *“le proporcionar”* instead of *“proporcionarle”*. These errors make the text feel slightly mechanical and less natural to a native Spanish reader. Nevertheless, the majority of sentences read naturally.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are translated correctly: *pré-entrenamiento → preentrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning → ajuste fino*, *In‑Context Learning → aprendizaje en contexto*, *memory → memoria*. The mis‑translation of *grounding* as *fundamento* is a significant slip, as it changes the meaning. The consistent use of *ajuste fino* and *aprendizaje en contexto* demonstrates good terminology handling overall. Slight inconsistencies and a few mis‑rendered words bring the score down slightly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely preserves the conversational tone and the explanatory intent of the original French script. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is straightforward. The use of terms like *“consultor brillante”* and *“consultor temporal”* is appropriate for a Spanish-speaking audience. However, the inadvertent insertion of the French word *“antisèche”* detracts from contextual consistency. Overall, the adaptation is solid, but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French source are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory functions, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No significant content is omitted. The only minor addition is an explanatory note about how the system “automatically” retrieves relevant past exchanges—this is a helpful clarification but not a direct copy. The overall content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation faithfully conveys the key concepts and structure of the original French dialogue, preserving most technical terms and maintaining the conversational flow. However, several linguistic slips—especially the mistranslation of *grounding*, the improper use of *antisèche*, and some awkward phrasing—lower the overall quality. With a few corrections, the translation would be natural, clear, and highly accurate for a native Spanish audience."
