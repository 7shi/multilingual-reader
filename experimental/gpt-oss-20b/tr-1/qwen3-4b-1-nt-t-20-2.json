    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the overall meaning and key concepts of the original French script. Sentences are generally understandable, and the flow follows the dialogue structure. However, some phrases feel stilted or overly formal in places (e.g., “Usted” instead of the more conversational “tú”), and a few lines contain repeated or slightly redundant wording, which can slightly impede smooth reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely natural, but several spots break the rhythm of native speech. The unexpected insertion of the French word “C’est logique” in the middle of a Spanish sentence and the use of “Se puede decir así” instead of a more idiomatic phrase weaken the overall fluency. Additionally, the shift from informal to formal address (“tú” vs. “Usted”) is inconsistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, and *anclaje* are correctly rendered and consistently used. Minor mistranslations (e.g., *pre-entrenamiento* as *preentrenamiento* – a small style choice rather than a substantive error) do not significantly affect comprehension. The terminology is appropriate for a general audience.",

    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent of the podcast dialogue is preserved, and the cultural context of Spanish‑speaking listeners is largely respected. Nevertheless, the mix of French and Spanish (“C’est logique”) and the occasional overly literal phrasing (“apropio” versus more natural equivalents) suggest a lack of full contextual polish. The translation could benefit from tighter localization to Spanish media conventions.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant information is omitted. The transcript’s key ideas—pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and the concept of memory features—are all present. Minor redundancies appear (e.g., repeated analogy of biking), but overall the content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation does a solid job of conveying the main concepts from the French original and uses most of the correct terminology. However, it suffers from occasional awkward phrasing, a few inconsistent register shifts, and a lingering French fragment that detracts from fluency. With minor stylistic adjustments, the translation could reach a high level of native‑speaker naturalness while maintaining clarity and completeness. Overall, it is a competent, if not perfect, rendering of the source text, suitable for general audiences familiar with AI terminology but requiring a slight polish for a polished broadcast style."
