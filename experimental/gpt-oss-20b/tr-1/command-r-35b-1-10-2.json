  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the conversational structure of the original. Sentences are relatively short and the use of direct translations for key terms keeps the meaning clear. However, the inclusion of stray English parenthetical remarks and some awkward phrasing (e.g., “¿Me refiero a…?” instead of a proper translation of the question) can momentarily confuse readers. Overall, the content remains accessible but not perfectly smooth.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural elements: quotation marks around whole sentences, inconsistent punctuation, and occasional literal wording that feels stilted (e.g., “una cantidad significativamente menor de texto” instead of a more idiomatic phrasing). The mixing of English fragments in some lines detracts from naturalness. Nonetheless, native speakers would largely understand the message, so the fluency is acceptable but below perfect.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly translated correctly: \"pré-entraînement\" → \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\" → \"especialización\", \"In‑Context Learning\" → \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\", \"memory\" → \"Memoria\". Some terms could be more precise (e.g., \"ajuste fino\" for fine‑tuning), but overall terminology is consistent and understandable at the target level.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue preserves the playful, explanatory tone of the original. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is mostly a literal rendering. However, the translation sometimes misrepresents the intent of certain lines (e.g., \"¿Me refiero a…?\" does not convey the original question about transfer learning). The inclusion of English parentheticals also weakens the adaptation for a pure Spanish audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is present. Minor omissions exist (e.g., the brief English explanation of transfer learning was omitted, but it was not a central sentence). The overall narrative flow and key explanations remain intact, and no major factual errors appear. Some duplicated or missing punctuation could slightly alter meaning, but overall the information is complete.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in conveying the main ideas and keeps the conversational style, but it is hindered by occasional literal wording, misplaced punctuation, and stray English fragments. The technical terms are handled well, yet contextual nuance could be improved. For a professional or academic audience, a more polished revision would enhance clarity and naturalness. The work is solid but not yet at a publishable standard for a native Spanish‑speaking audience without further editing. The overall quality is moderate to good, with a final score of 15/20 based on the average of the individual criteria scores. "
