  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely understandable; the speaker’s intent is clear and analogies are preserved. However, a few sentences have minor grammatical slips (e.g., missing articles or prepositions) that can momentarily disrupt flow. Overall, readers can follow the discussion without major difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly natural, but several expressions feel slightly clunky: the omission of the capital ‘E’ in “Es aquí donde”, awkward use of “Lo has entendido todo”, and occasional abrupt punctuation. The overall register is appropriate for a casual podcast script, yet polish would improve smoothness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre-entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto* (ICL), *ventana de contexto*, *anclaje*, and *memoria* are correctly rendered and consistent throughout. Minor inconsistencies (e.g., using *prompt* untranslated) are acceptable given common usage.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Cultural adaptation is handled well—greetings are localized, and phrasing feels native to a Spanish-speaking audience. Minor issues include slightly literal translations of idioms (e.g., “Lo has entendido todo”) and occasional missing pronouns, but these do not alter meaning.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue segments are present, and no substantive information from the original French is omitted. The translation keeps the explanatory tone, maintains analogies, and preserves the conversational structure.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the essence of the original French text with a high degree of accuracy and readability. Minor grammatical and stylistic refinements would elevate fluency to a truly native level, but the current version is functional and clear for its intended audience. The translator demonstrates a solid grasp of both linguistic nuance and technical terminology."
