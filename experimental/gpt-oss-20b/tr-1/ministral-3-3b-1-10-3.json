  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The target text is fragmented and contains many incomplete sentences and abrupt transitions. Readers would struggle to follow the narrative because key explanatory passages from the original are missing or garbled. Basic clarity is compromised, but some sentences are still understandable at a superficial level.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish output contains several unnatural expressions (e.g., *el afinado*, *la Mémoire*), literal word‑for‑word translations that do not flow naturally in Spanish, and frequent grammatical errors such as missing accents and incorrect gender agreement. Phrases that should be idiomatic are rendered literally, making the text feel stilted.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are often mistranslated or inconsistently used. For instance, *le affinement* is rendered as *el afinado* (rare), *fine‑tuning* is missing, and *grounding* appears only once without the appropriate Spanish equivalent. The translation does not provide consistent, reader‑friendly terminology throughout.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to capture the conversational tone and cultural references of the original podcast. It also injects unrelated commentary and editorial notes that are not present in the source. Consequently, the intent and nuance of the original dialogue are not effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original script are omitted or partially duplicated. Key explanations (e.g., about ICL vs fine‑tuning, the role of memory, the example of language transfer) are either missing or severely truncated. The output does not provide a comprehensive account of the source material.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is highly incomplete and contains many linguistic and technical errors. It does not provide a coherent, accurate, or readable rendition of the French podcast transcript. Major revisions are needed to correct terminology, complete missing content, and improve fluency and cultural adaptation before it could be considered usable for Spanish‑speaking audiences."
