  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is highly fragmented, with many incomplete sentences and abrupt switches between French and Spanish. This makes it difficult for a native Spanish speaker to follow the dialogue or grasp the underlying concepts. The logical flow that exists in the original is largely lost, reducing overall comprehensibility.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish portions contain numerous grammatical errors (e.g., misuse of gender and number, missing articles, awkward word order). Non‑natural phrasing such as \"en el sentido humano\" or the insertion of stray brackets and comments interrupts the rhythm of the conversation, making it feel stilted and unpolished.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Some key technical terms are correctly rendered (e.g., \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprender en contexto\"), but many others are either omitted or mistranslated (e.g., \"grounding\" remains untranslated or rendered inconsistently). Additionally, the translation does not consistently apply the chosen terminology throughout, leading to confusion.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to adapt idiomatic expressions or cultural references to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Phrases like \"abrir una nueva ventana\" are literally translated but not contextualized for podcast listeners. The original humor and conversational tone are largely lost, and the Spanish version does not convey the same intent or emotional nuance.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are missing or replaced with placeholder text (e.g., \"Luc: ...\", \"Camille: ...\" without content). Important explanatory parts about fine‑tuning, ICL, and memory features are either incomplete or omitted entirely. The resulting translation does not provide a coherent narrative or comprehensive coverage of the concepts discussed.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a rough, draft‑like approach rather than a polished, finished product. Significant structural, grammatical, and terminological issues compromise readability, fluency, and completeness. For a professional or academic audience, this version would not be acceptable without extensive revision. The core concepts are partially present but heavily obscured by errors and omissions, making the text unsuitable for conveying the original podcast’s content accurately and engagingly. A complete rewrite with careful attention to narrative flow, consistent terminology, and cultural adaptation is necessary to achieve an effective Spanish translation of the original French text."
