  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is highly fragmented, with many incomplete sentences and abrupt shifts between speakers. The lack of coherent paragraph structure and missing contextual bridges makes it difficult for a native Spanish reader to follow the dialogue and understand the sequence of ideas. Therefore, readability is scored low.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions feel forced or grammatically awkward – e.g., \"completamente nueva IA\" instead of the natural \"una IA completamente nueva\" – and there are numerous unfinished lines. While basic Spanish grammar is used, the overall flow is disrupted by inserted notes and comments. Fluency thus receives a modest score.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento\" and \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" are present, but other important concepts (e.g., \"fine-tuning\" is rendered as \"afinar\" without clarification) are inconsistently translated or omitted. The use of \"anclaje\" for \"grounding\" is acceptable, yet the term \"In‑Context Learning\" is only partially captured as \"aprendizaje en contexto\". Consequently, terminology handling earns an average score.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Some cultural adjustments (e.g., simplifying phrases) are made, but the translation largely preserves the original structure without smoothing it for a Spanish-speaking audience. The lack of cohesive adaptation across the entire dialogue limits the effectiveness of the communication. The score reflects this partial adaptation.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are missing or truncated (e.g., the speaker turns after \"Luc: ...\" are incomplete, and explanatory remarks are omitted). This omission significantly reduces the informational value of the translation. Thus the score is low.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is heavily fragmentary and contains numerous omissions, unnatural phrasing, and inconsistent terminology. While some technical terms are preserved, the overall readability, fluency, and completeness are insufficient for a polished, listener‑friendly podcast transcript. A thorough rewrite with full sentences, consistent technical language, and better flow is needed to meet a high‑quality standard for Spanish audiences. The final overall score reflects these shortcomings and indicates room for substantial improvement. The overall score is 7/20, based on the average of the individual criteria scores (6 + 7 + 8 + 7 + 5 = 33 / 5 ≈ 6.6)."
