  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, but several sentences contain grammatical inaccuracies (e.g., \"un reciente graduado\" instead of \"un recién graduado\") and awkward word order that can confuse the reader. Overall, readers can follow the content, but the flow could be smoother.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Some phrases are overly literal or contain minor errors (missing accents, improper capitalization). Phrases like \"¡Por lo tanto, después del preentrenamiento…\" feel clunky. The text sounds somewhat mechanical rather than natural Spanish, reducing fluency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are preserved: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste (fine‑tuning)\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"memoria a corto plazo\". The translation of \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\" is acceptable. Minor inconsistencies in style (e.g., sometimes capitalized, sometimes not) are present but do not distort meaning.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to adapt idioms, yet it falls back on literal structures in places (e.g., \"la IA es como un reciente graduado universitario\"). Cultural references are largely preserved, but the overall tone could be more conversational to match the podcast style.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French script are present; no critical information is omitted. A slight duplication occurs in the passage about transfer learning, but it does not alter meaning. The content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is reasonably faithful and mostly readable, but it suffers from several minor grammatical errors, a few awkward phrasings, and some literalness that detracts from naturalness. With a few adjustments—especially in correcting tense, capitalization, and idiomatic expression—the translation would reach a higher level of quality. Overall, it functions well for a general audience but would benefit from polishing for professional podcast use."
