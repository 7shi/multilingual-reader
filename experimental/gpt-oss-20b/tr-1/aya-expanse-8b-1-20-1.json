    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable for native speakers, with most sentences following a clear logical flow. However, a few sentences are structurally awkward or too long (e.g., “La optimización… ¿es ahí donde entra el aprendizaje por transferencia?”), and some explanations are added that were not present in the original. Overall, the content is readable but could benefit from tighter sentence construction and removal of extraneous comments.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural expressions and minor grammatical slips (“tela es la realidad del ICL”, “un caballo” instead of “una bicicleta”). The choice of words like “optimización” for fine‑tuning is also inaccurate, which disrupts naturalness. Despite these issues, the bulk of the dialogue flows smoothly and is comprehensible to a native Spanish speaker. The overall fluency is acceptable but not native‑level.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly correct – \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\". The major slip is translating \"fine‑tuning\" as \"optimización\" instead of \"ajuste fino\" or \"afinamiento\", which may confuse readers. Additionally, the term \"in‑context learning\" is translated consistently. Overall, terminology is appropriate but needs a few corrections.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the conversational style and intent of the original French podcast. It also adapts some expressions to a Spanish-speaking audience (e.g., using colloquial phrases). However, the addition of explanatory text that was not in the source (“Camille explica cómo se conecta la salida de la IA…”) slightly diverges from the original structure, and the mistranslation of \"tela\" could mislead readers. Cultural adaptation is adequate but not flawless.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original dialogue is retained, and the core concepts are covered. Some lines are omitted or slightly rephrased, and the added explanatory passages can be seen as extra rather than missing information. The mistranslation of fine‑tuning as optimization may lead to a loss of precise meaning. Overall, the information is largely complete but contains minor omissions and additions.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers the general sense of the original conversation and includes most of the key ideas. Nonetheless, it suffers from several inaccuracies in terminology, a few typographical errors, and some unnatural phrasing. The added commentary deviates from the source and may distract the reader. With a few corrections – especially regarding fine‑tuning, the mistranslated word \"tela\", and tightening of sentence structures – the translation could reach a higher quality level suitable for a professional Spanish‑speaking audience."
