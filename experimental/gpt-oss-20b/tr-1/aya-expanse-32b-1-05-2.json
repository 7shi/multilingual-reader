  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand; the conversational flow mirrors the French original and the sentences are logically organized. The use of simple phrasing for complex concepts (e.g., “aprendizaje en contexto” and “ajuste fino”) helps readability, though the occasional plural form “Lo habéis” can momentarily confuse a single‑speaker context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall, the translation sounds natural for native Spanish speakers. The vocabulary is contemporary and the syntax is smooth. Minor issues include the plural address “Lo habéis” where a singular form might be clearer, and a slightly awkward comma placement in the ICL sentence, but these do not significantly impede fluency.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "All technical terms are correctly rendered: pre-entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, anclaje, ventana de contexto. The translation keeps a consistent terminology throughout and explains the concepts adequately, matching the reader’s level of understanding.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation respects cultural context; expressions like “consultor brillante” and “consultor temporal” are idiomatic. The use of “vosotros” in “Lo habéis” is slightly uncommon in Latin‑American Spanish, but acceptable in some contexts. Overall, intent and purpose are well conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No key information from the original is omitted. All dialogue turns, explanations, and examples are preserved, and the translation keeps the content concise without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is high quality, faithfully conveying the technical details and conversational tone of the French source. Minor grammatical quirks—particularly the plural address in a two‑person dialogue—do not undermine the overall clarity or naturalness. With a few small adjustments, this would be a polished final version suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
