  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the original structure closely. Sentences are short and clear, and the conversational flow is preserved. The only major obstacle to readability is a duplicated speaker tag (“Camille: Camille: …”) which may momentarily confuse a reader. Overall, readers can follow the episode without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly natural and idiomatic, but a few phrases feel slightly literal or awkward. Examples include “Lo has entendido todo” (informal but acceptable) and “El ajuste fino... ¿es ahí donde entra en juego el ‘aprendizaje por transferencia’?” which could be phrased more smoothly. Additionally, the duplicated speaker tag is a syntactic error that disrupts fluency. Nevertheless, the majority of the text reads well to a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *in‑context learning* (ICL), *anclaje*, and *memoria a corto plazo* are correctly translated and consistently used. The only minor issue is the choice of “anclamiento” instead of the more common “anclaje,” but it does not hinder comprehension. Overall, terminology is handled appropriately.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the informal, podcast‑style tone of the original and uses culturally neutral Spanish expressions. There is no major mismatch with the target audience; however, the duplication of the speaker tag indicates a lapse in proofreading, which slightly detracts from contextual polish.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All substantive content from the original French transcript is present. The duplicated speaker tag is the only small error that might mislead a reader, but it does not remove any information. No unnecessary additions or omissions appear, and the text remains concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, successfully conveying the original content with clear explanations of complex concepts. Minor issues—chiefly the duplicated speaker tag and a few slightly awkward phrasings—prevent a perfect score. With these corrected, the translation would be considered excellent for native Spanish‑speaking audiences."
