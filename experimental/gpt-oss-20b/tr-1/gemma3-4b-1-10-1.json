    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely understandable, but several sentences are truncated or grammatically incorrect (e.g., \"Camille: Veo.\" and \"Luc: Cuando abre una nueva ventana\" without continuation). These gaps interrupt the flow and make parts of the dialogue difficult to follow. Additionally, the sentence structure in places is clunky, such as \"El ajuste fino persisten en todas las conversaciones, para siempre?\" which should read \"El ajuste fino persiste en todas las conversaciones, para siempre?\". Despite these issues, the overall message is still comprehensible for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation uses a conversational register appropriate for a podcast, but there are several unnatural expressions and word choices: \"suelen\" appears out of place, \"bachoter\" is not a standard Spanish verb, and the phrasing \"le hemos proporcionado un recordatorio rápido\" is somewhat awkward. Some sentences also lack proper punctuation or capitalization. Nevertheless, the text reads smoothly in most parts, which boosts its fluency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"ICL\" are used consistently. The translation correctly localises \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\". However, there are minor inconsistencies, such as using \"ajuste fino\" instead of the more common \"fine‑tuning\" in English‑speaking contexts, and the phrase \"aprender en contexto\" should be \"aprendizaje en contexto\". Overall, terminology handling is acceptable but not flawless.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator attempts to adapt cultural references to a Spanish audience, replacing idioms like \"la nueva generación de la IA\" with more neutral phrasing. The overall intent of the original is maintained, but the inclusion of the stray word \"suelen\" and the omission of the key question about consulting vs. expert permanent reduce the contextual fidelity. The adaptation could have been smoother.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several pieces of information from the original are missing or incomplete: the question \"¿Ai-je besoin d'un consultant temporaire ou d'un expert permanent ?\" is omitted, some sentences are cut off (e.g., \"Luc: Cuando abre una nueva ventana\"), and the final sign‑off is truncated. These omissions reduce the overall completeness of the translation.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures most of the original content and uses appropriate technical terminology, but it suffers from incomplete sentences, awkward phrasing, and missing key information. The overall quality is moderate, and with careful proofreading and completion of omitted sections it could be raised to a higher standard."
