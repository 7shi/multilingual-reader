  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text contains numerous incomplete sentences, missing punctuation, and abrupt transitions that make it hard to follow. Many key ideas are either fragmented or placed incorrectly, which forces readers to guess the intended meaning. Consequently, comprehension is limited and the overall flow is disrupted. Score: 8/20.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several phrases are literal or awkwardly constructed, such as \"La tuning…\" or \"pré-entraînement\" left untranslated. The verb forms and syntax often do not align with standard Spanish usage, leading to a choppy and unnatural reading experience. Score: 5/20.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are inconsistently translated. While some are rendered correctly (e.g., \"aprendizaje por transferencia\"), others remain in French (\"pré-entraînement\", \"fenêtre de contexte\") or are misspelled. The lack of consistent terminology makes the translation confusing for readers unfamiliar with the subject. Score: 4/20.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation does not adequately adapt idiomatic expressions or cultural references to Spanish-speaking audiences. Phrases like \"tune…\" are not idiomatic, and the tone sometimes feels too literal. Some contextual nuances from the original French are lost, reducing the impact of the dialogue. Score: 6/20.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Key parts of the conversation are missing or garbled (e.g., the exchange about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and memory features). The flow of ideas is interrupted, and several explanatory passages are omitted. This omission hampers the reader’s understanding of the overall narrative. Score: 5/20.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates significant issues across readability, fluency, terminology, contextual adaptation, and completeness. It is difficult for a native Spanish speaker to follow the content, and several technical concepts are either mistranslated or omitted. The result is a disjointed and confusing rendition that fails to convey the original podcast’s intent and clarity. A substantial revision is needed to produce an accurate, natural, and coherent translation suitable for the target audience. The overall quality is low, reflecting the cumulative shortcomings in each evaluated domain. The final overall score is 5.6/20, indicating a translation that requires extensive improvement before it can be considered usable."
