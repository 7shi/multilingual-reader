    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally easy to follow. Sentence structures mirror the original and most technical concepts are conveyed clearly. Minor punctuation and accent errors (e.g., missing accent in “¿Porque” and the leftover French phrase “Voyez plutôt”) slightly interrupt the flow, but overall readers can grasp the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation mostly sounds natural for native speakers. However, some expressions feel awkward or incomplete: the phrase “Voyez plutôt” was left in French, and the abbreviation “AIC” instead of “ICL” introduces confusion. Additionally, the lack of accents on words like “¿Porque” and the occasional literal translation of idioms detracts from smoothness. The overall fluency is acceptable but not flawless.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most key terms are correctly translated (preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto). Yet the abbreviation for In‑Context Learning is incorrectly rendered as “AIC (Aprendizaje In‑Contexto)”, and the word “transferencia” is sometimes omitted in context. The terminology is mostly appropriate but inconsistencies reduce precision.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the conversational tone and adapts cultural references well (e.g., “¡Hasta pronto!”). The dialogue remains engaging and the audience is addressed appropriately. Only the inadvertent French phrase and abbreviation issue slightly diminish contextual polish.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present. No significant omissions are detected. The translation provides the same depth of explanation, and redundancy is minimal. Thus the information completeness is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation effectively conveys the original content and maintains the conversational style of the podcast. It demonstrates good readability and most terminology is correctly handled. However, several small errors—such as incorrect abbreviations, leftover French words, and missing accent marks—affect fluency and terminological precision. With minor revisions these issues could be resolved, yielding a near‑perfect translation."
