  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated dialogue contains several awkward insertions such as the mix of French and Spanish in \"¡Bonjour y bienvenido/a\" and the fragment \"C'est a decir?\" which interrupt the flow. While the main ideas are largely understandable, the presence of untranslated French phrases and incomplete sentences hampers a smooth reading experience. The overall sentence structure is sometimes broken, requiring readers to mentally translate missing parts.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text is noticeably uneven in its naturalness. Phrases like \"¡Bonjour y bienvenido/a\", \"C'est a decir?\", and the occasional insertion of English words (e.g., \"grounding\") give the translation a choppy feel. Moreover, several sentences are fragmented or use literal translations that do not flow like native Spanish. This reduces the overall fluency of the piece.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms such as *pre-entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, and *anclaje* are present and mostly correct. However, the abbreviation ICL is not explained, and some terms are left in French (e.g., \"C'est là qu'intervient le concept d'ancrage\"). Consistency across the dialogue is lacking, which could confuse a non‑expert reader.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation struggles to fully adapt the original tone and context. The blend of French, Spanish, and English words disrupts the cultural appropriateness for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The conversational register is partially maintained, but the lack of complete adaptation (e.g., missing jokes, colloquial expressions) weakens the overall contextual fidelity.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Significant portions of the original dialogue are omitted or garbled. The inserted commentary (the “Contextual Interpretation” section) does not belong in the final text, while some explanations of key concepts are missing. Consequently, the translation does not fully convey all information present in the source.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation attempts to convey the dialogue but suffers from many structural, lexical, and completeness issues. While the main ideas are discernible, the mixture of languages, incomplete sentences, and missing explanations impede readability and naturalness. A revision that fully localizes the content, removes non‑Spanish fragments, and ensures all technical terms are consistently translated would substantially improve the quality of this work."
