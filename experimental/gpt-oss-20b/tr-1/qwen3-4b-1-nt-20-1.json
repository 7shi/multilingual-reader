  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally clear and easy to follow for a Spanish-speaking audience. The sentences are mostly well‑structured and the explanations of complex concepts such as pre‑training and in‑context learning are understandable. Some long sentences could be split for even greater clarity, but overall readability is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural and flows smoothly. However, there are a few awkward expressions such as \"informaciones de las que necesita\" (should be singular) and missing punctuation marks in question sentences. These small issues slightly reduce the native feel of the prose.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are translated accurately: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\". Terminology is consistent throughout and appropriate for a general audience. Only minor stylistic alternatives could be used, but they do not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator maintained the original intent and tone, using Spanish idioms that fit the context. Cultural references are adapted correctly (e.g., \"consultor brillante\" instead of literal translations). Some phrases could be slightly more idiomatic, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present, with no omissions or distortions. The translated version also retains the conversational back‑and‑forth and the illustrative examples. Redundancy is minimal and the content remains concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material and delivers clear, accurate content in Spanish. Minor grammatical and stylistic errors—particularly in pluralization and punctuation—are the main areas for improvement. With a few adjustments, this would be an excellent, high‑quality translation."
