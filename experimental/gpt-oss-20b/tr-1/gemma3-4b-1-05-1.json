  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, but several sentences are fragmented or duplicated (e.g., \"Luc: Luc: Imaginen\"). The logical flow of ideas is preserved, yet occasional missing articles and awkward conjunctions can hinder quick comprehension for native readers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural, but there are repetitive tags, inconsistent punctuation, and a few unnatural word choices such as \"aprende francés a una velocidad increíble\" (could be \"aprende francés muy rápido\"). These quirks slightly break the smoothness expected from a polished Spanish text.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly translated correctly: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\" (as \"afinamiento\"), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\". The acronym ICL is not highlighted, and the term \"grounding\" is rendered as \"anclaje\", which is acceptable. Minor inconsistencies remain (e.g., \"ajuste fino\" could be another option for \"fine‑tuning\").",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The script keeps the original informal podcast tone and does not introduce cultural references that might confuse Spanish‑speaking audiences. However, some localization could improve naturalness (e.g., using \"consultor\" instead of \"consultor brillante\" is fine, but the phrase \"se olvida todo\" could be smoothed to \"olvida todo\"). Overall adaptation is adequate.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French source are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, short‑term memory vs. permanent learning, and the memory‑feature analogy. The occasional duplication or missing punctuation does not alter the conveyed information. No essential content is omitted.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation delivers the core content and preserves the conversational style of the original podcast. While readability and fluency are solid, a few repetitive elements and minor wording issues reduce the polish. Terminology is handled well, though some acronym use and term consistency could be tightened. The translation is sufficiently complete and culturally appropriate, making it a competent, though not flawless, version of the original text."
