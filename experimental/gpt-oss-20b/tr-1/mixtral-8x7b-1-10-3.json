  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version contains numerous interruptions (e.g., stray English phrases such as \"Pré-entraînement\" and \"Precisely\"), inserted editorial commentary that does not exist in the original, and a fragmented structure that hampers the flow of the dialogue. These issues reduce the clarity for a Spanish‑speaking audience, especially those unfamiliar with the technical content. However, where the translation follows the original order and includes most of the content, the sentence structure is still understandable. Hence, a moderate score is appropriate.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several phrases sound unnatural or are direct, literal translations that do not reflect typical Spanish usage. Examples include \"la tuning…\" instead of \"el afinamiento\", “Precise” left in English, and awkward constructions like \"la IA no se está afilando\". Additionally, some word choices (e.g., \"anclaje\" vs the more common \"fundamentación\") and missing diacritics detract from the overall naturalness. Therefore the fluency is low.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms are mostly translated correctly (pre‑training → pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning → afinación), but inconsistencies appear (\"ancrage\" vs \"ancraje\"; \"fenêtre de contexte\" left untranslated). The use of the acronym ICL (In‑Context Learning) is retained, which is acceptable, but some technical explanations are omitted or inserted incorrectly. The inconsistent handling of terminology reduces the overall accuracy.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to keep the original intent but fails to fully adapt cultural references. Expressions like \"cajas negras\" are okay, yet the use of English terms mixed in Spanish can confuse listeners. Some idiomatic parallels (e.g., \"ba­chotage\" for cram) are preserved, but the cultural nuance of consulting vs. expertise is not emphasized strongly enough. Minor improvements could have been made.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Significant content from the original French is missing or garbled. The Spanish version includes stray editorial commentary not present in the source, and some lines are omitted (e.g., parts of the dialogue about memory and context). While most of the main points are present, the omissions and added noise mean the translation is not fully complete. Hence a lower score.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a basic understanding of the source material but is marred by numerous errors that affect readability, fluency, and accuracy. It is suitable only for an audience with a strong command of both languages and a high tolerance for inconsistencies. Significant revisions are required to produce a polished, fully faithful translation suitable for a professional podcast audience in Spanish. The overall quality is moderate but falls short of acceptable standards for published content. The average score is 10/20, reflecting the need for substantial improvement in all areas except basic term mapping. "
