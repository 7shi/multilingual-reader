  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally easy to follow and retains the original dialogue’s structure. The sentence flow is logical, and key concepts are conveyed in a straightforward manner. Minor readability hiccups arise from some slightly long sentences and a few places where the flow could be tightened, but overall the target audience can grasp the content without much effort.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads quite naturally for a Spanish speaker and the vocabulary is appropriate. However, there are a handful of awkward phrasings and grammatical mismatches, such as the plural form in \"Ustedes lo han entendido todo\" instead of the singular \"Lo has entendido todo\". The use of \"se ve\" in some contexts also feels slightly stilted. These issues lower the fluency score slightly, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: \"ajuste fino\" for fine‑tuning, \"aprendizaje en contexto\" for ICL, and \"ventana de contexto\" for context window. The translator also kept \"anclaje\" for grounding. There is some inconsistency with capitalisation (e.g., sometimes \"Memoria\" is capitalised, sometimes not), but the terminology remains understandable for a general audience. Minor paraphrasing could improve clarity in a few spots, but overall terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references well. Spanish idioms like \"conducir a un consultor brillante\" replace the French metaphor, and the dialogue feels appropriate for Spanish-speaking listeners. Some expressions (e.g., \"se ve\" instead of \"se entiende\") could be more idiomatic. The adaptation maintains the original intent, but a few phrases might feel slightly formal compared to everyday Spanish broadcasting language.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French text are present in the Spanish version. The translator preserved the structure and did not omit any significant content. No redundant information is added, and the translation remains concise while still comprehensive. The only minor omission is the explicit mention of the original word \"grounding\" in parentheses, which was translated directly as \"anclaje\", but this is still clear to readers.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and faithful to the source. It effectively conveys the technical concepts and conversational tone of the original podcast. While there are a few minor grammatical and stylistic issues that could be polished, the translation remains clear, natural, and comprehensive for Spanish-speaking audiences. Addressing the small fluency and consistency problems would bring the work to an even higher standard. Overall, the translation is of high quality and suitable for publication or broadcast as a Spanish version of the podcast episode. 80/100 points."
