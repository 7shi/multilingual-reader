  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text largely follows the original sentence structure and can be understood by native readers, but numerous typos (e.g., *francen*, *conocences*), awkward phrasing (*Entonces*, *sur la marcha*), and occasional broken sentences detract from smooth comprehension. Nonetheless, the overall narrative flow remains clear.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many expressions feel unnatural or incomplete: *es del cram* (mix of English and Spanish), *C'est donc une mémoire à usage unique* remains in French, and the formal pronoun *Usted* is inconsistent with the informal tone of the original. The sentence construction is sometimes stilted, and the presence of untranslated words (*grounding*) reduces fluidity.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *ventana de contexto*, *fine‑tuning* are correctly translated, but there are several errors: *francen* instead of *francés*, *conocences* instead of *conocimientos*, and the use of *cram* instead of *estudio intensivo*. The term *grounding* is left untranslated. Consistency is therefore moderate.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to keep the informal, conversational style of the original, but the mixture of French fragments and inconsistent pronouns (formal vs. informal) undermines cultural adaptation. Phrases like *sur la marcha* (French) and *Telle est la réalité de l'ICL* (French) should have been fully translated to Spanish for a coherent adaptation.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original dialogue are present, and the overall content is complete. However, minor omissions or mistranslations (e.g., *francen*, *conocences*) slightly alter the meaning, and some explanations could be clearer. The text does not contain excessive redundancy, but the clarity is occasionally compromised by errors.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the gist of the original French podcast, but its quality is uneven due to numerous typographical mistakes, untranslated terms, and lingering French fragments. The readability and fluency are weakened, and technical terminology is not consistently accurate. A more careful proofreading and a tighter focus on fully translating all elements into Spanish would substantially improve the final product. Overall, the translation is serviceable for basic comprehension but requires significant refinement to meet professional standards for Spanish-speaking audiences.\n\nOverall score: 11/20 (average of the individual criteria)."
