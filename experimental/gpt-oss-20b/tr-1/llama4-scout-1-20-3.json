  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable for native speakers. Simple sentences are clear, and the overall structure follows the original flow. However, the translation contains occasional awkward punctuation and breaks in continuity, especially where English fragments are inserted. This slightly hampers readability.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is readable but not fully natural. Several phrases are literal or include untranslated English expressions such as \"You got it right\" or \"The perfect analogy!\". Some sentences have clunky wording and inconsistent verb forms, which detract from the overall flow.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly translated: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\". However, the term \"grounding\" remains untranslated, and the acronym ICL is not fully explained. Consistency is good, but a brief explanation for some terms could improve clarity.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the conversational tone and keeps cultural references intact. Yet, some expressions are directly translated without considering Spanish idiomatic usage, and the mixed‑language snippets may feel jarring for the audience. Minor improvements could make the dialogue feel more native and culturally resonant.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present, and no critical content is omitted. However, the insertion of English fragments introduces slight redundancy, and some nuances (e.g., the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge) are less explicitly emphasized in the Spanish version. Overall, the information remains complete but could be tightened.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core ideas and technical content of the original French script. Readability and terminology are solid, but fluency suffers due to literal translations and embedded English phrases. Contextual adaptation is adequate but could benefit from more natural phrasing. The overall quality is satisfactory for a general audience but would require polishing to achieve a fully native, professional standard. The total score reflects these strengths and weaknesses: 69/100 (or 13.8/20). The translator has done a commendable job, but attention to idiomatic expression and consistency would elevate the text to a higher level of polish and reader friendliness. The scoring and reasoning above detail where improvements could be focused: removing English remnants, smoothing sentence flow, and adding brief explanations for key terms where needed."
