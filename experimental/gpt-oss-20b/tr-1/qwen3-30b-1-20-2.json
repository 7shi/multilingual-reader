  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows a logical flow. However, a few sentences are awkwardly constructed or contain minor syntactic errors (e.g., *« la IA no ha ‘olvidado’ en el sentido humano del término…»*, *« una ficha »*). These issues reduce overall clarity slightly, but the main ideas remain clear. 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally reads naturally, but several expressions feel stilted or non‑idiomatic for native Spanish speakers (e.g., *« una ficha »* for a cheat sheet, *« el espacio de trabajo temporal »*, *« ¿Entonces es un truco? »*). Some words are also unnecessarily capitalised (*Aprendizaje en Contexto*). These quirks lower the fluency rating. 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, grounding* are correctly rendered and consistently used throughout. The translator retains the essential jargon while keeping it accessible for a general audience. 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original intent and tone well, preserving the conversational, informal style and the host‑guest dynamic. Cultural references (e.g., *« gracias por habernos escuchado »*) are appropriate. Minor adjustments (e.g., *« la IA no ha ‘olvidado’…»*) slightly deviate from natural Spanish phrasing, but overall the contextual intent is conveyed. 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present. No significant content is omitted. However, the sentence *« La diferencia entre estudiar de última hora… »* is phrased as a question rather than a statement, which is a minor deviation. The overall message remains intact. 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid overall, faithfully conveying the meaning and technical content of the original French text. Readability and fluency suffer from a few awkward phrasings and minor inaccuracies, but the translation remains understandable and largely natural. Terminology and information completeness are strengths, while contextual adaptation is competent but could be refined to avoid non‑idiomatic expressions. With minor editorial tweaks, the text would read as a polished, native‑level Spanish transcript."
