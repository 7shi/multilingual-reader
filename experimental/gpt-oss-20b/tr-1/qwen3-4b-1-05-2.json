  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation preserves the overall narrative flow and presents the concepts in a fairly logical order. However, there are occasional syntactic awkwardnesses such as “El aprendizaje en contexto, es un bachotaje” and missing articles (e.g., “le presentará” instead of “le presentas”). The dialogue structure remains clear, so readers can follow the conversation without much difficulty. Minor grammatical issues slightly reduce comprehensibility.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several spots where phrasing feels literal or clunky. For instance, “El aprendizaje en contexto, es un bachotaje” and “se le ha dado solo un prompt justo antes de que ella comience a hablar con usted” read like machine‑translated sentences. Vocabulary choices are appropriate, yet some idiomatic expressions could be smoother. Overall, the text is understandable but not fully idiomatic.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *ventana de contexto*, and *In‑Context Learning (ICL)* are translated consistently and correctly. The Spanish equivalents are used properly, and the translation includes the English abbreviation in parentheses, which aids clarity. Minor inconsistencies arise in the use of “fine‑tuning” versus *afinamiento*, but overall terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and conversational tone, and it adapts cultural references reasonably well. Some expressions that work well in French (e.g., “une nouvelle approche” as “una nueva aproximación”) are preserved. However, the Spanish version occasionally feels too literal, and some nuances—like the metaphor of “consultor brillante” versus “consultor brillante”—could be refined to resonate better with Spanish‑speaking audiences.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French transcript is present. No major omissions were detected, and the structure remains faithful to the dialogue. A few sentences are slightly condensed, but this does not compromise clarity. Redundancy is minimal, and the translation remains concise.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material and retains the dialogue’s educational purpose. While readability and terminology are well handled, the fluency suffers from a few literal phrasings and grammatical slips that could be polished for a more natural feel. Overall, the translation is competent but would benefit from a final copy‑editing pass to smooth out awkward expressions and improve stylistic flow. The translation is functional for a native Spanish audience but does not yet reach a native‑speaker level of polish in all areas.\n\nAverage score (out of 20): 16.6 → 17/20\n\n\"score\": 17"
