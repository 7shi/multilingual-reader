    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, but the sentence structure sometimes feels fragmented. There are occasional awkward word orders (e.g., *“la IA no se afinan”*) that can momentarily confuse readers. The explanations of complex ideas are present, yet a few terms are not clearly defined for a lay audience. Overall, the text can be followed but would benefit from smoother flow.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several sentences contain non‑native constructions and missing accents (*‘se afinan’* instead of *se afina*, *‘antisèche’* instead of *‘lista de trucos’*). The dialogue feels conversational, but occasional literal translations (“la IA se acuerda”) sound forced. Vocabulary choice is largely appropriate, yet the rhythm of the Spanish text could be more natural.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved but inconsistently adapted. *Pre‑entrenamiento* is correct, but *fine‑tuning* is left in English and *in‑context learning* is rendered as *aprendizaje en contexto*, which is fine. However, *grounding* is simply translated as *anclaje* without explanation, and the phrase *memoria* is treated as a feature rather than a concept. The term selection is inconsistent in places, lowering technical precision.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original tone and intent, yet some culturally specific nuances are lost. Phrases like *“el modelo en sí mismo no aprende”* could be better localized. Gender pronouns (*ella*) are correctly applied to *IA*, but the use of *‘antisèche’* is a literal borrowing that may not resonate with Spanish speakers. Overall, the adaptation is acceptable but could be more polished for the target audience.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French source are present, including pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, and the memory feature. No critical information is omitted, and redundancy is minimal. Minor explanatory details (e.g., why *grounding* matters) could be expanded, but the core message is intact.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers the essential content and preserves the conversational tone of the original. However, several linguistic inaccuracies and uneven terminology usage affect readability and naturalness. With minor refinements—especially in grammatical consistency and localized expression—the text would achieve a higher level of fluency and clarity for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Overall, the work is solid but still in the intermediate range of quality (≈13/20)."
