    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is fragmented and often incomprehensible. Several lines are missing, replaced with placeholders like \"previous\" or contain incomplete fragments (e.g., \"Camille: previous\", \"Luc: previous\", \"Camille: D'accord\"). The logical flow of the dialogue is broken, making it difficult for a reader to follow the conversation. Only a few short sentences are readable, but the overall structure fails to convey the intended meaning.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences sound awkward or are grammatically incorrect. Phrases such as \"You\" or \"It is\" appear abruptly, and the translation mixes languages (e.g., inserting English words without context). The naturalness expected from a native Spanish speaker is missing; the text reads more like a draft or machine output than a polished translation.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While some key technical terms are correctly rendered (e.g., *aprendizaje en contexto*, *ajuste fino*), many others are omitted or mistranslated. The dialogue includes incomplete translations of phrases like \"I am not forgetting in a human sense\" or \"It simply inserts the excerpt into the prompt\". Consistency is lacking: the same concept is expressed in multiple ways without standardization. Thus the terminology is not adequately handled.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation does not fully preserve the original intent or the cultural nuances of the French podcast. The conversational tone is disrupted, and some expressions that would resonate with Spanish-speaking listeners are missing or replaced with literal but unnatural equivalents. The adaptation fails to consider the target audience’s expectations, resulting in a weak conveyance of the original purpose.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A significant portion of the dialogue is lost: many lines from the original French script are absent, replaced by placeholders or omitted entirely. Consequently, essential explanations (e.g., the difference between ICL and fine‑tuning, the analogy about consulting vs. permanent expertise) are incomplete or missing. The translation adds no helpful clarifications, and redundancy is not managed. The result is a text that lacks the necessary completeness.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "overall_comment": "The provided translation is severely incomplete and contains numerous errors that hinder comprehension, flow, and technical accuracy. It requires substantial revision: the missing sections must be restored, awkward phrasing replaced with idiomatic Spanish, and terminology standardized. Only after a thorough rewrite will the translation achieve acceptable quality for the target audience. Overall, this draft should be considered a starting point rather than a finished product. It is not fit for publication or professional use in its current state. The average score across all criteria is low, indicating that the translation falls far below the desired standard of fluency, readability, and completeness. The translator should re‑examine the entire script, ensuring that each line is fully rendered, contextually adapted, and technically accurate before presenting it to listeners or readers. The result should also reflect the original podcast’s informal yet informative tone and maintain consistent terminology throughout the dialogue. In its present form, the translation is only marginally useful, with significant work required to bring it up to standard."
