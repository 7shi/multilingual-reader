    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows a logical structure that mirrors the original French script. The dialogues flow naturally, and the main ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and memory) are clearly conveyed. Minor readability issues arise from slightly awkward word choices and a few typographical errors (“re aprender” instead of “reaprender”, “Porque” instead of “Por qué”) that do not impede comprehension, but they do detract from a fully polished reading experience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural to a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, some expressions feel clunky or overly literal – for instance, “Entienden perfectamente” for “Vous avez tout compris” or “Eso es exactamente eso” for “C’est tout à fait ça.” There are also grammatical slips (“re aprender” and “Porque”) and inconsistent verb forms. Overall, the prose is smooth but could be refined for a more native rhythm.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally handled correctly. The key concepts – pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory – are translated into their Spanish equivalents. The use of “afinado” for fine‑tuning, “aprendizaje por transferencia,” and “ventana de contexto” is appropriate, though “ajuste fino” might be more common. The abbreviation ICL is kept intact, which is helpful for readers familiar with the English term. Minor inconsistencies include the inconsistent use of quotation marks, but the terminology itself remains clear and consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator has largely respected Spanish linguistic norms, using “¡Hola y bienvenida a…”, and Spanish idioms. Nonetheless, some cultural adaptations could improve naturalness – for instance, “¡Hola y bienvenidos a…”, “entonces,” “de momento,” etc. The overall intent and purpose of the original text are preserved, and the Spanish audience can appreciate the content without cultural dissonance, but a few phrasing choices are slightly off‑kilter.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No significant information is omitted, and the dialogue order remains intact. The translation includes every key concept and explanatory anecdote. Minor redundancy exists (“Eso es exactamente eso” repeats the idea of the preceding sentence) but it does not obscure meaning. No crucial information is missing, and the text is concise enough for a podcast script.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and largely faithful to the original French script. It preserves the dialogue flow, conveys technical concepts correctly, and remains accessible to a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, some grammatical slips and slightly awkward phrasing reduce the overall polish. With a few refinements—correcting typos, smoothing out idiomatic expressions, and tightening verb forms—the translation would reach a higher standard of fluency and readability."
