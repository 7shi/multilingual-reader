    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable, with clear sentence structure and familiar expressions. However, some lines are missing key words or contain awkward phrasing (e.g., the sentence that mistakenly adds \"el razonamiento y el funcionamiento del mundo en general\"). These small gaps can momentarily confuse the reader. Overall readability is good but not flawless. Score: 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation reads smoothly, but there are several spots where the flow is disrupted. For example, the sentence that begins with \"Porque ya comprende los conceptos generales de gramática\" is incomplete and feels disjointed. Additionally, some sentences end abruptly (\"se apoya en fundamentos extremadamente solid...\") and certain idiomatic expressions are literal and feel slightly unnatural. The overall naturalness is acceptable but there is room for improvement. Score: 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"anclaje\" are correctly rendered and consistently used throughout. The translation stays true to the original terminology and the explanations remain clear. No major mistranslations or omissions of key terms are evident. Score: 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue is adapted for a Spanish-speaking audience with an appropriate level of formality. Cultural references are minimal and the core ideas are preserved. Nevertheless, some expressions could be refined to sound more native (e.g., using \"en contexto\" instead of the literal translation of \"in context\"). The overall intent of the original is conveyed, but a few colloquial touches could enhance relatability. Score: 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several sections are missing content or are incomplete, most notably the line where Camille asks about grammar concepts and the truncated sentence at the end of the fine‑tuning discussion. The omission of these parts reduces the completeness of the translation, causing some ideas to be only partially conveyed. The bulk of the conversation is present, but the lack of a few crucial sentences detracts from full comprehension. Score: 11/20.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is reasonably faithful and readable, but it suffers from a few notable omissions, incomplete sentences, and slightly awkward phrasing. While the technical terminology is handled well and the overall intent is preserved, the translation would benefit from a thorough review to fill in missing parts and polish naturalness. It is a solid draft that could reach a professional standard with some adjustments. Overall, the quality is adequate but not exemplary. Score: 14/20."
