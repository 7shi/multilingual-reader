    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely comprehensible, with most sentences conveying the intended meaning. However, several sentences are awkwardly phrased, overly repetitive, or contain fragments that disrupt the flow. The overall structure follows the original, but the readability is weakened by these issues, earning 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Naturalness suffers from multiple instances of literal translation and unidiomatic wording (e.g., \"Voyez plutôt:\" left in French, \"Aprendizaje In-Contexto\" instead of the established term ICL). Some grammar mistakes and abrupt transitions further reduce fluency, resulting in a 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered (e.g., \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ajuste fino\"). The major misstep is the substitution of \"AIC\" for ICL, and occasional omissions of parenthetical explanations that could aid comprehension. Consistency is largely maintained, so 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the overall tone and intent but fails to fully adapt to Spanish-speaking audiences in a few spots (the French phrase left intact, the use of \"Aprendizaje In-Contexto\" which is not widely recognized). Cultural nuance is otherwise preserved, hence 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Essential information from the original is largely preserved, with no major omissions. A small amount of redundancy appears due to repeated lines (e.g., the repeated \"Es exactamente eso.\"), but the core content remains intact. 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation communicates the core ideas but is hindered by several awkward phrasings, an incorrect terminology substitution, and the retention of a French phrase. With targeted revisions to smooth the prose, correct ICL terminology, and eliminate repetition, the translation would rise to a higher quality tier."
