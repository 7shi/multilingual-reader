  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows a clear sentence‑order.  Minor issues such as the retention of the French word *ancrage* and the odd construction *del bachotage* slightly hinder readability, but the overall message remains graspable by a native speaker.  Score: 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation flows well overall, but there are several unnatural or incorrect expressions: *el concepto de ancrage*, *del bachotage*, *cramer* (should be *crammer* or a Spanish equivalent).  These moments interrupt the natural rhythm of the dialogue, reducing fluency.  Score: 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are accurately rendered (*preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje en contexto*).  However, the French terms *ancrage* and *cramer* were kept verbatim, which is inappropriate for a Spanish audience.  Consistency overall is good but the mis‑translations reduce precision.  Score: 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator has preserved the conversational tone and cultural references (e.g., mentioning ‘consultor brillante’).  Adaptations are appropriate for Spanish‑speaking listeners, though the few mistranslated terms slightly undermine cultural tailoring.  Score: 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the original are present, and no essential content has been omitted.  The slight redundancy in the explanation of memory is acceptable, and the addition of examples (e.g., “consultor brillante”) enhances clarity.  Score: 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and largely faithful to the original.  It succeeds in conveying the technical concepts and conversational nuance, but it suffers from a handful of mistranslated terms that affect readability and professionalism.  With minor corrections—particularly replacing *ancrage* with *anclaje* and revising *del bachotage*—the text would achieve a higher level of polish and accuracy.  Overall, the work demonstrates a good grasp of both source and target languages, though some refinements are needed to reach a truly professional standard.  Score: 16/20."
