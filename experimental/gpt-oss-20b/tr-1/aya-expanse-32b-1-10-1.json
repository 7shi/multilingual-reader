    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is overall clear and logically structured, mirroring the conversational tone of the original. Sentences are generally concise, and complex ideas such as pre‑training and fine‑tuning are explained in a straightforward manner. Minor hiccups—like the use of the French term \"antisèche\"—slightly interrupt the flow, but they do not severely hinder understanding. Overall, readers should grasp the content with ease.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally for a native Spanish speaker in most parts, with appropriate vocabulary and sentence construction. However, there are a few awkward choices: \"una antisèche\" is a literal loan from French that feels out of place; a more idiomatic phrase such as \"una referencia rápida\" or \"una anotación\" would be preferable. Additionally, some phrases like \"cuando partes de un contexto vacío\" could be smoothed to \"cuando abres una ventana de conversación vacía\". These minor issues slightly lower fluency, but overall the prose is smooth and natural.",

    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, memoria. The translation uses contemporary terminology that would be familiar to an audience with a basic technical background. Explanations are adequate; the text avoids excessive jargon while preserving the original meaning. Consistency is maintained across the entire script.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the intent and conversational style of the original French script, making it suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are adapted appropriately (e.g., using \"¡Gracias por habernos escuchado!\" instead of a literal translation). The script remains engaging and the humor of the dialogue is kept. Minor cultural nuances—such as the specific phrasing of \"partir de un contexto vacío\"—could be refined, but they do not detract from the overall effect.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present in the translation: the process of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the concept of grounding, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, the explanation of memory features, and the concluding remarks. No critical information is omitted, and the structure remains faithful to the original dialogue. Minor redundancies are not problematic, and the content stays concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, effectively capturing the meaning, tone, and technical content of the original French text. The main area for improvement lies in refining a few awkward phrases and replacing the French loanword \"antisèche\" with a more natural Spanish equivalent. With these minor adjustments, the translation would read seamlessly to a native Spanish audience and maintain the engaging, explanatory nature of the original script."
