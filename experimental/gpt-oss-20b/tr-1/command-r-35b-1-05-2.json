  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely easy to follow. Most sentences keep the same logical flow as the original. Minor issues such as missing accents (¿Por qué?) or slightly awkward phrasing (retraer al IA) reduce clarity but do not prevent understanding. Overall, the reader can grasp the concepts without much effort.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker, but several spots stand out as unnatural or grammatically incorrect: e.g., \"retraer al IA\" instead of \"reentrenar la IA\", \"en coulisses\" left untranslated, and missing accent marks. Vocabulary choices are mostly appropriate, yet some translations (e.g., \"cramming\" to \"el cramming\") feel forced. The overall fluency is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: preentrenamiento, fine-tuning, ICL, grounding, etc. The translator consistently uses the Spanish equivalents and keeps the core meanings intact. Some small inconsistencies exist (e.g., \"refinamiento\" vs. \"fine‑tuning\"), but they don’t confuse the reader. The terminology is therefore accurate and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references reasonably well; the podcast title was localized to \"Tecnología Al Instante\", which makes sense for Spanish listeners. However, the title later reverts to the original French \"Tech Éclair\", creating inconsistency. Phrases like \"en coulisses\" were not translated, which slightly hampers cultural adaptation. Overall, context is preserved, but there is room for improvement.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present. No significant omissions or additions that alter the meaning. Some details are slightly garbled by typos or wrong words, but the information conveyed remains essentially complete. Minor redundancy issues are negligible.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and effectively conveys the original podcast content, but it contains several errors that affect readability and naturalness. Attention to accent marks, correct verb forms, and consistent naming would raise the quality further. The technical terminology is accurate, and the key ideas are preserved. With a few edits, this would be a very polished Spanish version."
