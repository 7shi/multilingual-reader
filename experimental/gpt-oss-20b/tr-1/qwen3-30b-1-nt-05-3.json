  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and follows a logical sentence structure. Phrases such as *“la IA es como un recién graduado”* and *“es como contratar a un consultor brillante”* are clear and mirror the original's conversational tone. However, occasional missing articles (*e.g., “la memoria de corto plazo”* instead of *“la memoria a corto plazo”*) and the abrupt insertion of “o” in *“o « ventana de contexto »”* slightly interrupt flow. Overall, the text is readable but could benefit from a few small syntactic fixes.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker, with most expressions sounding natural. Minor fluency issues arise with phrases like *“la memoria de corto plazo”* (missing *a*) and the awkward *“o « ventana de contexto »”* which could be simply *“la ventana de contexto”*. Vocabulary choices are contemporary and appropriate. The overall naturalness remains high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *ICL* are all suitable. The phrase *“ajuste fino”* is a good Spanish equivalent of *fine‑tuning*. The main inconsistency is the switch between *memoria a corto plazo* and *memoria de corto plazo*. Consistent use of *memoria a corto plazo* would improve accuracy.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and conversational tone while adapting idioms for Spanish audiences (e.g., *“es como contratar a un consultor brillante”*). Cultural references are neutral and appropriate. The adaptation of *“ICL (In‑Context Learning)”* as *“Aprendizaje en Contexto (ICL)”* could be made clearer, but overall the contextual adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present. No significant content has been omitted. The translator sometimes added clarifying phrases (e.g., *“aprender a montar bicicleta”*) that aid comprehension without introducing redundancy.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality and faithfully conveys the meaning, tone, and nuance of the original French text. Minor adjustments are needed for consistency in terminology and a few syntactic refinements to enhance naturalness. Once those are addressed, the translation would be considered excellent for a native Spanish-speaking audience."
