  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version retains the clear, conversational structure of the original. Sentences are generally easy to follow, and complex ideas such as pre‑training and in‑context learning are explained with familiar analogies. Minor awkward phrasing (e.g., \"en el podcast\" instead of \"a el podcast\") does not hinder comprehension, so the overall readability is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker, with appropriate colloquial expressions like \"vamos a revelar\" and \"aprenderá el francés a una velocidad increíble.\" However, there are small grammatical quirks (e.g., using \"en\" instead of \"a\" in the greeting, occasional future tense where present would be more natural). These do not break the flow but slightly reduce naturalness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely translated correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"IA\", and \"anclaje\". Consistency is maintained throughout, and the terminology is appropriate for a general audience. Minor alternative choices (e.g., \"ajuste fino\" for fine‑tuning) could improve precision, but overall terminology is handled well.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original intent and cultural references effectively. The use of Spanish idioms and conversational tone matches the original French style. Small errors in prepositions and exclamation marks do not alter the meaning, so contextual adaptation is strong.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original script are present: the process of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, short‑term memory, and the new \"memory\" feature. No critical information is omitted, and the translation remains concise while preserving nuance.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, conveying the original content accurately and naturally. Minor grammatical and stylistic issues slightly lower the score, but the overall message remains clear and engaging for Spanish‑speaking listeners. The translation would benefit from a few fine‑tuning adjustments in prepositions and tense consistency to achieve near‑flawless fluency."
