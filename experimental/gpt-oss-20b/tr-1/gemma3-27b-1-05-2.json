  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the overall sentence structure of the original French dialogue and conveys the intended meaning in a clear, easily understandable way. Paragraphs and speaker turns are neatly marked, and the use of everyday language makes the concepts accessible to a general audience. Some sentences are slightly long, but the logical flow remains intact. Minor repetitions (e.g., the phrase *« Lo has entendido todo. »* appears twice but does not impede comprehension.) Overall, the text is readable and comprehensible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker. Idiomatic expressions and punctuation are largely appropriate, and there are no major grammatical errors. Some phrases could be polished further—e.g., *« Lo has entendido todo. »* feels slightly literal, and the repeated exclamation marks can appear a bit forceful—but overall the text sounds natural and fluid.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally well‑translated: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto* (ICL). Consistency is maintained throughout. The one notable slip is the use of the English word *grounding* instead of a Spanish equivalent (*anclaje* or *enraizamiento*). This is a minor inconsistency but does not hinder understanding.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue keeps the same conversational tone and cultural references of the original French. Spanish idioms and expressions fit the target audience, and there is no cultural mismatch. Adaptation of the title to *« Tech Éclair »* preserves the original name, which is fine if the show is intended for a Spanish‑speaking audience. No additional localization was needed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All segments of the original script are present, including speaker cues, rhetorical questions, and explanations. No key information is omitted, and the Spanish version remains concise while adding slight clarifications in a few places. Redundancy is minimal, and the translation is faithful to the source content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, accurately conveying the technical concepts and maintaining the conversational flow of the original French script. Minor refinements—especially around the use of the term *grounding* and slight polishing of some repetitive phrases—would bring the text to near‑perfect status. Overall, the Spanish version is clear, fluent, and faithful to the source."
