  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely understandable and follows a logical sentence structure. However, a few passages—such as the literal translation of “in‑Context Learning” and the phrase “una especie de estudiar a vapor”—feel slightly awkward and may momentarily confuse a casual reader. Overall, the dialogue remains clear but could benefit from smoother phrasing in a few spots.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the text flows naturally for a native speaker, but the retention of English terms like ICL, ‘grounding’, and the untranslated French word ‘ancrage’ interrupts the rhythm. Some idiomatic choices (“es una especie de estudiar a vapor”) are clunky. The overall style is conversational but could be polished to avoid these hiccups.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “fine‑tuning” (“afinar”) and “pre‑training” are correctly rendered. The treatment of “in‑Context Learning” and “grounding” remains partially untranslated, which may hinder comprehension for a purely Spanish‑speaking audience. Nevertheless, the terminology is generally appropriate and consistent where applied.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the intent and purpose of the original French script. Cultural references (e.g., consultant analogy) are preserved. Minor mismatches—like keeping the French word ‘ancrage’—diminish the adaptation slightly but do not change meaning. The overall cultural tone is suitable for Spanish listeners.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French source is present. No significant omissions or additions are made. The only minor omission is the lack of a Spanish equivalent for “in‑Context Learning” and “grounding,” but these do not detract from comprehension. The text is concise and avoids unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and largely faithful to the original French text, capturing its conversational tone and technical content. Nonetheless, it suffers from a few awkward phrasings and incomplete localization of technical terms, which slightly impede fluency and readability. With minor refinements—especially in translating specialized terminology and smoothing some idiomatic expressions—the translation could reach a higher standard of naturalness and precision for a Spanish-speaking audience. Overall, it is a solid translation that communicates the core ideas effectively but would benefit from further polishing for a fully native reading experience. 16/20 points overall."
