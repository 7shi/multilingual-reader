  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, but there are a few grammatical slips and slightly awkward phrases that can momentarily confuse readers. For instance, “Lee una cantidad masiva de datos” is a correct singular verb, yet the surrounding context feels a bit abrupt. Some sentence structures are less fluid than native‑Spanish prose, but overall the narrative remains clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly smoothly, but several expressions feel literal or clunky—e.g., “en un momento de la vida” is missing, “Se le proporciona una hoja de respuestas justo antes” feels unnatural, and “una hoja de respuestas” might be better rendered as “una pista” or “una tabla de respuestas.” The overall rhythm is acceptable, yet these quirks lower naturalness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: preentrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje (grounding), memoria. No important jargon is omitted, and the terminology matches contemporary Spanish usage in AI discourse.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references are adapted appropriately for a Spanish audience (e.g., using “consultor” and “experto”), and the narrative flow remains consistent. Minor stylistic adjustments could improve localization, but overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the final discussion on temporary vs. permanent knowledge. No essential content is omitted; redundancy is minimal.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the core message and technical concepts with good fidelity. While readability and fluency are strong, some literal wording and minor grammatical inconsistencies detract from a fully polished native‑Spanish text. With a few stylistic refinements—especially in phrasing naturalness—the translation would reach a higher level of fluency without sacrificing technical accuracy or contextual adaptation. Overall, it is a solid, comprehensible rendition suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners familiar with AI terminology, but it could benefit from a final copy‑editing pass to smooth out the remaining quirks and enhance natural flow. The final scores reflect a strong translation that is functional and accurate, yet leaves room for improvement in fluidity and stylistic polish."
