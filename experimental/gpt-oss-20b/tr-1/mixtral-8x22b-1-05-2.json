  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely understandable and follows the same logical flow as the original. Sentences are mostly well‑structured, though a few are slightly long or lack a small article, which can momentarily disrupt the flow. Overall, a Spanish speaker can follow the conversation without major difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several phrases feel awkward or slightly off. For instance, \"afino\" (should be \"afinamiento\" or \"afinar\") and the use of \"AIC\" instead of \"ICL\" create a jarring mismatch. Minor grammatical issues such as \"Olvídalo todo\" after stating \"ella olvida todo\" also detract from fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\". However, inaccuracies like \"afino\" for fine‑tuning, the wrong acronym \"AIC\", and the mis‑translation of ICL as \"aprendizaje contextual\" undermine consistency and accuracy.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation respects the original intent and uses culturally appropriate references (e.g., \"consultor brillante\"). The overall tone and metaphorical style are preserved. Minor mis‑adaptations (e.g., the erroneous acronym) slightly weaken this score, but the listener’s cultural context is well accommodated.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points of the original are present and the dialogue is largely intact. However, the incorrect acronyms and some awkward phrasing may obscure the precise meaning of ICL, leading to a slight loss of clarity. No major content was omitted, but the precision is not perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the overall meaning and conversational flow of the French original, making it accessible to Spanish speakers. Nevertheless, certain technical terms and acronyms are inaccurately rendered, and some expressions feel slightly unnatural. With a few adjustments—especially correcting the terminology for fine‑tuning and ICL—the translation would achieve a higher level of quality and precision. As it stands, it provides a clear, mostly fluent version that can be understood by the target audience but would benefit from a final proofread to refine terminology and consistency, elevating it from competent to excellent quality. The overall score reflects solid performance with room for improvement in technical accuracy and natural phrasing. Overall score: 15/20."
