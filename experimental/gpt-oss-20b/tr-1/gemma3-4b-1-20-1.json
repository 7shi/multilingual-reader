  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, but several sentences are oddly constructed or contain missing articles, which can momentarily confuse the reader. Overall, the flow is acceptable but could be smoother.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation feels somewhat mechanical. Some expressions such as \"enviar una nueva IA a la escuela\" and \"el afinado\" are literal and not natural Spanish. There are also minor grammatical inconsistencies (e.g., missing accents, subject‑verb agreement in a few places). The text is intelligible, but native readers may find it a bit stilted.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly translated correctly—\"pre-entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\". However, the French word \"ancrage\" is left unchanged, and the choice between \"ajuste fino\" and \"afinado\" is inconsistent. These errors reduce the precision of the technical language.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue style and cultural references are preserved, and the opening greeting is adapted to Spanish. Some idiomatic adjustments could improve clarity, but the overall intent and tone are retained. Minor mismatches (e.g., using \"enviar\" instead of a more natural phrase) are present.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant omissions are noted, and the explanation of concepts like ICL and memory remains intact. Redundancies are minimal, though some explanations are slightly more condensed than the French version.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the gist of the original and is largely readable, but it suffers from some terminology inaccuracies and awkward phrasing that diminish its naturalness and precision. A revision focusing on consistent technical terms and smoother sentence construction would raise the quality substantially."
