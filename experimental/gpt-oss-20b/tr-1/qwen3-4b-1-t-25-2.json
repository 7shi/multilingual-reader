  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally easy to read for Spanish speakers. Sentences are mostly short and the flow is logical. However, some awkward word choices (e.g., \"la IA no se afinan\", “conocer la misma informaciones”) and the presence of English terms like \"fine‑tuning\" and \"prompt\" interrupt the natural flow, slightly reducing readability. Overall, the content is still understandable but would benefit from minor polishing.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are several instances where the phrasing feels forced or unidiomatic. The retained English terms \"fine‑tuning\" and \"prompt\" are not fully integrated into Spanish style, and the sentence \"la IA no se afinan\" contains a grammatical error that affects fluency. Despite these issues, the majority of the dialogue reads smoothly.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", and \"anclaje\" are correctly rendered. The main exception is \"fine‑tuning\", which is left in English, and the occasional use of \"prompt\" instead of a Spanish equivalent. The terminology is consistent elsewhere, making this criterion relatively strong.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone suitable for a podcast. Cultural references are adequately adapted, and the dialogue maintains a friendly, explanatory style. Minor issues arise from the English terms that could feel out of place for a Spanish audience, slightly affecting contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant information has been omitted, and the narrative structure is intact. A few grammatical errors and untranslated terms do not materially affect the conveyed information, so the translation remains comprehensive.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "La traducción es mayormente fiel al original y comprensible, pero contiene algunos errores gramaticales y el uso de términos en inglés que podrían mejorarse. Con pequeños ajustes y una revisión de los términos no traducidos, alcanzaría una calidad excelente para su público hispanohablante."
