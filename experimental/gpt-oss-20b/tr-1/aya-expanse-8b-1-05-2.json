  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, but several sentences suffer from awkward phrasing, literal word‑for‑word translations, and occasional punctuation errors that interrupt the flow. Concepts such as pre‑training and fine‑tuning are conveyed, yet the reader may need to re‑read a few lines to grasp the intended meaning. Overall, the text is readable but not smooth. 12/20",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural expressions and grammatical mistakes (e.g., \"Aprendizaje por Computadora\" instead of \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\", the accent on \"comenzás\", the incorrect use of quotation marks, and a mistranslated episode title). These errors make the text feel forced and less natural for a native Spanish speaker. 10/20",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly correctly translated (e.g., \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"anclaje\", \"memoria\"), but there are notable inconsistencies and mistakes. The term \"In‑Context Learning\" is rendered as \"Aprendizaje por Computadora\", which is inaccurate. Some explanations are missing or unclear, reducing overall consistency. 12/20",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the conversational tone but fails to fully adapt to the target culture in a few places. The episode title was incorrectly changed to \"Tech Claridad\" instead of keeping the original play on words. Some idiomatic expressions are awkward and not fully localized. 11/20",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French dialogue are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, context window, ICL, grounding, memory, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. Minor omissions or paraphrases do not significantly alter the meaning. 14/20",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core ideas but is hindered by several lexical inaccuracies, grammatical mistakes, and a lack of natural flow. It would benefit from a thorough proof‑reading to correct terminology, improve sentence structure, and preserve the original branding of the podcast. With those corrections, the quality would rise to a professional standard, but as it stands it falls short of a polished, native‑level translation. The overall performance is adequate for an intermediate understanding but not ideal for native consumption or official use. The cumulative score is 59/100, reflecting the need for significant refinement in fluency, terminology accuracy, and contextual adaptation while retaining readability and completeness. "
