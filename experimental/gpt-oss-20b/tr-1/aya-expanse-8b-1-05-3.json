    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow, and the overall narrative structure mirrors the original. Some sentences are slightly long, and a few phrases (“una idea de lo que se dijo antes”, “aprendizaje por computadora”) feel awkward or incorrect, which can momentarily hinder comprehension. Overall, the listener would understand the content without major effort.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads quite smoothly, with correct verb conjugations and appropriate everyday vocabulary. Nevertheless, there are a handful of unnatural expressions—e.g., “la IA no tiene una idea de lo que se dijo antes” and “la IA no ‘ha olvidado’ en el sentido humano” – that could be polished for native fluency. The use of some capitalizations (e.g., “Memoria”) also feels slightly out of place.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are translated accurately: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje en contexto*. The word *grounding* becomes *anclaje*, which is acceptable, though a brief definition would improve clarity. The main issue is the mistaken translation of ICL as “Aprendizaje por Computadora” in one sentence, which misrepresents the concept. Overall consistency is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and tone, maintaining the conversational, explanatory style. Cultural references remain appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor improvements could be made to idiomatic expressions (“una idea de lo que se dijo antes” → “no recuerda lo que se dijo antes”), but the adaptation is largely effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is present, and the translation does not omit any key points. A small redundancy occurs with repeated explanations of ICL, but this does not compromise clarity. The erroneous term “Aprendizaje por Computadora” slightly misleads but does not entirely remove information. Thus the content remains largely complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation delivers a clear, mostly faithful rendition of the French original. It handles complex concepts well and keeps the conversational tone. However, minor inaccuracies—particularly with the ICL terminology—and some awkward phrasing slightly detract from an otherwise high‑quality job. With a few refinements, this translation would be polished and fully native‑level. Overall, it demonstrates a solid grasp of both language and subject matter, suitable for a general audience interested in AI fundamentals. The score reflects a strong performance that could reach perfection with minor corrections to terminology and idiomatic flow. "
