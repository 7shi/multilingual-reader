  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is easy to follow and the sentence structure is logical. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in a straightforward way. Some long sentences could be split for even smoother reading, but overall the script remains comprehensible to a general audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a Spanish‑speaking listener. There are a few minor stylistic quirks (e.g., \"es una forma ingeniosa\" instead of the more common \"astuta\" or \"útil\"), but these do not impede understanding. Grammar is generally correct and the vocabulary is contemporary, though a few colloquial words like \"chuleta\" could feel informal depending on the target demographic.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are translated correctly (e.g., \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\"). Consistency is maintained throughout the script. Explanations for more complex concepts are provided in plain language, which is appropriate for a general audience. Minor improvement could be made by using \"competencia\" instead of \"habilidad\" in one place, but this is a small detail.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the intent of the original French dialogue and adapts idiomatic expressions to Spanish culture (e.g., comparing the model to a recent university graduate). The use of Spanish equivalents for French expressions (e.g., \"ajuste fino\" for \"affinage\") is appropriate. The script remains engaging and maintains the conversational tone suitable for a podcast audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original script is present; there are no omitted concepts. The translation keeps the same structure and length, avoiding unnecessary redundancy. Small editorial additions (e.g., clarifying that the model does not learn from conversations) are beneficial for comprehension without changing the original meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality: it preserves the meaning, tone, and structure of the original French text while making it accessible to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic tweaks would elevate the fluency further, but the current version is ready for publication in a podcast script."
