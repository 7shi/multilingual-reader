  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely comprehensible, but a few sentences have awkward phrasing that can momentarily confuse readers (e.g., “partes de un contexto vacío”). Overall, the dialogue structure remains clear and the concepts are explained in a way that most Spanish‑speaking listeners can follow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The flow is generally smooth, with most expressions sounding natural. Minor issues include the informal use of “chuleta” and the slightly clunky sentence “partes de un contexto vacío.” The overall style is conversational, matching a podcast transcript.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are translated appropriately: ‘preentrenamiento’, ‘afinamiento’, ‘aprendizaje por transferencia’, ‘aprendizaje en contexto’ (ICL) and ‘memoria’ are all correct and consistent. No key terms are missing or mistranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and adapts idioms to Spanish (e.g., using “consultor brillante” instead of literal word‑for‑word). Cultural nuances are respected; only minor informalities might affect formality in some contexts.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All parts of the original dialogue are present, with no substantive omissions. The translation does not add extraneous content and keeps the script concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and faithful to the source, with high readability, fluent Spanish, accurate terminology, good cultural adaptation, and complete information. A few phrasing quirks could be polished, but overall it serves its purpose well."
