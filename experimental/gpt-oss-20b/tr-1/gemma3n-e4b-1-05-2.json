    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and logically ordered, making it easy for readers to follow the dialogue and the technical explanations. Some minor issues—such as the phrase “reentrenar la IA” or the slightly convoluted sentence about the memory space being emptied—could be smoothed out, but overall the flow is understandable.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for Spanish speakers, with most expressions and vocabulary being idiomatic. However, a few awkward or overly literal choices (e.g., “reentrenar la IA”, “simplemente se ha vaciado su espacio de trabajo temporal”) slightly reduce the smoothness. The overall tone is conversational, matching a podcast script, but a handful of phrases could be refined for greater naturalness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally handled correctly: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", and \"anclaje\" for grounding. The acronym ICL is kept, which is acceptable for a Spanish audience that may recognize it from the original. Consistency is good, and where a term may be unfamiliar, a brief explanation is implicit in the context. Minor improvements could involve expanding or briefly clarifying ICL or grounding early on, but the overall terminology usage is appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the intent and purpose of the original dialogue, adapting cultural references appropriately for Spanish-speaking listeners. The conversational style, use of colloquial expressions like \"un consultor brillante\", and the humor in comparing learning to a consultant fit well with the target audience. No significant cultural misunderstandings or awkward adaptions are present.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No major information is omitted, and the content is concise without unnecessary repetition. Small nuances—such as the explanation that the model uses temporary memory—are kept. The translation does not add extraneous details that would distract from the original message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high quality, accurately conveying the technical content and the conversational tone of the original French script. Minor refinements could improve fluency and reduce some awkward phrasing, but overall the Spanish version is clear, natural, and faithful to the source material. The translation effectively serves its purpose as a podcast script for Spanish-speaking audiences."
