  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The sentences are mostly short and follow a clear logical order, mirroring the original dialogue. Complex concepts such as pre‑training and in‑context learning are explained with straightforward language, making the text accessible to a general Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor run‑on sentences could be split for even greater clarity, but overall the piece is easy to understand.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for native speakers, with most idiomatic expressions natural. Some phrases feel slightly literal – e.g., \"una hoja de trucos\" and \"las informaciones\" – but they do not hinder comprehension. Occasional word choices like \"afinado\" could be replaced with \"ajuste fino\" for a more common technical register, yet the overall flow remains fluent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", and \"ventana de contexto\". Consistency is maintained throughout, and the translator provides explanations when necessary, ensuring the target audience grasps the concepts.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue keeps the original intent and humor while respecting cultural expectations of Spanish‑speaking listeners. Expressions like “consultor brillante” and “proyecto en curso” fit the context, and references to memory and learning are appropriately adapted. Minor tweaks could improve cultural resonance, but no major misalignments exist.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All utterances from the French script are present; no essential information is omitted. The Spanish version includes the same explanations and examples, preserving the structure and depth of the original. Redundancy is kept at a reasonable level, and the text stays concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is highly faithful to the original, capturing its technical details, conversational tone, and overall meaning. While a few phrases could be polished for more naturalness, the Spanish rendition is clear, fluent, and well‑adapted for its intended audience. Minor style improvements would elevate it to a near‑perfect level, but it already serves as an excellent, reliable translation of the podcast script. "
