    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable to native speakers. The dialogue structure is clear and most concepts are conveyed in a comprehensible way. However, there are a few awkward sentences (e.g., “Lo olvida todo.” is a terse translation that loses the explanatory nuance of the original French) and duplicated speaker labels (“Camille: Camille:” and “Luc: Luc:”) that interrupt the flow and reduce readability.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall, the text reads smoothly, but several phrases are slightly unnatural or overly literal (e.g., “El ajuste fino” is fine, but “El modelo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus conversaciones” sounds clunky). The grammar is generally correct, yet some word choices (e.g., “informaciones” instead of the singular “información”) give the translation a slightly stilted feel.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled appropriately: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\". Minor inconsistencies (e.g., “IA” is kept instead of the more common “modelo de IA”) do not detract significantly, but overall terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural adaptation is minimal because the content is technical, but the translator has largely avoided literal word-for-word rendering where it would be awkward. The few literal passages (e.g., the repeated speaker tags) slightly hurt cultural adaptation but are not pervasive.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original transcript are present. There is no omission of technical explanations or narrative elements. The only potential redundancy is the duplicated speaker labels, which could be removed for conciseness, but the core information remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of both the technical content and the Spanish language. While readability and fluency could benefit from a more careful edit of duplicated labels and some phrasing, the terminology is precise, and the essential information is faithfully conveyed. With minor refinements, this version would be ready for publication to a Spanish-speaking audience interested in AI concepts and podcast content. Overall, the translation is competent but not perfect, reflecting a score of 16/20 as an aggregate rating of the individual criteria scores (15+14+18+16+18)/5 ≈ 16."
