  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is heavily fragmented and contains numerous incomplete sentences, abrupt cuts, and placeholder text (e.g., \"Luc: totalmente nueva/o\", \"Camille: …\").  Readers will find it hard to follow the dialogue and grasp the flow of ideas, especially where crucial transitions and explanations are missing. The overall structure is unclear, lowering readability to a modest 5/20.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains many awkward phrasing and grammatical errors. Sentences such as \"Luc: totalmente nueva/o\" or “Luc: aprendizaje a corto plazo” are not natural Spanish expressions. The mix of French fragments, English terms, and broken syntax makes the translation feel disjointed and unnatural, deserving 4/20.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms like *pre‑entrenamiento*, *fin‑tuning* and *aprendizaje por transferencia* appear at times, but the translation frequently switches to literal or incorrect renditions (e.g., “learning in context” is partially left in English). Moreover, many technical concepts are omitted or poorly explained. Consistency and accuracy are lacking, so 6/20.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to adapt the original conversational tone for a Spanish-speaking audience. Cultural references and idiomatic expressions are missing or misused, and the abrupt inclusion of editorial comments (the long explanatory block) breaks immersion. The adaptation score is therefore low, 4/20.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original script are missing or replaced with placeholders. Key explanatory parts about how fine‑tuning and ICL work are omitted, and the final conclusion is truncated. The translation therefore conveys only a fraction of the original information, meriting 3/20.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is incomplete and riddled with errors. It loses the flow, technical clarity, and naturalness of the original script, making it difficult for native speakers to understand the content. Substantial revision and a thorough, faithful rewrite are required to achieve a usable translation.\n\nScore: 5/20 (average of the five criteria).   \n\nThe overall score reflects a translation that is far from acceptable for professional or educational use. The work needs a comprehensive overhaul to correct omissions, improve fluency, and properly convey the technical concepts presented in the source text.  \n\nOverall, the quality of the translation is poor, and it would not meet the needs of the target audience without significant rewriting."
