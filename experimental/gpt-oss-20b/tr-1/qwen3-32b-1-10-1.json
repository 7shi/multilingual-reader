  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentence structure mirrors the original dialogue and the progression of ideas is logical. However, some sentences are a bit long and could be broken up for easier skimming, especially for casual listeners. Overall, readers can grasp the concepts without confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly and sounds natural to native Spanish speakers. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary. A few minor phrasings feel slightly literal (e.g., \"le proporciona la información que necesita para la tarea a realizar\"), but they do not hinder understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly translated and consistently used: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\", and the abbreviation ICL is retained. Explanations for complex concepts are present where needed.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the cultural and linguistic context of Spanish-speaking audiences. Expressions are adapted to avoid Frenchisms, and the dialogue feels natural. Minor improvements could be made to tailor some idiomatic phrases, but overall it works well.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French script are present. There are no significant omissions, and the translation keeps the content concise while retaining essential details. A few nuances about the internal workings of the \"Memory\" feature could be expanded slightly, but the current level of detail is adequate for general comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is high‑quality, faithful, and readable. It effectively conveys the technical concepts and dialogue flow of the original French podcast while sounding natural in Spanish. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency further, but the current version serves its purpose well for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
