  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally follows the original structure and uses clear, everyday Spanish, which makes the concepts accessible. However, some sentences are unnecessarily long and contain parenthetical fragments (e.g., “La gran pregunta para quien use estos herramientas es: ¿Necesito un consultor temporal o un experto permanente?”) that slightly disrupt the flow. Minor clarifications (e.g., adding “de estas herramientas” after “usadas”) would improve comprehensibility. Overall, the text is understandable but could benefit from tighter syntax.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The prose sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward or literal phrasings that would feel odd to native speakers, such as “la gran pregunta para quien use estos herramientas” (missing article) and “se le ha ‘olvidado’” where a Spanish equivalent would be “se ha olvidado”. Some expressions like “una gran pregunta” or “en esta reflexión” could be smoothed. The mix of formal and informal register (e.g., “¡Vale!” vs. “Gracias por escucharnos”) creates an inconsistent tone.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved, but inconsistencies appear: “pre-entrenamiento” is correctly used, yet later the text switches between “affinage” and “fine-tuning” without Spanish equivalents. The concept of “in‑context learning” is translated as “aprendizaje en contexto” correctly, but the abbreviation ICL is never introduced in Spanish. Some specialized terms such as “grounding” remain in English. Overall, terminology is understandable but could be more consistent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and conversational style, but it sometimes introduces extraneous commentary (e.g., “Justification for translation choices” inserted mid‑dialogue) that was not in the source. Cultural references to “consultor brillante” are appropriate, but the text occasionally feels disjointed due to those insertions. The adaptation is generally effective, but the extra explanatory notes diminish the narrative flow.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is present, including the key concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. However, several dialogue exchanges are truncated or missing (e.g., Luc’s explanation about the “memory” feature is incomplete), and the added commentary sections disrupt the structure. The overall amount of information is adequate but not fully comprehensive, and some sentences are duplicated or incomplete, reducing clarity.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main ideas and retains much of the original conversational tone, but it is hindered by awkward phrasing, inconsistent terminology, and the insertion of extraneous explanatory notes. A cleaner, more concise version that eliminates the commentary interjections and harmonizes technical terms would significantly improve readability, fluency, and completeness. The current draft is a solid first pass but requires further editing for professional polish and coherence in Spanish audiences. The total score (out of 100) is 72/100, reflecting good overall performance with room for refinement in consistency and stylistic smoothness. Also note that the JSON field 'reasoning' below is a concise explanation of the scoring rationale.  "
