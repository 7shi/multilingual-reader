  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow and the sentence structure is generally logical. The speaker labels are clear and the flow of ideas mirrors the original. Minor typographical errors (e.g., duplicated speaker tags) do not obstruct comprehension, but a few small mistakes (like “la IA no se afinada”) slightly reduce clarity. Overall, readers can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely natural and smooth for a native Spanish speaker. Some awkward phrasing appears in a few places, such as the duplicated “Luc: Luc:” line and the grammatical slip “la IA no se afinada” instead of “no se afina”. These irregularities make the text feel a little mechanical, but they do not make it ungrammatical or hard to read. The vocabulary is contemporary and appropriate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje\", \"memoria a corto plazo\", etc. The terms are explained implicitly by context and no major mistranslations occur. Slight inconsistencies in the use of the word \"memoria\" (once as a feature, once as a concept) are acceptable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational style. Cultural adaptation is minimal but adequate; the Spanish-speaking audience can relate to the analogies used. Some expressions could be slightly more idiomatic (e.g., “una nueva ventana de discusión” could be “una nueva ventana de chat”), but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No critical information is omitted, and the explanation of concepts remains clear. The duplication of speaker tags and the small grammatical slip are the only minor redundancies that do not affect overall completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and faithful to the source text, delivering a clear and understandable Spanish version that maintains the original tone and structure. Minor typographical and grammatical errors slightly lower fluency, but these do not impede comprehension. With a few polish‑up edits (removing duplicate speaker tags, correcting the small verb mistake), the text would achieve near‑perfect quality."
