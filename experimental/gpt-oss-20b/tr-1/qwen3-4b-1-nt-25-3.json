  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely understandable for Spanish‑speaking readers, with clear paragraph breaks and logical flow. However, some sentences are awkwardly phrased (e.g., \"se envía una IA… para que le den una cultura general\"), which can momentarily confuse the reader. The use of everyday language and avoidance of overly technical jargon make the content approachable.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The overall cadence feels natural, but there are several grammatical slips and unnatural word choices: \"se envía\" instead of \"se envía a\", \"antiespuesta\" (a literal but nonsensical translation of ‘cheat sheet’), and repeated phrasing that sounds forced. The translation would benefit from a smoother flow and more idiomatic Spanish.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" (translated as \"anclaje\") and \"ventana de contexto\" are correctly rendered and consistent. Nevertheless, the phrase \"bachotage\" was mistakenly left in French, and the translation of the French idiom “bachotage” into Spanish was not handled. Additionally, the word \"antiespuesta\" is inappropriate and confusing.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent of the original French script is preserved, and cultural references are suitably adapted for a Spanish audience. Minor adjustments (e.g., localizing idioms like \"un experto\" instead of literal translations) are mostly well done, though the translator missed a few opportunities to make the script feel more native.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the source text appear in the Spanish version, including pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, and the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge. Some details (such as the precise explanation of \"bachotage\") were either omitted or incorrectly rendered, but no essential information is lost.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main ideas and is largely comprehensible, but it suffers from a few significant linguistic inaccuracies and a couple of literal mistranslations that affect clarity and professionalism. With minor revisions—especially correcting the term \"antiespuesta\", replacing \"bachotage\" with an appropriate Spanish equivalent, and smoothing some awkward phrasing—the text would reach a high level of quality for native speakers. The overall score reflects solid performance but leaves room for improvement in terminology and fluency aspects. The final score is 15 out of 20, reflecting a competent but not flawless translation. Please revise the noted issues for a more polished result. The translator should also double‑check French idioms and ensure all technical terms are properly adapted to Spanish terminology. "
