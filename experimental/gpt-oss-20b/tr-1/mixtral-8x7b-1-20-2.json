  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish transcript is largely clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured, and the dialogue flow is preserved. Minor typographical mistakes such as missing accents (¿Porque vs ¿Por qué?) and a misspelled word (conocimencias) slightly disrupt readability, but overall the text remains comprehensible to native Spanish readers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most expressions sound natural and the vocabulary is appropriate for a general audience. However, some word choices feel slightly literal (e.g., \"desvelaremos la tecnología\" instead of a more idiomatic \"descubriremos la tecnología\"). There are a few minor grammatical slips (missing accents, punctuation errors). The translation reads smoothly overall, but these small issues lower the fluency slightly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL) are correctly rendered. The translation keeps key French terms in Spanish and provides clear explanations where needed. The term \"grounding\" is rendered as \"ancramiento\" and \"enlace\", which are acceptable, though \"anclaje\" could be more common. No major terminology errors are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and cultural references intact, adapting idioms where necessary. The main issue is the inconsistent naming of the podcast at the end (“Tech Flash” instead of “Tech Éclair”), which may confuse listeners. Aside from that, the adaptation is effective and culturally appropriate for Spanish‑speaking audiences.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the information from the original French transcript is included; no concepts are omitted. The content remains concise and clear, with no unnecessary repetition. The only omission is the name change at the end, which does not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and conveys the meaning and tone of the original podcast. Minor linguistic inaccuracies and a small inconsistency in the podcast title slightly diminish the quality, but the text remains understandable, technically accurate, and well‑adapted for a Spanish‑speaking audience. With a few corrections, it would reach a very high standard of translation quality."
