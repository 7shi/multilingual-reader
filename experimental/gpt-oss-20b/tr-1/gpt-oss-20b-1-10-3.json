  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation follows a clear sentence structure and is largely understandable to a Spanish-speaking audience. However, some sentences are slightly awkward or overly literal, e.g., \"Tú has entendido todo.\" which can confuse readers. Overall, the content is comprehensible, but small readability issues reduce the score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text mostly reads smoothly, but there are several grammatical slips and unnatural phrasing: \"Tú has entendido todo\", missing articles in \"proporcionarle los documentos\", and inconsistent use of capitalization. These errors affect the natural flow for native speakers. The vocabulary is appropriate, but polish is needed for full fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly translated: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\", etc. The usage is consistent throughout the dialogue. Minor issues include the occasional misspelling or redundant parenthetical, but overall terminology handling is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational tone and informal address are preserved. Cultural adaptation is adequate, though the translation could benefit from a slightly more natural Spanish idiom in a few places (e.g., avoiding “Tú has entendido todo”). The original intent is largely maintained, and the podcast feel is retained.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the original content is present in the translation. No significant omissions or additions. The dialogue flows logically and the key explanations are retained, making the translation information‑complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is good overall and captures the gist of the original French dialogue. It effectively conveys the technical concepts and the conversational style. However, it suffers from a few grammatical mistakes and unnatural phrasing that detract from perfect fluency. With minor editing, the translation could achieve near‑native quality. The most notable strengths are the accurate terminology and complete information transfer, while the main weaknesses lie in small readability and fluency issues that should be addressed before publication or broadcast. The translation is ready for a general audience but would benefit from a final proofread to smooth out the awkward constructions and correct minor errors. Overall, a solid effort that meets most of the evaluation criteria, with room for polish in the final touches to achieve a fully natural, reader‑friendly Spanish version of the podcast script."
