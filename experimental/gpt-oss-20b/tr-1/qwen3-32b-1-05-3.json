    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is easy to follow for a Spanish-speaking audience. Sentences are generally well-structured and complex concepts are explained clearly, though a few phrases (e.g., \"se envía una muy nueva IA\" and \"una IA muy nueva\") feel slightly awkward. The dialogue format helps readability.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally overall, but there are minor fluency issues: missing accent in \"¿Porque\" (should be \"¿Por qué\"), wrong article in \"El IA\" vs \"La IA\", and some clumsy phrasing such as \"una IA muy nueva\". These small errors slightly hinder the smoothness of the text.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"in-context learning\". The Spanish equivalent for \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\" is appropriate. Minor slip in \"Las nuevas conocimientos\" (should be \"Los nuevos conocimientos\"). Overall, terminology is accurate and appropriate.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts idiomatic expressions and cultural references well, maintaining the original intent and tone. Some phrasing could be smoother (e.g., \"se ha hecho posible gracias a la expansión masiva\"), but the adaptation is effective and culturally relevant.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present: pre-training, fine-tuning, in-context learning, memory features, and the consultant vs permanent expert analogy. No critical information is omitted, and the content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality and conveys the original meaning with good clarity and most technical terms correctly rendered. Minor grammatical and orthographic errors slightly reduce fluency, but the overall communication remains effective for a Spanish-speaking audience. A few adjustments (accent corrections, article usage, and small phrasing tweaks) would bring the translation to near-perfect status. Overall, a solid translation with only minor room for polish, suitable for a professional podcast audience. 89/100 points are warranted for its quality and completeness. 89"
