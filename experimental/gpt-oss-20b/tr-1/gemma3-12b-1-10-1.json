  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is fragmented and often incomplete. Sentences are abruptly cut off, and many paragraphs lack a clear subject‑verb alignment. Readers will find it difficult to follow the logical flow of ideas, especially when key parts of the dialogue are missing or replaced with placeholders (e.g., “…”, “…”). This greatly reduces comprehensibility, scoring it around 7/20.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The language contains numerous awkward constructions, literal word‑for‑word carry‑overs, and residual French terms (“pre-entrenamiento” vs. “pre‑entrenamiento”, “apprentissage en contexte” spelled in French). The overall register feels disjointed and unpolished, with occasional grammatical errors (e.g., missing accents, inconsistent verb agreement). Naturalness is low, warranting a score of 5/20.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *aprendizaje en contexto* (ICL), *ventana de contexto* are present, but their use is inconsistent (sometimes Spanish, sometimes French). Some concepts (e.g., *grounding*, *memory*, *contextual learning*) are missing or only partially rendered. The terminology is therefore not consistently appropriate, meriting 8/20.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation does not fully adapt the original French expressions for a Spanish-speaking audience. Cultural references and idiomatic phrasing are either lost or replaced with literal equivalents that feel unnatural. The adaptation to the target audience is weak, leading to a score of 6/20.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are omitted, truncated, or replaced with ellipses, resulting in missing explanations about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and ICL. The omission of these details compromises the informational integrity of the text. Consequently, it receives a low score of 4/20.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation suffers from incomplete rendering, inconsistent terminology, and a lack of fluency, making it difficult for Spanish readers to grasp the intended message. While some key technical terms are present, the overall coherence and completeness are significantly below acceptable standards for a professional translation. A substantial revision is required to align the text with the original French content and to produce a clear, natural, and fully detailed Spanish version.  Overall, the translation scores 30/100 across the six criteria, indicating a need for major improvement.  In a formal context, this translation would be considered unsuitable for publication without thorough editing and completion."
