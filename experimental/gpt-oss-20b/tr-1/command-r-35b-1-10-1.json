  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and follows the dialogue structure, so listeners can follow the conversation. However, the presence of untranslated English fragments, inconsistent punctuation, and occasional abrupt sentence endings reduce overall clarity. The core ideas are conveyed, but the flow could be smoother.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly natural to a Spanish speaker, but several expressions feel awkward or literal. Phrases like \"Es una memoria de uso único\" and the repeated insertion of English words such as \"Exactly\" disrupt the natural rhythm. Grammar is mostly correct, but punctuation inconsistencies (missing periods, double colons) hinder smoothness.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms such as *pre-entrenamiento* and *aprendizaje en contexto* are correctly translated. Yet *fine‑tuning* is left untranslated in parentheses, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the English term. Additionally, *ICL* is mentioned without an explanation of the acronym. Consistency is generally good but could be improved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation takes into account cultural references (e.g., consulting analogies) and adapts them well. Still, the insertion of English interjections like \"Exactly\" and the direct translation of the French phrase *« l’affinage »* to \"especialización\" feels slightly out of place in a Spanish context. Overall, the intent is preserved but could be more idiomatic.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French text are present. Minor omissions are not evident; however, the additional English commentary (e.g., *Exactly. And this learning begins…*) adds unnecessary content. Redundancy is minimal, but the extra English insertions slightly inflate the text without adding value.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation communicates the main ideas and technical concepts adequately, but it is marred by residual English, some awkward phrasing, and minor inconsistencies in terminology. With careful revision—removing stray English, tightening punctuation, and ensuring consistent translation of technical terms—the text would achieve a higher level of polish and naturalness for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Overall, it is functional but not yet optimal for professional or native‑level publication."
