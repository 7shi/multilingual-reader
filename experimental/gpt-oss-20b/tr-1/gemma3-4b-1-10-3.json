    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, but several sentences are incomplete or truncated (e.g., \"Camille: suelen\" and the abrupt ending after \"Luc: Cuando abre una nueva ventana\"). These gaps hinder comprehension and break the logical flow of the dialogue. The sentence structure is generally correct, yet the omissions force readers to infer missing information, reducing overall readability.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation reads smoothly, but there are awkward phrasing and minor grammatical errors (e.g., \"suelen\" at the start of a sentence, missing verb forms, and inconsistent article usage). The phrase \"Ha entendido todo\" is acceptable, but the overall consistency is undermined by incomplete sections and the abrupt transitions that feel unnatural to a native speaker.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\". However, there are occasional inconsistencies (e.g., mixing \"ajuste fino\" and \"fine-tuning\"), and some terms like \"grounding\" are translated but not consistently applied. The overall terminology handling is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation tries to adapt cultural references and idioms, but some expressions are not fully natural (e.g., \"suelen\", which seems out of place). The content remains true to the original intent, yet the lack of fine-tuned cultural nuance slightly weakens the adaptation. The context is largely preserved, but the phrasing could be improved.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Significant omissions exist: several lines are cut off (the part after \"Luc: Cuando abre una nueva ventana\" and some incomplete speaker tags). Key explanatory segments are missing or truncated, leading to a loss of critical information. While most of the dialogue is present, these gaps compromise completeness.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is understandable but contains noticeable gaps and occasional awkward phrasing. Technical terminology is largely accurate, though consistency could be improved. The most serious issue is the missing or truncated sections, which reduce both completeness and readability. With some polishing and a thorough review to fill the gaps, the translation could reach a higher quality level. As it stands, it meets a basic standard but falls short of a polished, professional translation suitable for an audience fully familiar with the subject matter. Overall, the translation is competent but requires significant refinement to achieve a professional standard in clarity, fluency, and completeness. The final score reflects a moderate performance that highlights areas for improvement, particularly in ensuring the text is fully complete and flows naturally for native readers. The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the content but must address the structural and completeness issues to be truly effective for its intended audience. The final score, averaged across the criteria, is 13/20. This indicates room for improvement, especially in editing for completeness and natural flow, while maintaining accurate terminology and context adaptation. The translation would benefit from a comprehensive proofread and targeted language polishing to elevate its overall quality and reliability for a Spanish-speaking audience."
