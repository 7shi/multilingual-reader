  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows a logical sentence structure. However, some isolated fragments (e.g., the single word “preentrenamiento”) and slightly awkward phrasing make the flow less smooth. The translation retains the overall narrative but could benefit from minor edits for clarity.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences read naturally for a Spanish-speaking audience. Nevertheless, there are a few grammatical slips such as \"son una forma ingeniosa\" instead of \"es una forma ingeniosa\", and the use of \"informaciones\" (plural) where singular would be appropriate. These errors slightly diminish the overall fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinado (fine‑tuning)\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"ventana de contexto\", and \"anclaje (grounding)\" are used consistently. The translation could adopt the more common \"ajuste fino\" instead of \"afinado\" for clarity, but the current choices are acceptable. Overall terminology is appropriate and coherent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and cultural references. It adapts the language to a Spanish-speaking audience without altering meaning. Minor stylistic adjustments (e.g., replacing French idioms with Spanish equivalents) could improve localization, but the adaptation is largely effective.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French script are present in the Spanish version. There are no significant omissions, and the narrative flow remains intact. Minor grammatical errors do not affect the conveyed information. The translation could remove a redundant phrase in the last paragraph, but overall it is complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and communicates the core concepts clearly. While there are a few grammatical slips and occasional awkward phrasing, the text remains readable and faithful to the original. With some polishing—particularly around article usage and verb agreement—the translation would reach a higher standard of fluency and naturalness. It serves well for a general audience familiar with AI terminology and podcast context, but could benefit from a final proofread to eliminate minor errors and polish terminology choices for maximum clarity and professionalism."
