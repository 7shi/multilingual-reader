  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation follows a clear narrative structure and explains technical concepts in an accessible way. Sentence construction is generally logical, though a few awkward clauses (e.g., “Lo olvida todo”) and the insertion of meta‑text like “Traducción al español (versión final):” slightly interrupt the flow. Overall, readers can understand the content without major effort.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly for native Spanish speakers, using contemporary vocabulary and correct grammar most of the time. Minor issues include the choice of “afinamiento” instead of the more common “ajuste fino” and occasional comma placement. Nevertheless, the overall tone remains natural and conversational.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto* (ICL), and *anclaje* are accurately rendered and consistently used. The translation retains the original meaning while adapting to Spanish terminology. Only a few terms (e.g., *finetuning* → *afinamiento*) could be slightly more idiomatic, but they are acceptable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally respects the intent and cultural context of the original French text. However, brand names are inconsistently translated: *Tech Destello* appears in the main body, while *Tecno Relámpago* shows up at the end, which may confuse listeners. The rest of the content is well adapted for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original is preserved. The translation does not omit any key ideas and keeps the content concise. The only unnecessary additions are the embedded translation notes (e.g., “Traducción al español (versión final):”), which do not affect comprehension but add redundancy.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the technical explanations and conversational tone of the French source. Minor adjustments—particularly regarding consistent brand naming and smoothing out a few awkward phrases—would elevate the text to flawless standard. The inclusion of meta‑text within the narrative slightly detracts from professional polish but does not hinder understanding. Overall, a solid translation that effectively serves its target audience, with room for small refinements to polish its presentation and maintain consistency throughout the episode script. The overall score reflects an average of 17.4/20, highlighting the translation’s strong grasp of content, terminology, and readability while noting areas for improvement in fluency and contextual adaptation."
