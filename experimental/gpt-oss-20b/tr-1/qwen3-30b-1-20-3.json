  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable for a native audience. Sentences are mostly coherent and logical, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in a straightforward manner. However, some sentences are a bit long and a few minor syntactic choices (e.g., ‘Imaginen que se envía…’) slightly hinder readability. Overall, it remains accessible to the intended listeners.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally fluent but contains several unnatural or awkward phrasings. Examples include 'Imaginen que se envía…' instead of the more idiomatic 'Imagínate que envías…', 'Ella olvida todo' (better: 'el modelo olvida todo'), and occasional mismatched pronouns. Vocabulary choices are appropriate, yet some expressions feel literal and could be smoothed for a native speaker. The overall flow is good but not perfectly natural.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: 'pre-entrenamiento', 'afinamiento', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto', 'anclaje', 'memoria'. The translator keeps the terminology consistent and, where needed, adds explanatory context. The only minor issue is the use of 'afinamiento'—while correct, a more common alternative would be 'ajuste fino' or simply 'ajuste'. Nevertheless, terminology remains clear and consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone of a friendly podcast introduction. Cultural references are minimal, but the Spanish language adaptation uses appropriate greetings (‘Hola y bienvenidos’) and maintains the informal yet explanatory style. Minor improvements could involve more idiomatic expressions, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major elements of the French script are present in the Spanish version: the dialogue structure, key explanations about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning, as well as the discussion on memory functions. No substantive content is omitted, and the translation remains concise while conveying the same level of detail. Therefore, information completeness is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation accurately conveys the technical concepts and overall narrative of the original French podcast script. It is readable and retains all key information, though some sentences could benefit from more natural phrasing. Terminology is well handled and consistent. With a few refinements to idiomatic expressions and pronoun usage, the translation would achieve a higher level of fluency for native Spanish speakers. Overall, a solid translation with room for polish in naturalness and stylistic flow. 85/100 points total (averaged across criteria)."
