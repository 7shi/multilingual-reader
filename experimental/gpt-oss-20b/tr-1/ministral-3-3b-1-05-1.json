  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text mixes the translated dialogue with meta‑comments (e.g., *Justification for translation choices*), explanatory notes, and partially translated fragments. This disrupts the flow, making it hard for a casual listener to follow the conversation. Paragraphs are broken and some sentences are incomplete (e.g., missing verbs or context). Consequently, readability is quite limited.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While many sentences use correct grammar, several expressions feel awkward or literal (e.g., *se olvida de todo* instead of *olvida todo*; *está emergiendo* instead of *está surgiendo*). The dialogue also contains abrupt switches between Spanish and English terms, and some fragments are truncated, causing a stilted reading experience. Overall fluency is mediocre.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally handled correctly—*pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)*, *ventana de contexto*—but there are inconsistencies: *afinado* is used instead of *ajuste fino*, *grounding* remains untranslated, and *anclage* is rendered as *grounding* but not adapted to Spanish. Moreover, some terms are missing or oversimplified. The terminology is functional but not fully consistent.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to keep the informal podcast tone, but the inclusion of footnotes and justifications distracts from the intended conversational style. Cultural nuances are largely preserved, but some French expressions (e.g., *n’est‑ce‑pas?*) are either left untranslated or rendered awkwardly (*¿no es así?*). Overall, the adaptation is adequate but could be smoother.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Significant portions of the original dialogue are omitted or partially repeated; many lines are cut off or replaced by explanatory text. Important details—such as the contrast between ICL and fine‑tuning, the role of memory features—are present but not all are clearly articulated. Redundancy is present in some sections (e.g., repeated explanations of memory). The translation thus fails to convey the full information concisely.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers the core concepts but suffers from a mix of commentary and incomplete sentences, which makes it difficult to read and understand. The technical terminology is largely correct, though inconsistent in some cases. The overall style is uneven, and the text does not fully capture the natural, conversational flow of the original podcast. A cleaner, more faithful, and fully edited version would greatly improve clarity and fluency."
