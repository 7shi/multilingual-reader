  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally easy to read for native speakers. Sentences follow a logical order and the use of conversational language mirrors the original. However, some phrases (e.g., \"El aprendizaje en contexto es del bachotage.\") are slightly awkward, which can momentarily disrupt comprehension. Overall, the dialogue remains clear and comprehensible.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text flows smoothly overall, but there are several grammatical slip‑ups that affect naturalness: \"El IA\" instead of \"La IA\", an odd construction in \"El aprendizaje en contexto es del bachotage.\" The occasional use of parentheses and English abbreviations (ICL) is acceptable in technical contexts but can feel jarring. Despite these minor issues, the majority of sentences read naturally.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most key terms are correctly translated and consistent: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje. The word \"grounding\" is left untranslated in parentheses, which is acceptable for a technical term, though a Spanish equivalent could improve clarity. No major terminology mistakes are present.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original tone to Spanish-speaking audiences, using familiar expressions and maintaining the conversational style. Cultural references are handled appropriately, and the dialogue feels natural in a Spanish context. Minor stylistic choices could be refined, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present, including the distinctions between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning. The explanation about memory and the “Memoria” feature is also included. No critical information is omitted, and the text remains concise while covering all essential concepts.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation successfully conveys the content and intent of the original French script. It is mostly clear and faithful, with only minor issues in fluency and terminology that do not hinder understanding. The overall quality is solid, and the translation would be suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience interested in AI concepts. A small polish would improve its professional polish."
