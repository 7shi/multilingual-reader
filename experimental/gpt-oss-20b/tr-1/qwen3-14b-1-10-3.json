  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable to a native speaker, but several sentences are awkwardly constructed, missing articles, or have gender mismatches (“una conocimiento”). The overall flow is clear, but the cumulative effect of these small errors makes the text feel a bit disjointed. 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many expressions feel unnatural: \"re aprender\" instead of \"reaprender\", “Le aprendizaje en contexto” (incorrect gender and article), and the abrupt, fragmented sentences at the end. These issues hinder smooth reading and give the impression of a literal, word‑by‑word translation. 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are generally correct and consistent. However, a few inconsistencies appear (e.g., the mix of French and Spanish terminology like \"Telle est la réalité du ICL\" remains untranslated). Overall, the terminology is acceptable but not flawless. 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original intent and uses culturally appropriate references, but some contextual nuances are lost or distorted (e.g., the comparison with a consultant is slightly altered, and the explanation of memory mechanisms is incomplete). 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the dialogue at the end are garbled or missing, with incomplete sentences and stray fragments (“Telle est la réalité du ICL”), resulting in omitted explanations and redundancy. This significantly reduces completeness. 9/20.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the core concepts but is marred by multiple grammatical mistakes, awkward phrasing, and missing content. While the general meaning is conveyed, the text would benefit from a thorough copy‑editing and completion of the truncated sections to improve readability, fluency, and completeness for Spanish‑speaking audiences."
