  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but many sentences are fragmented, missing verbs, or left unfinished. The flow of the dialogue is sometimes broken, making it harder for readers to follow the logical progression of the conversation. Nevertheless, the core ideas are conveyed, so the score reflects moderate readability.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several literal borrowings that do not sound natural in Spanish (e.g., “Imaginez que…”, “grounding” left untranslated). Punctuation and sentence structure are inconsistent, and some phrases feel abrupt or awkward. Overall, the text is intelligible but not fluent.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as “pre‑entrenamiento” and “ajuste fino” are correctly rendered, but others (e.g., “grounding”, “memory”) are either untranslated or poorly explained. The consistency is acceptable for most terms, yet a few explanations could be clearer for a non‑expert audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal, conversational tone appropriate for a podcast script. However, some cultural references and idiomatic expressions are not fully adapted (e.g., “¿Verdad?” would be more natural than “N’est‑ce pas?”). The overall intent is preserved but could benefit from tighter localization.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Significant portions of the original dialogue are omitted or truncated. Several lines remain incomplete or are replaced with placeholders, resulting in a loss of detail. While the main storyline is retained, the absence of key sentences reduces completeness.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the gist of the original French script but suffers from noticeable gaps, unfinished sentences, and occasional awkward phrasing. It would benefit from a thorough revision to restore missing content, smooth the flow, and ensure consistent terminology. With these adjustments, the translation could become a coherent, natural, and complete rendition of the source material."
