  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and easy to follow. Sentence structure mirrors the original, and technical concepts are explained in a straightforward way. A small hiccup is the French interjection “D’accord.” which should be “De acuerdo.”, but overall readers can understand the content without confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary. The occasional leftover French phrase and a few slightly awkward phrasings (e.g., “vinculación de respuestas”) do not impede understanding, but they do affect naturalness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as “pre-entrenamiento,” “afinamiento,” “aprendizaje por transferencia,” “ventana de contexto,” and “ICL” are correctly rendered. Terminology is consistent, though “vinculación de respuestas” is a less common choice compared to “anclaje” used earlier. Overall, terminology is handled well.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original tone and conversational style. Cultural adaptation is adequate, but there is an inconsistency: the show name is introduced as “TecnoClaridad” but later referenced as “Tech Éclair.” Also the French “D’accord” remains untranslated. These inconsistencies slightly weaken contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original is present. No substantial content is omitted, and the translation adds no unnecessary detail. The structure and length remain comparable, preserving clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, successfully conveying the original message with clear terminology and a natural flow. Minor issues—such as an untranslated French phrase and a slight inconsistency in the show’s name—do not undermine overall comprehension but slightly affect polish and consistency. With a few small edits, this translation would reach near-perfect quality."
