  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow, but several sentences use literal or awkward phrasing that can momentarily confuse a native reader (e.g., “Lo entendieron todo” and “El aprendizaje en contexto es bacar”). Overall, the message is clear, though a few expressions could be smoothed out for better comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly fluent, but some grammatical slips and unnatural idioms appear: the plural “Lo entendieron todo” should be singular, and “bacar” is not a Spanish verb. Aside from these issues, the flow is smooth and the vocabulary is appropriate for a contemporary audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, etc. The explanation of transfer learning and context memory is preserved. Minor terminology slip with “bacar” is a non‑existent verb, but otherwise the specialist vocabulary is accurate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent of the podcast dialogue is maintained and adapted to Spanish‑speaking culture. However, some expressions could be more idiomatic (e.g., “Lo entendieron todo”). The adaptation is generally effective but leaves room for refinement in cultural nuance.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No substantive content was omitted. All original ideas, examples, and clarifications appear in the translation. The text remains concise and clear, with no unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the original podcast’s content and structure well, with minor grammatical and idiomatic issues that slightly reduce readability and fluency. The technical terminology is largely consistent and clear, and the translation remains faithful to the original meaning. With a few revisions to natural language expressions, the text would read smoothly to a native Spanish audience. Overall, the translation is solid and functional, meriting a strong score overall but highlighting some areas for polishing before final publication or broadcast.  \n\nTotal score: 84/100.  \n\nPlease consider reviewing the awkward phrases and ensuring singular agreement in key sentences to improve clarity and naturalness for the target audience.  \n\n- The word “bacar” should be replaced with a correct verb such as “memorizar” or “repasar”.\n- “Lo entendieron todo” should be “Lo has entendido todo” or “Lo entiendes todo”.\n- Minor punctuation tweaks will enhance overall readability."
