    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable for a native audience. Sentences are short and follow the original structure. However, some phrasing is awkward or slightly confusing, such as \"despearar\" instead of \"desvelar\" and the use of the French phrase \"C'est logique\" left untranslated. These issues slightly reduce the overall clarity.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several unnatural expressions and grammatical errors are present. For example, \"despearar\" is a misspelling, \"C'est logique\" remains in French, and the overall flow feels somewhat stilted in places. While the vocabulary is generally correct, the text could sound more natural with smoother phrasing and consistent language use.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"finetuning\" (as \"afinado\"), \"transfer learning\" and \"In-Context Learning\" are translated appropriately. The terminology is consistent across the piece. Minor issues include the repetition of \"aprendizaje en contexto\" in parentheses, but these do not detract significantly from comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone but sometimes retains French words or phrasing (e.g., \"C'est logique\"). Cultural adaptation is generally good for Spanish-speaking listeners, but the mixture of French phrases could confuse some readers. Adjusting these would improve contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French script are preserved. The narrative flow, explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL, and the memory feature are all present. Minor omissions or errors (like the misspelled verb) do not affect the overall informational content. No substantial information is missing, and the translation is concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core ideas and most of the dialogue accurately. However, it contains several lexical and grammatical errors that impede readability and naturalness. With minor corrections—especially fixing the misspellings, removing leftover French phrases, and smoothing the sentence flow—the Spanish version could reach a high level of quality suitable for a native audience. Currently, it is acceptable but would benefit from proofreading and editing to ensure clarity and fluency across all sections of the podcast script."
