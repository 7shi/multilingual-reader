  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally easy to read and follows a logical order. However, some sentences are overly long and contain slightly awkward phrasing (e.g., \"la IA se recuerda los detalles de mi proyecto\" and \"la IA no ha olvidado en el sentido humano del término; su espacio de trabajo temporal simplemente ha sido vaciado\"). These choices slightly hinder quick comprehension, so a score of 15/20 is appropriate.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most sentences flow well, the use of the formal pronoun \"usted\" in a casual conversational context feels out of place, and a few phrases (e.g., \"la IA no está constantemente afinada\" and \"la IA no ha olvidado en el sentido humano del término\") could be expressed more naturally. Thus the text sounds understandable but not entirely smooth, earning a 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"anclaje\" are correctly rendered. Minor inconsistencies appear (e.g., the plural form \"permanente\" vs. \"permanentes\"), but overall terminology is accurate and consistently used. Score: 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the overall intent and conversational tone, but the switch to a formal register (\"usted\") and some literal translations reduce cultural resonance with a Spanish-speaking audience who would expect a more relaxed style. Additionally, a few idiomatic expressions could be adapted better. Consequently, the adaptation is acceptable but not optimal – 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the original French transcript are present, and no essential content was omitted. Some sentences are longer or slightly rephrased, but the core meaning remains intact. No unnecessary repetitions were introduced. Therefore, the translation is complete – 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and mostly faithful to the original, with clear structure and accurate technical terminology. Some stylistic choices, especially the formal pronoun usage and a few awkward phrasings, detract from naturalness and readability. A more relaxed register and smoother sentence constructions would elevate the overall quality. Still, the translation conveys the intended meaning effectively and would be understandable to a Spanish-speaking audience with moderate linguistic adjustments needed for a polished finish."
