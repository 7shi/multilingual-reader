    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version keeps the dialogue structure and the logical flow of the original. Most sentences are clear and the explanation of concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning is understandable. However, a few sentences feel slightly awkward or overly literal, which may momentarily distract readers. Overall, the text is readable for a Spanish‑speaking audience at an intermediate level.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation uses natural Spanish in many places, but there are several phrases that are either too literal or slightly unnatural. Examples include \"la IA no está constantemente afinando con sus conversaciones\" (the verb choice and preposition are awkward) and \"se le proporcionó una ayuda justo antes de que comenzara a hablar\" (the term \"ayuda\" is vague). Some technical terms are left in English (e.g., \"fine‑tuning\") and the use of the phrase \"una gran cantidad de datos en Internet\" feels repetitive. The overall flow is acceptable but could be smoothed for native fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly – \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"grounding\" are appropriate. However, the term \"fine‑tuning\" is left untranslated, which is inconsistent. The translation also misses opportunities to explain or paraphrase terms when necessary (e.g., explaining what \"in‑context learning\" entails). Consistency and clarity could be improved by using Spanish equivalents such as \"ajuste fino\" and adding brief clarifications where needed.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone, and it does not introduce culturally inappropriate references. The adaptation is generally effective, though some phrasing could be more idiomatic to Spanish‑speaking audiences, especially when referring to the memory feature (“la IA no está constantemente afinando con sus conversaciones” sounds slightly odd). Overall, the context is maintained, but slight adjustments would enhance cultural resonance.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. No major omissions are noted, and the content remains concise. Minor redundancies are avoided, and the overall narrative flow is preserved. Thus, the translation is complete in terms of information transfer.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is generally competent, capturing the main ideas and conversational style of the original French script. It excels in maintaining readability and information completeness, but could benefit from improved fluency and terminology consistency. The translation would feel more natural and professional if technical terms were fully localized and some awkward phrasings were smoothed out. With minor refinements, it would meet a high standard for a native Spanish‑speaking audience. The overall score reflects these strengths and areas for improvement: a solid 16/20 average across criteria, translating to an overall quality rating of 16 out of 20. This reflects a translation that is good but not yet perfect in fluency and technical precision. The reviewer recommends reviewing and adjusting key terms and smoothing certain phrases for a more polished final product. This should raise the overall quality to 18/20 or higher after revision."
