    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, but several typographical errors (missing accents, misspellings such as *conocencias* for *conocimientos*) and awkward phrasing (*Hola y bienvenido en*, *Se tiene la impresión…*) interrupt the flow. Nonetheless, the main ideas are clear enough for a native reader to follow the dialogue and grasp the concepts presented.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the translation captures the overall meaning, it contains several unnatural expressions and grammatical slips that make the prose feel slightly stilted. Examples include *Hola y bienvenido en* (should be *Bienvenidos a*), *Se tiene la impresión…* (better phrased as *Parece que*), and *Gracias por haber escuchado a nosotros* (should be *Gracias por escuchar el programa*). These affect the naturalness for a native audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *afinado* (fine‑tuning), *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *anclaje*, *memoria*. The terminology is consistent throughout, and no essential technical concept is lost. A minor inconsistency is the occasional shift between *afinado* and *afinamiento*, but this does not impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original intent and humor, but a few cultural adaptations are missing or incorrect. The greeting should be *Bienvenidos a* instead of *bienvenido en*. The closing line (*Gracias por haber escuchado a nosotros*) feels awkward in Spanish. Otherwise, the dialogue reflects the casual, explanatory tone of the French original. Overall, the contextual adaptation is acceptable but could be refined.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All significant points from the original French are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, anchoring, memory features, and the concluding question. No key details are omitted, and the translation adds no extraneous content. The only slight redundancy comes from repeated explanations of ICL, which mirrors the original structure.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely faithful and captures the main ideas, but it is marred by several grammatical errors, missing accents, and a few unnatural phrasings that reduce readability and fluency. Terminology and completeness are strong, while contextual adaptation could benefit from minor adjustments to better fit Spanish idiomatic usage. With a few edits to punctuation, spelling, and phrasing, the translation would reach a professional standard suitable for a native Spanish audience. The overall quality is good but not perfect, warranting a moderate score across the criteria with the most improvement needed in fluency and contextual adaptation. Good job, but a quick polish would bring it to the next level."
