  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow for native speakers, but the frequent misspellings, missing accents, and abrupt language switches (from Spanish to French) create occasional confusion. The sentence structure is mostly logical, yet some paragraphs are broken by untranslated fragments. Overall readability is acceptable but not perfect.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural expressions and grammatical errors: missing accents (e.g., \"¿Porque\" instead of \"¿Por qué?\"), wrong verb forms (\"Ha entendido\" instead of \"Has entendido\"), and literal, stilted phrasing (e.g., \"La IA no se ajusta constantemente por tus conversaciones\"). Moreover, the interjection of French fragments makes the text feel disjointed. These issues reduce the natural flow significantly.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly rendered, and the chosen vocabulary is contemporary. However, the inconsistency caused by the French remnants (e.g., \"apprentissage en contexte\", \"C'est\") introduces ambiguity. Overall, terminology is adequately handled but not consistently so.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation captures the informal podcast style and retains the conversational tone. Cultural references are generally appropriate. Nevertheless, the inadvertent insertion of French sentences and occasional literal translations (e.g., \"aprender en contexto es como hacer trampa\") dilute the contextual adaptation, leading to a mix of registers that could confuse the audience.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is preserved, including key concepts and examples. However, the presence of French fragments and some missing or altered phrases (e.g., the wrong use of \"Ha entendido todo\") indicates that certain details are either omitted or incorrectly conveyed. The overall amount of information is sufficient but not perfect.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material’s meaning but suffers from significant issues: repeated French fragments, missing accents, grammatical errors, and unnatural phrasing. These problems detract from readability, fluency, and consistency. A thorough revision is necessary to produce a polished, fully Spanish version that maintains the intended tone and clarity of the original text. The translation would benefit from a careful proofreading and a consistency check across terminology and style choices. Overall, the current version is acceptable as a draft but not ready for publication in a professional podcast script without further editing and correction of the mixed-language artefacts and grammatical inaccuracies. The translation quality is moderate, and the scores reflect the need for substantial improvement to meet professional standards in both linguistic accuracy and cultural adaptation. The overall score is 61 out of 100, reflecting the presence of many issues that should be addressed to elevate the translation to a high-quality standard."
