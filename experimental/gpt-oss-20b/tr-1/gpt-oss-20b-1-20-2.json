  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally easy to follow and the sentence structure is logical. However, some phrases feel slightly literal or lack the natural flow expected in conversational Spanish, such as \"Cuando abre una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío\" (should be \"parte de un contexto vacío\"). Overall, the content remains comprehensible for native readers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly in most places, but a few expressions are somewhat awkward or too literal, e.g., \"Lo has entendido todo\" and \"Se puede decir eso\". Minor grammatical quirks and the occasional missing accent marks slightly reduce the naturalness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"anclaje\". The translation uses the accepted Spanish terminology for AI concepts and provides clear explanations when necessary.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and tone, adapting idiomatic expressions where possible. Some expressions could be further localized to sound more native (e.g., replacing literal phrasings with Spanish idioms), but the overall cultural adaptation is adequate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French text is present. There are no omissions, and the translation keeps the content concise while maintaining the explanatory structure. The narrative flow is preserved throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the original message clearly and uses appropriate technical terminology. While it could benefit from minor stylistic refinements to improve naturalness, the translation is generally accurate, readable, and faithful to the source material. It would be suitable for Spanish-speaking audiences familiar with AI concepts, with only small adjustments needed for optimal fluency and cultural nuance."
