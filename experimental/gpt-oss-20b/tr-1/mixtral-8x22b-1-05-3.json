  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue is mostly easy to follow and the ideas are presented in a logical sequence. Minor typos (e.g. missing accent on *preentrenamiento*, *afino* instead of *ajuste fino*) slightly hinder readability, but overall the text is comprehensible for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally, yet several awkward expressions and grammatical mistakes appear: *AIC* for ICL, *recuerdo* instead of *memoria*, “afino” for fine‑tuning, and some redundant phrasing. These reduce the smoothness of the text.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered (*preentrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto*). However, the abbreviation *AIC* is incorrect and *afino* is not the standard translation for fine‑tuning. Consistency overall is acceptable but with minor lapses.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The cultural adaptation is adequate; the use of everyday analogies (consultor, bicicleta) works well. There are no major issues with cultural references, though a few terms could have been localized better (e.g., “consultor temporal” might sound more natural as “consultor temporal o experto permanente”).",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the essential content of the original French script. A few small details are slightly misrepresented (e.g., *AIC* for ICL, “recuerdo” vs. “memoria”), but no major ideas are omitted and no unnecessary information is added.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material and delivers a largely faithful rendition. While readability and contextual adaptation are strong, fluency and terminology suffer from a handful of inaccuracies that could confuse a native speaker or a technical reader. Addressing the highlighted issues would bring the work closer to a professional‑grade translation."
