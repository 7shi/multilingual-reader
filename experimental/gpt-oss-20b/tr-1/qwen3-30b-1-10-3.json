  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow and preserves the conversational flow of the original French dialogue.  Simple sentence structures and clear explanations of technical concepts make it accessible to a general audience.  Minor issues arise with a few awkward phrasing choices (“Imaginen que enviamos una IA totalmente nueva a la escuela” sounds slightly clunky) and occasional missing articles, but these do not impede understanding.  Overall, readability is good.  Score: 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation reads smoothly and uses contemporary Spanish vocabulary.  However, some expressions feel slightly literal or unnatural—for instance, “reentrenar la IA” instead of the more common “ajustar finamente la IA” or “entrenar de nuevo”.  The use of “Ustedes han comprendido todo” is a bit formal for a podcast script.  Punctuation and article usage are correct most of the time, but the overall flow remains natural.  Score: 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved and correctly translated: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto” (ICL) and “anclaje” (grounding).  The term “ICL” is repeated with a Spanish translation in parentheses, which keeps the terminology consistent.  There are a few places where the translation could be tighter (“reentrenar” vs “ajustar finamente”), but overall terminology is appropriate and consistent.  Score: 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator keeps the informal, conversational tone suitable for a podcast.  Cultural references are minimal, but the Spanish version uses idiomatic expressions (e.g., “se siente como contratar a un consultor brillante”) that fit a Spanish-speaking audience.  Minor cultural nuances could be enhanced (e.g., using “ventana de contexto” instead of “contextual window”), yet the intent and purpose of the original are conveyed effectively.  Score: 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All sections of the original French script are present in the Spanish translation, with no omissions of key details.  Explanations for technical concepts are preserved, and the narrative flow remains intact.  Redundancy is minimal and the content stays concise.  Minor translation nuances (e.g., “el prompt” kept in English) do not affect comprehension.  Score: 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, successfully conveying the original French dialogue in a natural, conversational Spanish suitable for a podcast audience.  While there are a few literal phrasing choices and minor fluency tweaks that could improve the text, the overall readability, terminology, and informational content are strong.  The script remains engaging and faithful to the source material, making it an effective Spanish version of the podcast episode.  Overall, the translation demonstrates a solid grasp of both linguistic nuance and technical accuracy.  Score: 17/20."
