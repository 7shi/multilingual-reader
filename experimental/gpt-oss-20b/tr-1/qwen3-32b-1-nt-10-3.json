    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and follows a clear conversational flow. However, a few lines are broken (e.g., “Camille: we”), and some sentence structures feel clunky, which slightly hampers readability.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several awkward or incorrect phrases appear (e.g., “Usted lo ha entendido todo” instead of a more natural “Lo has entendido todo”), duplicated words, and a few grammatical mistakes. The overall voice is not fully natural for a native speaker.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", and \"anclaje\" are generally correct. Inconsistencies arise with \"ajuste fino\" vs. \"afinamiento\" and the omission of \"fine‑tuning\" in the first part, but most terminology is appropriately handled.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the general intent and tone of the original dialogue, but some cultural or idiomatic nuances are not fully polished. Certain phrases feel slightly literal and could be smoother, yet the main message is preserved.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is present, though a line is clearly missing or corrupted (“Camille: we”) and a few explanations (e.g., the nuance of the Memory feature) are not fully expanded. Redundancies are largely avoided, but a few omissions slightly reduce completeness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation delivers the core ideas of the original French script and employs appropriate technical terminology. However, it suffers from several awkward phrasings, duplication errors, and a few missing lines that affect readability and fluency. With some refinement and careful proofreading, the text could reach a higher level of naturalness and precision suitable for a native audience. The current quality is acceptable for an informal broadcast but would need polishing for professional or formal use. Overall, the translation is solid but leaves room for improvement in fluency, consistency, and completeness."
