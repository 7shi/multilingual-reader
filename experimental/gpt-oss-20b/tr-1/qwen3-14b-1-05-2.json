  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated script is largely understandable and the sentence structure follows typical Spanish syntax. However, some phrases are slightly awkward (e.g., \"Lo han entendido todo\" instead of \"Lo has entendido todo\") and a few idioms are less natural for native speakers, which can mildly hinder the flow for a quick read.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the text reads smoothly and uses appropriate contemporary vocabulary. Minor grammatical slips (subject–verb agreement errors, unnatural word order) and occasional literal translations of idiomatic expressions reduce overall naturalness. Overall, the fluency is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine-tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"in‑context learning (ICL)\" are correctly rendered and consistent throughout. Explanations are provided where needed, so the terminology is accurate and accessible for the intended audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation preserves the original intent and tone of a podcast introduction and dialogue. Cultural references are appropriately translated (e.g., \"consultor brillante\" instead of a literal rendering). The Spanish version still feels somewhat formal and could be slightly more relaxed to match a spoken podcast style, but the overall contextual adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the consultant vs. permanent expert analogy. Minor details are missing or slightly altered (e.g., a missing accent or a word misplacement), but no substantial information is omitted, and the text stays concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers a clear, mostly fluent Spanish script that retains the original content and technical nuance. Some minor grammatical and stylistic issues slightly reduce readability and naturalness, but overall the translation is competent and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. With a few edits to smooth out awkward phrasing and correct minor errors, it would achieve an excellent score across all criteria. Overall: 85 / 100 points. 8.5/10.0 (rounded to two decimal places)."
