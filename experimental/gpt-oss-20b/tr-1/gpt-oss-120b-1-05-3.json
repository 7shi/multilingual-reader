  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and logically structured. Sentences are easy to follow, and the explanation of complex concepts (e.g., pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL) is straightforward. Minor issues such as an extra article in \"la IA le comprend déjà\" and the repetition of \"de\" in the phrase about grammar, syntax, and sentence structure slightly affect flow, but overall comprehension is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary. The occasional mis‑use of pronouns (e.g., \"la IA le comprend déjà\") and the slightly informal use of \"entre bastidores\" do not majorly disrupt fluency. These issues keep the score a touch below perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", and \"anclaje\" are correctly rendered and consistently used. The translation includes brief explanations where needed, ensuring that a reader unfamiliar with the terms can understand them. No major terminology errors were found.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the original intent and conversational tone of the podcast. Cultural adaptation is adequate: idiomatic expressions are minimal, and the script remains approachable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., keeping the English word \"prompt\") could be further localized, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present in the Spanish version. No significant omissions or unwarranted additions appear. The structure mirrors the original dialogue, maintaining clarity and brevity. The only minor redundancy is the repeated use of \"la IA\" in a few sentences, but it does not detract from the overall completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation achieves a high level of quality, maintaining clarity, naturalness, and technical accuracy. Minor grammatical quirks and some stylistic choices leave room for polish, but these do not significantly impair understanding. Overall, the Spanish version faithfully conveys the content and tone of the original French text, making it suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Overall score: 17/20."
