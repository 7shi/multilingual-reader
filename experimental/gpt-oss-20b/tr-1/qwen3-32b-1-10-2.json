  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely understandable to Spanish‑speaking readers. The dialogue structure is preserved, and the speaker turns are clear. Some longer sentences, however, contain minor syntactic awkwardness (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto es un bachotaje.”) that slightly hampers smooth reading. Nevertheless, the overall comprehensibility remains high, earning 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most expressions sound natural, a few choices feel literal or awkward: “bachotaje” (instead of a more idiomatic “memorizar” or “repaso”) and some duplicated phrases (“El aprendizaje en contexto es …”). The overall flow is acceptable but not fully idiomatic, so 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, memoria, ICL. Translations are accurate for a general audience, with no major misinterpretations, justifying 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the conversational tone and adapts most cultural references suitably. Minor adjustments could improve naturalness (e.g., phrasing “se envía una IA a la escuela” could be more fluid). Overall, it conveys the original intent, earning 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the original is present; no omissions. Some phrases are slightly simplified but still preserve meaning. No unnecessary redundancy was added. Thus 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation effectively conveys the meaning of the original French dialogue and preserves its informal, conversational style. The text is understandable and largely accurate in terminology, but it suffers from a few unnatural word choices and slightly awkward phrasing that could be polished for a more native feel. With minor refinements—particularly replacing “bachotaje” with a more idiomatic expression and smoothing some duplicated structures—the translation would reach near‑perfect fluency and readability."
