  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is understandable, but several sentences are slightly clunky or worded in a way that feels less natural to a native listener. Overall, the story and concepts are clear, though some parts require the reader to re‑read for full comprehension. 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains occasional awkward phrasing (“la IA no « olvidó » en el sentido humano”, “se abre una nueva ventana”) and inconsistent use of quotation marks. The dialogue remains conversational but would flow better with smoother verb forms and more idiomatic expressions. 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are accurately rendered (“entrenamiento previo”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”). Minor improvements could be made (“ajuste fino” instead of “afinado” for fine‑tuning). Terminology is consistent throughout and suitable for the target audience. 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The tone of a podcast is preserved and the Spanish cultural context is respected. Minor wording choices (“Hola y bienvenido en” vs. “Hola y bienvenidos a”) slightly reduce localization quality. Overall adaptation is effective. 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present; no major omissions or additions. The dialogue stays faithful, and the translation does not introduce redundant content. 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation largely captures the meaning and conversational style of the original French text. Technical concepts are accurately rendered, and the dialogue remains engaging for a native audience. Minor issues with natural phrasing, verb choice, and punctuation slightly detract from readability and fluency. With a small polish to refine idiomatic expressions and consistency, the translation would reach a higher level of professionalism. Overall, it is a solid translation that effectively communicates the intended message to Spanish‑speaking listeners. 17/20.0 (average of the five criteria)."
