  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to read and follows the logical flow of the original dialogue. Sentences are short and the narrative stays consistent. Minor phrasing issues (e.g., “el aprendizaje en contexto, es cramar”) do not impede understanding, but they slightly reduce readability.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly natural for a Spanish speaker. Some awkward or non‑idiomatic expressions appear, such as “tiene la impresión de que ellas realmente empiezan a recordar” and “el aprendizaje en contexto, es cramar.” Additionally, a couple of grammatical slips (“la IA no se afinada”) and redundancies (“Aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en contexto)”) reduce the smoothness. Overall, fluency is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled mostly correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\". The choice of \"anclaje\" is acceptable, though \"fundamento\" appears inconsistently. Terminology is consistent and appropriate for a general audience, with no major mistranslations.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original conversational tone and intent. Cultural adaptations are adequate: analogies like \"contratar un consultor brillante\" fit Spanish usage. Minor improvements could be made (e.g., using “consultor” instead of “consultante”) but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present. The translation does not omit any substantive content, and the explanations of concepts remain clear. There are a few duplicated phrases (e.g., the repeated ICL mention) and a slight grammatical typo, but these do not affect completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and conveys the original content with good fidelity. It is readable and largely fluent, with minor grammatical and stylistic slip‑ups that do not compromise comprehension. Technical terminology is handled appropriately, and contextual adaptation is satisfactory. With a few refinements to flow and small corrections, the translation could reach a near‑perfect level."
