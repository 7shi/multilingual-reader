  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally clear and easy to follow, with simple sentence structures that mirror the conversational tone of the original. Some long sentences could be split for better flow, but overall readers can understand the technical concepts without confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish is mostly natural, but a few phrasing choices feel slightly awkward for native speakers. Examples include \"reentrenar\" (more commonly \"afinar\"), the use of quotation marks around English terms like \"prompt\", and the repetition of \"la IA\" in a way that can sound stilted. These minor issues reduce fluency slightly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly translated and consistently used: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"anclaje\". However, the term \"prompt\" is left in English; while common in AI discourse, a fully localized version could improve clarity. Overall terminology handling is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references well: greeting changes from \"Bonjour\" to \"Hola\", the informal style is preserved, and explanations are tailored to Spanish-speaking audiences. Minor cultural mismatches (e.g., some English loan‑words) are negligible.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are retained: pretraining, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, memory mechanisms, and the consultant vs. permanent expert analogy. No critical content is omitted, and the narrative flow remains intact. Some redundant phrasing is present but does not obscure meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation faithfully reproduces the original French podcast script, preserving its conversational tone, technical depth, and cultural nuance. While a few natural‑language quirks and minor terminology choices could be polished, the translation is clear, accurate, and ready for a native Spanish‑speaking audience. It strikes a good balance between fidelity to the source and readability in the target language, making it a solidly high‑quality rendering of the original content. The overall quality scores well, reflecting both its strengths and minor areas for refinement. Overall score: 17/20."
