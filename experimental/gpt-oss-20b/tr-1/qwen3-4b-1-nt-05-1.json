  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable for native readers. The sentence structure follows the original fairly closely, and complex ideas such as pre‑training and fine‑tuning are explained in clear, simple language. However, some sentences contain small syntactic slips (e.g., “la IA no se afinan” instead of “no se afinan”) that slightly hinder the flow. Overall, the passage is readable with minor interruptions.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation displays a good overall naturalness, but a number of awkward constructions and grammatical errors stand out: \"la IA no se afinan\", \"se tiene la impresión\", \"en las sombras\". These reduce the smoothness and make certain parts feel stilted. A more careful editing would improve the naturalness, but the text remains comprehensible for native Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly translated and consistently used throughout the text: \"pre‑entrenamiento\" → \"entrenamiento previo\", \"fine‑tuning\" → \"afinado\", \"transfer learning\" → \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"in‑context learning\" → \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\", \"memory\" → \"memoria\". The terminology matches the level expected of a general‑audience audience. Minor issues arise with the verb agreement in the phrase \"la IA no se afinan\", but terminology itself is sound.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the conversational tone of a podcast and respects cultural expectations (e.g., using \"Hola\" and a friendly sign‑off). Some idiomatic choices could be more idiomatic (e.g., \"se tiene la impresión\" instead of \"se da la impresión\"). Nonetheless, the intended message is effectively conveyed, and there is no mis‑interpretation of the original content.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the main points from the original French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, temporary versus permanent knowledge, and the discussion of memory features. No significant information is omitted. The only minor omission is a slight variation in phrasing that does not alter the meaning. Overall, the translation preserves the full information set.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and largely faithful to the original French text. It accurately conveys the technical concepts and preserves the conversational, podcast style. However, a few grammatical errors and somewhat unnatural phrasing detract from its fluency and readability. With a quick proofreading and smoothing of the more awkward segments, the translation would reach an excellent level of quality. Current overall score: 82/100 (average 16.4/20)."
