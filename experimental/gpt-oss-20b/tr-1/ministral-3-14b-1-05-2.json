    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable for a native speaker. The dialogues flow logically and the key ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory) are expressed clearly. Some sentence fragments and abrupt punctuation (e.g., “Lo olvida todo.”) slightly interrupt the flow, but overall the reader can follow the conversation without confusion.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text feels mostly natural, but several awkward or literal constructions detract from smoothness. Examples include “Lo olvida todo.” (better: “Lo olvida.” or “Lo olvidó.”), “una chuleta” (colloquial but could be “una pista” in a more formal context), and the inconsistent use of “afinage” (French word) in the Spanish version. Moreover, some translation choices (“Tech Relámpago” vs “Tech Éclair”) feel forced rather than idiomatic. These issues lower overall fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly translated: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", \"memoria\". The inclusion of the English abbreviation ICL is appropriate for a technical audience. The brief note explaining “afinage” is unnecessary and breaks consistency. Overall, terminology is clear, consistent, and suitable for the target readership.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and tone, keeping the informal, conversational style of a podcast. Cultural adaptation is minimal; the title change to “Tech Relámpago” is a localized attempt, though it may not resonate as strongly with Spanish speakers as “Tech Destello” or “Tech Rayo” could. Minor phrasing adjustments (e.g., “una pista” instead of “una chuleta”) would improve cultural fit. Overall, context is well conveyed.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present: explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, anchoring, memory features, and the consultant vs expert analogy. No substantive content is omitted. The translation adds explanatory parentheses for clarity, which help but are not essential. Redundancy is minimal, and the overall message remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and largely faithful to the source text, effectively conveying technical concepts in a conversational Spanish suitable for a podcast audience. However, it suffers from some grammatical and stylistic quirks, occasional literal translations, and inconsistent terminology (e.g., the stray French word \"afinage\"). Refining these areas would raise fluency and naturalness, making the text feel more polished for native readers. Overall, the translation is solid but could benefit from a final review to smooth out minor errors and improve consistency across the entire script."
