  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly intelligible, but several sentences are fragmented or lack necessary punctuation (e.g., \"Luc: - de l'ICL\" or the stray \"we\"). Word order is sometimes awkward, and a few phrases are missing or incomplete. Overall, the content is understandable but not polished for a fluent reader.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The prose contains a number of unnatural expressions, missing accents, and some literal translations that sound stilted (e.g., \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\" instead of a more natural \"Lo has comprendido todo\"), which reduces overall smoothness. However, it is largely grammatically correct and understandable.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", \"memoria\". There is consistency and the terms are appropriate for a general audience. Minor issues: occasional mistranslations like \"we\" and an incomplete phrase \"- de l'ICL\". Overall, terminology usage is solid.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the intent and tone of the original French podcast. Cultural references are retained and the dialogue style is maintained. However, a few phrases feel too literal or lose the conversational nuance (e.g., \"Luc: Cuando abren una nueva ventana, parten de un contexto vacío.\"). Overall, the adaptation is acceptable but could be smoother.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all content from the source is present. There are no major omissions, but a few lines are garbled or missing context (e.g., the stray \"we\" and the incomplete line \"Luc: - de l'ICL\"). These issues slightly detract from completeness, yet the core information remains intact.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely faithful and understandable, but it suffers from several copy‑editing problems: fragmented sentences, occasional literal wording, and a few missing or garbled lines. The technical terminology is handled well, and the overall intent is preserved, but the text would benefit from a thorough proofreading to improve readability and naturalness for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The final quality would be adequate for a first draft but needs polishing before publication or broadcast usage."
