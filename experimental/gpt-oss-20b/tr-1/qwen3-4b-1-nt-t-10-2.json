  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely comprehensible, with straightforward sentence construction and clear explanations of complex concepts. However, some sentences are slightly awkward or incomplete (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto, es aprovechamiento.”). The overall flow is logical but a few phrases could be simplified for better clarity.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly smoothly, but there are several unnatural expressions and grammatical slips such as “Usted ha entendido todo.” instead of a more natural “Has entendido todo.” and the misplaced comma in “El aprendizaje en contexto, es aprovechamiento.”. Vocabulary is generally appropriate, but these small issues hinder full fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms like *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, and *ventana de contexto* are correctly rendered and consistently used. The acronym ICL is retained without explanation, which could confuse some readers. The use of the English word *prompt* in the Spanish context is acceptable in tech‑heavy dialogue, but a Spanish equivalent could improve consistency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts most idioms and cultural references appropriately, preserving the conversational tone. However, the phrase “El aprendizaje en contexto, es aprovechamiento.” misrepresents the original nuance slightly. The adaptation generally respects the target audience’s cultural background, but some wording could be refined for greater naturalness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present in the Spanish version, with no major omissions. The content remains concise and clear, though a few explanatory phrases are slightly altered (e.g., “aprovechamiento” instead of “aplicación” or “contexto” is sometimes left untranslated). Overall, the information is complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and largely faithful to the original content, capturing the main ideas and dialogue structure. Minor linguistic slips and some awkward phrasing reduce the overall polish, but the text remains readable and technically accurate. With a few adjustments to natural phrasing and consistent terminology, it could achieve near‑perfect quality. The overall score reflects these strengths and small shortcomings: 16/20.  Overall, the translation is competent and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience, albeit with room for refinement in fluency and contextual nuance."
