    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely intelligible for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Sentence structure largely follows the original, and complex ideas are broken down in a way that keeps the narrative flow. Some minor issues—such as the use of “Han entendido todo” instead of “Lo has entendido todo”—may momentarily confuse readers, but overall comprehension is preserved. Score: 16/20",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation often feels stilted or literal, especially with phrases like “Se hace posible por la expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo” or “Han entendido todo.” These constructions sound unnatural to native Spanish speakers. Word choice is mostly fine, but a few instances of awkward grammar reduce the smoothness of the dialogue. Score: 15/20",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are translated accurately: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, anchoring (“anclaje”). Consistency is maintained throughout the episode. The use of “memoria” for the new feature is appropriate, though a brief explanatory note could have helped non‑technical listeners. Overall, terminology handling is solid. Score: 18/20",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation to Spanish culture is generally effective; idiomatic expressions and the casual tone fit a podcast format. Some cultural nuances—such as the phrase “Le enviamos una nueva IA a la escuela”—are slightly awkward but still understandable. Minor improvements (e.g., using “corto plazo” consistently) would elevate the adaptation. Score: 17/20",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French transcript are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory feature. No substantive content is omitted, and the translation keeps the same level of detail. The dialogue is concise and free of unnecessary repetition. Score: 18/20",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the core message and structure of the French source. While it is largely understandable and uses correct terminology, several linguistic choices hinder naturalness. Minor grammatical refinements and smoother phrasing would raise the quality to a professional level. The translation is serviceable for an audience familiar with the topic, but could benefit from a second polish to improve flow and readability for general listeners. Overall, a competent but slightly rough job. 16/20 points.  (Score reflects the average of individual criteria.)"
