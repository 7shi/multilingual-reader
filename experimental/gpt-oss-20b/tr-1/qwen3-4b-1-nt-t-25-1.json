  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation retains the overall storyline and most of the conversational flow. However, several sentences contain awkward word choices, incorrect articles, missing accents, and slightly confusing phrasing (e.g., “se envía una IA completamente nueva a la escuela”, “le afinado”, “¿Ya he oído este término?”). These issues can make it difficult for native readers to follow the dialogue smoothly, especially for less fluent speakers. The content is still comprehensible, but the readability is noticeably hampered by these grammatical quirks.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the vocabulary is largely appropriate, the translation lacks natural flow. Several sentences feel literal or stilted (e.g., “Es el aprendizaje en contexto, es del ‘bachotage’.”, “Una memoria de uso único.”). Pronoun agreement errors (“¿Ya he oído?” instead of “¿Ya has oído?”) and incorrect punctuation further disrupt the rhythm. Native speakers would find these parts awkward and may need to re‑phrase them to sound smooth.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly translated correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\" (though “el afinado” was used), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"ventana de contexto\". There is consistency throughout, and the level of explanation matches the intended audience. Minor slips (e.g., “promp” instead of “prompt”) do not significantly detract from understanding.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator keeps the original intent and conversational tone, but some idiomatic expressions were not fully adapted to Spanish culture (e.g., using “diplomado” instead of a more neutral “graduado” or “titulados”). The overall message is conveyed, but a few cultural nuances (such as the casual phrasing of “El afinado… es allí donde interviene…”) feel slightly out of place for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Improvements could be made to make the dialogue feel more native.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French text is present. No major content was omitted, and the translation follows the same sequence of explanations. The script covers pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the consultant analogy. The only small addition is a mis‑phrased “promp” instead of “prompt,” which does not alter the content. Redundancy is minimal, and the text stays concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation accurately captures the gist of the original dialogue and maintains the structure and technical concepts. However, grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and some mis‑applied pronouns reduce its readability and naturalness. With a thorough copy‑editing pass focusing on article usage, verb agreement, accent marks, and more idiomatic Spanish expressions, the translation would achieve a higher level of fluency while preserving its technical accuracy and contextual intent. Overall, it is a solid first draft that requires polishing before publication to native audiences."
