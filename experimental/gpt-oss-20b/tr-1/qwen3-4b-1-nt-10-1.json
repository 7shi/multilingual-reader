    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows a logical sentence order. However, there are noticeable gaps and a few confusing insertions—most notably the fragment “Camille: , que algunas IA comienzan a integrar?”—which disrupt the flow. Additionally, some verb conjugations (“cuando usted afinan”) are incorrect, making certain passages harder to parse. Overall, readers can follow the gist but encounter friction in parts.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural expressions and grammatical errors: “cuando usted afinan”, “se tiene la impresión” (should be “se da la impresión”), “una forma astuciosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado” sounds clunky. While the vocabulary is mostly correct, these mistakes break the natural rhythm expected of native Spanish speakers, reducing overall fluency.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto* are correctly rendered. The abbreviation *ICL* is preserved and explained, and *grounding* is translated as *anclaje*, which is acceptable. Minor inconsistencies (e.g., keeping *In-Context Learning* as an English phrase) are present, but overall terminology is largely appropriate.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the core intent and conversational tone, using analogies that are culturally familiar (“consultor brillante”, “montar en bicicleta”). However, the garbled sentence about memory features and the absence of a clear explanation of the new *Mémoire* function dilute the contextual fidelity. The adaptation is decent but marred by these omissions.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several segments from the original are missing or corrupted: the discussion of the new memory feature is truncated, and the flow between Luc’s and Camille’s lines is interrupted. These gaps mean that critical explanatory content is not fully conveyed, lowering completeness. Minor redundancy is present, but the key issue is missing information.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures much of the original meaning and technical content, but it suffers from noticeable errors, missing passages, and awkward phrasing. While the terminology is mostly accurate, the readability and fluency are hindered by grammatical mistakes and gaps, resulting in a translation that is usable for a general audience but not polished enough for publication or professional use. Significant revisions would be required to meet high-quality standards, particularly in correcting verb conjugations, restoring omitted sections, and smoothing the overall flow. The translation is a solid first draft that needs refinement to fully serve its intended audience and purpose. The overall quality is moderate, but with substantial room for improvement in coherence and completeness. The translation's average score across criteria is 12/20, indicating a fair but not excellent performance. This score reflects the need for careful editing and completion of omitted content to achieve a reliable, natural, and technically accurate final product. The translation is functional but not yet optimal for a professional Spanish-speaking audience. Overall, it demonstrates competence but falls short of high‑quality standards. The translation should be revised to correct errors, restore missing sections, and ensure linguistic naturalness before it can be considered finished."
