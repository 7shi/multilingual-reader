    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally comprehensible, but several sentences are awkwardly constructed, contain misspellings (e.g., \"conocencias\"), and in some places the meaning is unclear or partially omitted. The duplication of a paragraph and the mix of French/English fragments hinder smooth reading. Overall, the flow is acceptable but noticeably fragmented.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While many expressions sound natural, the translation includes noticeable non‑native constructions such as \"es el aprendizaje en contexto en acción\" and literal repetitions. The presence of English fragments (e.g., \"Precisely.\") and the inconsistent use of gender/number in words like \"informaciones\" detract from fluency. The overall tone feels conversational but uneven.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\" (as \"afinamiento\"), \"transfer learning\" (\"aprendizaje por transferencia\"), \"ICL\", \"grounding\" (\"enracinamiento\"). However, some translations are suboptimal: \"enracinamiento\" is uncommon, \"ancrage\" would be better rendered as \"anclaje\"; \"informaciones\" should be singular. Inconsistencies appear in the use of \"ICL\" and the English word \"prompt\" is left untranslated in several places.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The cultural adaptation is modest. The Spanish version retains the podcast’s informal tone but occasionally uses literal phrasing that may feel awkward to native listeners. Cultural references are minimal, so there is little risk of misinterpretation, yet the translation could better reflect Spanish idiomatic usage (e.g., replace \"Lo que usted proporciona\" with \"Lo que das\" in a conversational context).",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Key ideas from the original are mostly present, but some details are missing or duplicated, especially toward the end where a paragraph is repeated verbatim. English fragments interrupt the flow and obscure the intended meaning. Overall, some content is omitted or garbled, reducing completeness.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main concepts but suffers from readability, fluency, and completeness issues. Redundant or duplicated sections, misspellings, and leftover English fragments compromise the listener’s experience. A thorough revision focusing on consistent terminology, elimination of duplicates, and polishing the narrative flow would significantly improve the final product. The current version is serviceable for a general audience but would benefit from editorial tightening to meet professional standards for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience. The average score reflects these mixed strengths and weaknesses and suggests a solid baseline with clear room for improvement: 13/20 overall (average of the five criteria)."
