    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation preserves the overall flow of the dialogue and most sentences are understandable. However, there are a few syntactic quirks (e.g., missing punctuation in questions, a misplaced accent, and some awkward word orders) that can momentarily confuse a native reader. Nonetheless, the general structure and the logical sequence of ideas remain clear.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the majority of the text reads naturally, several expressions feel stilted or non‑idiomatic—\"Es del cram\" (should be something like \"es de crammer\" or \"es de repaso\"), \"Le dimos solo una ‘anticipo’\" (should be \"Le dimos solo una pista\"), and inconsistent verb tenses. These issues slightly interrupt the flow and give the text a more textbook than conversational tone. The vocabulary choice is largely appropriate but could be smoother in a few places.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely translated correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\". The translation stays consistent throughout, though the French‑derived words are retained where they are widely understood in Spanish tech contexts. Minor mis‑spelling such as \"conocencias\" (should be \"conocimientos\") is a small slip, but overall terminology handling is solid.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue is adapted to Spanish‑speaking audiences, but a few cultural references or idiomatic phrases were translated literally (e.g., \"En un nuevo episodio\" instead of a more idiomatic \"En otro episodio\"). The text also misses a few subtle contextual nuances present in the original French, such as the informal tone in some lines. These omissions reduce the cultural resonance slightly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the main points from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, memory, and the consultant versus expert analogy. No critical information is omitted. Some minor phrasing differences (e.g., \"la memoria a corto plazo\" instead of \"la ventana de contexto\") do not change meaning, and redundancies are largely avoided. Overall, the translation is comprehensive.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation successfully conveys the essential content and the flow of the original French dialogue. It captures the technical concepts and the general conversational tone, but there are notable issues with fluency and occasional awkward phrasing that could be polished. Minor spelling and punctuation errors also affect readability. With a few refinements, the text would read as naturally and accurately as possible for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Overall, the translation is good but not perfect, reflecting a solid but slightly uneven execution of the task.\n\nThe overall score, based on the weighted average of the individual criteria, is **16 out of 20**.\n\nThis reflects a competent translation that preserves meaning and structure while leaving room for improvement in naturalness and consistency.\n\n**Score:** 16/20\n\n**Reasoning**: The translation meets most evaluation criteria satisfactorily but is hindered by minor fluency errors, some mis‑spelling, and a few cultural nuances that were not fully adapted. The information remains complete, the terminology is accurate, and the structure is clear. The overall score reflects these strengths and weaknesses.}"
