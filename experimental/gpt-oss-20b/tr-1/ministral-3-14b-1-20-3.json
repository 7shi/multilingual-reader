  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, but several sentences are fragmented, missing punctuation, and contain abrupt interjections (e.g., **Miren:**) that interrupt flow. The phrase *I see* remains untranslated, which can confuse readers. Overall, comprehension is possible but not entirely smooth.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many expressions feel mechanical, especially the repeated use of bold markers and the intermixing of English and Spanish terms (e.g., *pre-training*, *fine‑tuning* in parentheses). Some verb forms are awkward (*Lo olvida todo* instead of *Olvida todo*). The text is readable but lacks the natural rhythm expected in spoken Spanish.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms such as *aprendizaje por transferencia* and *aprendizaje en contexto* are correctly rendered, but others are partially untranslated (*pre‑training*, *fine‑tuning*) or rendered with ambiguous synonyms (*afinado*). Consistency could be improved, but overall the key concepts are preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the overall intent and conversational tone of the original. However, certain cultural cues and idiomatic expressions were not fully adapted—*I see* remains in English, and some exclamations (e.g., **¡Excelente!**) feel out of place. Minor adjustments would strengthen the contextual fit.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script appear in the Spanish version, with no significant omissions. Some additional comments (e.g., “¡Excelente!”) are inserted, but no critical information is missing. The content stays concise and clear, though some redundancy arises from repeated emphasis marks.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main ideas and follows the original structure, but it suffers from uneven terminology translation, occasional English remnants, and stylistic inconsistencies that reduce readability and fluency. With minor edits—standardizing technical terms, removing stray English fragments, and smoothing punctuation—the version would be of high quality and fully natural to a Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\nThe overall quality is good but not perfect, reflecting a solid effort with room for refinement.\n\nOverall Score: 14/20 (average of the five criteria)."
