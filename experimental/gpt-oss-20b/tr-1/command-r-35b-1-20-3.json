    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, but a few sentences are awkwardly structured or incomplete—most notably the fragment ‘Thus, after pre‑training…’ that appears untranslated. The dialogue follows a clear back‑and‑forth pattern, but the missing or broken punctuation makes some passages harder to read. Overall, readers can grasp the meaning, but the flow is slightly disrupted.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several parts sound stilted or carry literal French phrasing. Examples include \"Es una estrategia\" instead of the more natural \"Es una estrategia\" or \"Es una táctica\", and \"La IA no se afinaría constantemente\" which should read \"La IA no se ajusta continuamente\". Accents and article usage are occasionally wrong, and the dialogue lacks the rhythm expected in a native‑speaking podcast script. Nevertheless, most sentences are grammatical and not overly jarring.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"In‑Context Learning\" are present and mostly accurate. Minor issues: \"grounding\" is not consistently translated (it appears as \"anclaje\" in one spot but is missing elsewhere), and the term \"Mémoire\" is simply rendered as \"Memoria\" without context. Overall, terminology is clear and recognizable to the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the conversational tone and the informal podcast vibe. Cultural references are minimal and are handled appropriately. However, some idiomatic expressions from French (e.g., “un jeune diplômé”) are translated literally, which slightly reduces cultural resonance. The speaker names and overall structure remain intact, so the adaptation is largely effective.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is present, but there is a notable missing fragment where the French line \"Thus, after pre‑training…\" remains untranslated and partially garbled. Also a JSON snippet is inserted mid‑dialogue, which may confuse readers. Apart from that, the dialogue covers all key points and does not omit major ideas. Redundancy is minimal, but the incomplete sentence does reduce completeness slightly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers the gist of the original podcast script and maintains a conversational flow suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Nonetheless, it suffers from a few incomplete sentences, some unnatural phrasing, and minor terminology inconsistencies. With small edits—especially correcting the incomplete fragment, smoothing the dialogue, and unifying the terminology—the text would reach a higher level of polish and readability. As it stands, it is serviceable but not perfect for a polished broadcast or publication."
