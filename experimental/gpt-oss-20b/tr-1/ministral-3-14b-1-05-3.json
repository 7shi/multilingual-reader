    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely comprehensible; the structure follows the original dialogue and most complex ideas are conveyed in a clear manner. However, the frequent parenthetical remarks and occasional literal translations (e.g., “affinage” instead of a fully Spanish equivalent) slightly interrupt the flow and can confuse readers who are not fluent in French.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the majority of sentences read naturally, several phrases feel clunky or overly literal (“Esto es una astucia?” “C’est une astuce ?” translated directly). Some punctuation is inconsistent, and the insertion of explanatory parentheses breaks the rhythm of the dialogue. The overall register remains conversational, but a smoother, more idiomatic Spanish could be achieved.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “preentrenamiento,” “fine‑tuning,” “aprendizaje por transferencia,” and “aprendizaje en contexto” are used appropriately. The occasional use of the French word “affinage” (later clarified in parentheses) introduces inconsistency, but the glossary‑style explanation helps. Overall terminology handling is solid, with only minor inconsistencies.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and style, but some cultural nuances could be refined (e.g., replacing “consultor brillante” with “consultor experto” for better resonance). The inclusion of explanatory notes is helpful, yet they are sometimes embedded in the dialogue rather than as footnotes, which may feel forced for Spanish audiences.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Essential information from the French source is preserved; the dialogue covers pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and memory features. Minor omissions are unlikely, but the repeated parenthetical clarifications could be streamlined, and some transitions are slightly less clear, leading to a small loss in clarity.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in conveying the main ideas and maintaining a conversational tone, yet it is marred by a few literal passages, awkward parenthetical insertions, and minor terminology inconsistencies. A more polished Spanish version—free of French remnants and with smoother flow—would significantly enhance readability and naturalness for native listeners or readers. The technical content is largely accurate, but the presentation could benefit from a tighter editing pass and better contextual adaptation to Spanish-speaking audiences. Overall, it is a good but improvable translation."
