  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text frequently mixes Spanish, French and English, causing confusion for readers who expect a coherent Spanish narrative. Sentences such as \"Camille: C'est un sujet fascinant. On perçoit souvent ces IA...\" remain in French, breaking the flow. Several phrases are truncated or grammatically incorrect (e.g., \"¿Porque ya entiende los conceptos...\"), making it hard for native Spanish speakers to follow the dialogue. Overall, readability is significantly impaired.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural constructions and awkward word choices, especially where the original French phrases were not fully rendered into Spanish. The presence of untranslated French and inconsistent punctuation disrupts the natural rhythm of the text. The dialogue sounds disjointed, as if pieced together from different sources. Fluency is therefore poor.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Some key technical terms are correctly translated (e.g., \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\"). However, the term \"ancrage (grounding)\" is left untranslated and is only partially integrated, and other terms remain in French or are not consistently used. The overall terminology handling is inconsistent and not fully adapted to the target audience's level of technical understanding.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to fully adapt the original French cultural references to Spanish-speaking audiences. By leaving several sentences in French and not providing equivalent Spanish expressions or cultural adjustments, the intended humor, tone, and context are not effectively conveyed. The adaptation is minimal and often inadequate.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several parts of the original dialogue are missing or duplicated incorrectly. For instance, the Spanish version contains repeated or misplaced fragments from the French text, and some explanatory lines are omitted or garbled. This leads to omissions of crucial information and a lack of coherence, resulting in incomplete content compared to the source.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a basic attempt at converting the French script into Spanish, but it is severely hampered by a mixture of languages, grammatical inaccuracies, and inconsistent terminology. The result is a text that is difficult to read, unfluent, and partially incomplete. Significant revision is needed to achieve a clear, coherent, and faithful Spanish rendition of the original dialogue. The overall quality falls well below acceptable standards for professional translation work, requiring extensive editing and re‑translation of key sections. The translation could benefit from a thorough review of linguistic consistency, cultural adaptation, and technical accuracy to meet the expectations of a Spanish-speaking audience."
