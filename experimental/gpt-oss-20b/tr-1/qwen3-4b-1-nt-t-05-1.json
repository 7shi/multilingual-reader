  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely comprehensible and follows the logical flow of the original. Sentences are mostly clear, and technical concepts are explained in a way that non‑specialist readers can follow. However, a few constructions feel slightly clunky (e.g., “se le ha proporcionado una preparación justo antes de que ella comience a hablar con ustedes”) and some pronoun choices (formal “usted” vs. informal “tú”) break the narrative rhythm. These minor issues reduce overall readability.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the bulk of the text sounds natural, several phrases are awkward or grammatically incorrect: inconsistent formality (“Usted ha entendido todo” vs. earlier informal “tú”), gender mismatches (“enviarla” instead of “enviarlo”), and literal translations that feel stilted (“El aprendizaje por transferencia es la clave. Mira: no enseñarías las matemáticas básicas…”). These errors hinder the smoothness expected of a polished Spanish script.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled accurately and consistently: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *ventana de contexto*, *anclaje*. The only minor inconsistency is the capitalization of ICL. Overall, terminology usage is appropriate for a tech‑savvy audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the core intent of the original dialogue and adapts several idiomatic expressions (e.g., “bachoter”, “ventana de contexto”). Nevertheless, cultural nuances are not fully optimized: the switch between formal and informal speech and some literal wording (e.g., “enviarla”) diminish the naturalness for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The adaptation could be improved by maintaining consistent tone and more idiomatic phrasing.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the source text is present. No major omissions or distortions were identified. The translation sometimes adds subtle clarifications (e.g., explaining that ICL is temporary) which aid understanding, while redundancy is largely avoided.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation faithfully reproduces the content of the original French script and manages technical terminology well. Readability is good, but fluency suffers from inconsistent formality, gender errors, and a few literal phrasings that break natural flow. The overall message is preserved, yet the script could be polished to meet native‑speaker expectations fully. A moderate revision focused on tone consistency and grammatical accuracy would elevate the quality significantly.\n\nOverall Score: 16.2/20 (rounded to 16)."
