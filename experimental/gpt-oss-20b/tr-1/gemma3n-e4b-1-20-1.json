    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but several sentences are incomplete or oddly structured, which hampers smooth reading. The omission of key explanatory segments (e.g., the description of fine‑tuning and context learning) makes some passages confusing. Overall, the text could be followed by an attentive reader, but it lacks the clarity and flow expected in a polished transcript.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains multiple literal French remnants such as \"Exactement\" and \"Oui, et elle est rendue possible par…\" that are not translated into Spanish. Additionally, some phrases feel clunky or grammatically off (e.g., \"el ajuste fino... es aquí donde interviene…\" is repeated with inconsistent punctuation). These issues break the natural flow and reduce the overall fluency of the text.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms such as \"pré‑entraînement\" → \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\" → \"ajuste fino\", and \"in‑context learning\" → \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly translated. However, the missing explanation of fine‑tuning and the inconsistent use of gendered pronouns for \"la IA\" weaken the technical consistency. The terminology is adequate but not fully cohesive.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to localize cultural references (e.g., references to the Spanish podcast format) but fails to adjust some idiomatic expressions and maintains French syntax in places. The overall intent of the original is preserved, yet the lack of Spanish idiomatic flow and the presence of untranslated French fragments compromise contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several parts of the original are omitted or truncated—most notably the detailed explanation of fine‑tuning, the mechanics of in‑context learning, and the discussion about memory features. The presence of incomplete sentences and repeated fragments indicates missing information. The translator also added redundant lines that were not in the source.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a basic understanding of the source material but falls short in several key areas: it includes untranslated French segments, incomplete passages, and unnatural phrasing. While the main ideas are largely conveyed, the lack of full completeness, consistency, and fluency reduces the overall quality. Significant revision is needed to produce a polished, reader‑friendly transcript suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
