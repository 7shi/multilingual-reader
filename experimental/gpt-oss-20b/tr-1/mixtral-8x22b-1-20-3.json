  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, but there are a few hiccups. The repeated speaker label \"Camille: Camille:\" and some awkward verb choices (e.g., \"Miren\" instead of \"Imaginen\") interrupt the flow. Sentence structure is generally clear, but these small errors reduce overall readability slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly in most places, but occasional unnatural phrasing (such as \"Miren\" and \"informaciones\" in the plural) and the duplicated speaker tag make the text feel less natural to a native speaker. Grammar is mostly correct, yet these quirks lower fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled very well: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", and the use of \"ICL (In‑Context Learning)\" are all appropriate. Only a minor inconsistency appears with \"grounding\" rendered as \"anclaje (fijación)\", which is understandable but could be simplified.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and tone of the original are preserved, and cultural references are adapted appropriately for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The slight duplication of speaker labels and a few literal translations (e.g., \"ventana de contexto\" for \"context window\") are minor issues that do not alter meaning.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines and key points from the French source are present. No substantive information is omitted, and redundant parts are retained in a concise form. The only issue is formatting (duplicate speaker tags), which does not affect content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is overall accurate and retains the original meaning and flow. However, small typographical and grammatical mistakes—especially the duplicated speaker label and some slightly awkward word choices—hinder readability and fluency. Correcting these would bring the translation to a near‑perfect level while maintaining all technical accuracy and contextual nuance. The translation is suitable for a general audience, with just a few refinements needed for optimal polish."
