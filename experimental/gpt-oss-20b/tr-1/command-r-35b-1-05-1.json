    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and captures the main ideas of the original. However, a few sentences contain awkward word order or missing punctuation, which can momentarily confuse the reader. For example, the phrase \"El aprendizaje en contexto es como el cramming!\" mixes an English term with Spanish, reducing clarity. Overall, the text is understandable but not perfectly smooth.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural to a Spanish speaker, but there are several spots where the phrasing feels literal or clunky. \"Aprendizaje In-Context\" is an English construction that does not exist in Spanish; the standard would be \"Aprendizaje en contexto\". Also, \"la IA no se perfecciona ni mejora con base en sus conversaciones\" is correct, but earlier segments use an unnecessarily formal tone that feels slightly disjointed. These issues lower the fluency score.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine-tuning\" (translated as \"especialización\"), \"in-context learning\" (as \"aprendizaje en contexto\"). However, inconsistencies appear (e.g., \"preentrenamiento\" vs \"pre-entrenamiento\"), and the use of \"Aprendizaje In-Context\" is not idiomatic. Explanations of complex ideas are generally adequate, but the term consistency could be tighter. Hence the score is moderate.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator retained the original podcast title \"Tech Éclair\" in the final line, which breaks the pattern of fully adapting to Spanish. Some idiomatic expressions are kept, such as \"construir una habilidad permanente\" and the metaphor of a consultant, which fit well culturally. However, the mix of English and Spanish terms (e.g., \"cramming\") and the retention of the original title suggest incomplete adaptation. Therefore the score reflects this mixed result.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French script are present in the Spanish translation: pre-training, fine-tuning, transfer learning, in-context learning, grounding, memory, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. The translator does not omit any critical detail, and redundancies are minimal. The only potential loss is the subtlety of the original French phrasing in a few places, but overall the content is complete.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and largely faithful to the source material. It preserves the core concepts and overall structure, making it readable for a Spanish-speaking audience. Nonetheless, several linguistic quirks—especially the use of non‑Spanish terminology and a few awkward phrasings—slightly detract from the natural flow. With minor refinements to terminology consistency and fluency, the translation would achieve a higher level of polish. Current overall quality: moderate with room for improvement. The translator demonstrates a good grasp of technical content but would benefit from a more thorough adaptation to Spanish idioms and consistent terminology usage. Overall score: 13/20."
