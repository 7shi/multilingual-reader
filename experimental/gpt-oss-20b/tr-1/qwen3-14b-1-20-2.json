    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to read and follows the original structure. Long sentences occasionally make the flow a bit stiff, but the meaning remains clear for native readers.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds mostly natural, yet a few constructions feel awkward (e.g., \"Lo entendieron todo\" and the invented verb \"bacar\"). There are minor grammatical inconsistencies and some literal transfers that could be smoothed out.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"grounding\", \"memoria\". However, the use of \"bacar\" is incorrect, and the abbreviation ICL is not consistently translated. Overall, terminology is largely accurate but with some slip‑ups.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue’s casual, conversational tone is preserved, and cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor phrasing such as \"¿Qué pasa con nuevas funcionalidades\" could be more idiomatic. The adaptation is effective but not perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the original are present; no major omissions. The translation provides adequate explanations for technical concepts and retains the episode’s structure. Some redundancy is retained, but the content stays concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the original meaning well and maintains the conversational style, but it suffers from a few awkward phrases and a minor terminology error. With small edits for fluency and terminology consistency, it would be an excellent rendition of the source text for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Overall, it is a solid translation that effectively delivers the intended message and technical detail while remaining readable and engaging. The translation’s strengths lie in its faithful representation of the episode’s flow and its clear explanations of complex AI concepts. The main areas for improvement are smoothing out unnatural sentence structures and correcting the erroneous use of \"bacar\". The overall quality of the translation is good, and with minor refinements it could reach an excellent standard for professional or educational use.\n\nOverall score: 17/20 (average of the five criteria)."
