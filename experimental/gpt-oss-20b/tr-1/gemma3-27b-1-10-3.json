  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow, with clear sentence structures and logical flow. Some sentences feel a bit literal or could be tightened (e.g., \"Se puede tomar un modelo experto en inglés y luego presentarle...\" could read smoother as \"Un modelo experto en inglés puede ser expuesto a menos texto en francés…\"), but overall readers can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural to native Spanish speakers. A few expressions are slightly awkward or overly literal, such as \"Se puede decir eso\" or \"la IA no se afina constantemente con sus conversaciones\" (more idiomatic would be \"la IA no se entrena constantemente con sus conversaciones\"). Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary, but small stylistic refinements would improve smoothness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\". The adaptation of \"grounding\" to \"anclaje\" and \"Memory\" to \"Memoria\" is sensible. No significant terminology errors or omissions are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the conversational tone and intent of the original podcast. Cultural adaptation is handled well – terms like \"consultor\" and idiomatic references (e.g., \"montar en bicicleta\") resonate with Spanish-speaking audiences. Minor tweaks could enhance cultural resonance (e.g., using regional variations for certain expressions), but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French transcript are present. The Spanish version does not omit any critical information and keeps the same level of detail. Minor paraphrasing for clarity does not alter meaning. The content remains concise yet comprehensive.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the original content while maintaining readability and naturalness for a Spanish-speaking audience. Small stylistic adjustments could raise the fluency score, but the overall result is accurate, clear, and well‑adapted to the target language and culture. The translation would be suitable for publication or broadcast in Spanish-speaking regions without further revision, aside from minor polishing for optimal readability and flow."
