  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable. Sentences are mostly short and clear, and the logical flow mirrors the French original. Some phrases, however, feel slightly clunky (e.g., *“Lo entendiste todo.”*, *“el sistema busca rápidamente en sus antiguos intercambios”*), which can momentarily disrupt comprehension. Nonetheless, a native reader can follow the discussion without confusion.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is fairly fluent, but there are a few noticeable non‑native constructions: *‘Hola y bienvenido en’* (should be *‘a’*), *‘Lo entendiste todo’* (more natural: *‘Lo has entendido todo’*), and *‘le han dado solo un prompt justo antes’* (clumsy). Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary, but these small grammatical slips lower the overall naturalness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, and *ICL* are correctly rendered. The word *anclaje* is used consistently, though the later use of *‘fundamento’* for *grounding* is a slight inconsistency. Overall terminology is appropriate and clear for a general audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone. Cultural adaptations are minimal; the name of the podcast is kept in French, which could be translated into Spanish (*«Tech Éclair»* remains unchanged). Minor phrasing adjustments would improve readability for Spanish listeners, but the content is well‑adapted to the target culture.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. There is no significant omission, and the explanation of concepts is retained. Minor details like *‘se abre una nueva ventana de discusión’* could be streamlined, but the overall message is complete and concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid overall, accurately conveying the technical concepts and conversational tone of the original. Minor linguistic and stylistic adjustments would raise the fluency and readability, but the work is functional and understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The main issues are occasional awkward phrasing and a few small terminology inconsistencies. With minor refinements, this translation could achieve a high level of quality suitable for publication or broadcast in Spanish."
