    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely understandable, but several sentences are awkwardly constructed (e.g., “La IA no se afinada” instead of “La IA no se afina”). The logical flow is preserved, but occasional syntactic errors make the text slightly harder to follow for native readers. Overall, it remains comprehensible with moderate effort.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The prose is generally smooth, but there are grammatical mistakes and unnatural phrasing in a few places (“la IA no se afinada”, “le proporcionan la información que necesita”), which interrupt the natural flow for a Spanish speaker. The vocabulary is mostly appropriate, yet some word choices feel literal rather than idiomatic. Thus the text is fluent but not flawless.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms such as *pre-entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto* and *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)* are correctly rendered. The translation keeps consistency in terminology and includes translations for terms like “grounding” (anclaje). Minor issues: the term “Memoria” is capitalized inconsistently and “grounding” is not fully localized. Overall, terminology handling is good.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the target audience’s linguistic norms and adapts expressions appropriately (e.g., using *consultor brillante* instead of a literal translation). However, some culturally specific phrasings (such as “¿Es entonces un truco?”) feel a bit informal and could be refined. The overall intent and tone are preserved, but the adaptation could be slightly more polished.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present in the Spanish version. No essential information is omitted, and the same logical progression of ideas is maintained. Minor omissions are limited to grammatical errors that do not affect the meaning. Thus the translation is complete and concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation effectively conveys the original content and terminology, but suffers from a handful of grammatical slips and some slightly awkward phrasing that diminish its fluency. While readability and completeness are strong, the text would benefit from a final proofreading pass to correct the minor errors and polish a few informal turns. Overall, the translation is competent and understandable but not yet polished to native‑speaker quality. This reflects a solid effort with room for refinement in fluency and contextual nuance."
