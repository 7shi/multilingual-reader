  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely understandable, but some key explanations are missing or truncated (e.g., the transfer‑learning example after \"¿Qué quieres decir?\") and a few sentences lack context, making certain passages harder to follow.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish is mostly natural and flows well, yet there are a few awkward constructions (e.g., duplicated \"Luc:\" prefixes, \"Las conocimientos\" instead of \"Los conocimientos\"). Overall the text sounds conversational, but the minor errors interrupt fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"in‑context learning\" are correctly rendered. Inconsistencies appear in article usage (e.g., missing \"El\" before \"pre‑entrenamiento\"). The terminology is accurate but could be more consistently applied.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and maintains the conversational tone appropriate for a podcast audience. Cultural nuances are generally respected, though some phrases were translated literally (e.g., \"la forma anclada\" vs. \"anclada\"). The adaptation is effective but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several parts of the original dialogue are omitted or incomplete, notably the explanatory segment after \"¿Qué quieres decir?\" and the opening of the \"pre‑entrenamiento\" discussion. These gaps reduce the completeness of the information conveyed.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys most of the content accurately and sounds natural to a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, key omissions, grammatical slips, and some duplicated text diminish its overall quality. With a few edits—especially filling in the missing explanations and correcting minor errors—the translation would reach a higher level of precision and completeness. The current version scores 15/20 as a whole, reflecting strong performance with room for improvement in completeness and polish. "
