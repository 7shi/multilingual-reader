  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the overall structure of the original dialogue, making it easy to follow. Sentences are generally well‑formed and the progression of ideas is clear. However, some longer sentences could be broken down for even better clarity, and a few punctuation errors (missing spaces after periods, misplaced commas) slightly reduce readability.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly natural and smooth. The translator has chosen appropriate idiomatic expressions in most places. Nevertheless, a few awkward phrasings appear, such as \"La IA no se afinada constantemente\" (should be \"La IA no se afina constantemente\") and inconsistent use of capitalisation in terms like \"preentrenamiento\". These minor issues lower the overall fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"ventana de contexto\". The translator occasionally leaves English terms untranslated (e.g., \"fine‑tuning\"), but these are still understandable. Consistency could be improved by fully translating all technical phrases, yet the overall terminology remains accurate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone, suitable for a general Spanish‑speaking audience. It does not over‑localise or misinterpret cultural references, which is appropriate given the technical subject matter. The only minor adaptation issue is the lack of an explicit cultural localisation for phrases such as \"consultant brillante\", but this does not materially affect comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory features, and the analogy with a temporary consultant. No substantial information is omitted. Minor omissions or rephrasing (e.g., the phrase “fine‑tuning” retained in English) do not detract from understanding, but a more consistent translation would improve completeness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the Spanish translation is solid and faithful to the source text. It effectively conveys the technical concepts and maintains the conversational style of the original podcast script. Minor grammatical and consistency issues exist, but they are limited in scope and do not impede comprehension. With a few refinements in terminology consistency and punctuation, the translation would achieve a higher level of polish and naturalness for native Spanish speakers."
