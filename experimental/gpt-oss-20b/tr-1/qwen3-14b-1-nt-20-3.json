  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, with clear sentence structure and logical flow. However, a few long sentences and a minor grammatical error (“Entienden todo”) can momentarily disrupt comprehension. Overall, readers would grasp the concepts with minimal effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most expressions read naturally, but there are some awkward phrasings: “Entienden todo” is grammatically incorrect in this context and “El modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona” sounds slightly formal. Vocabulary is generally appropriate, yet a few word choices (e.g., “afinado” for fine‑tuning) feel less idiomatic.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and explained, e.g., *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *ventana de contexto*. The choice of “afinado” for *fine‑tuning* is understandable but less common than *ajuste fino*. Overall terminology is consistent and suitable for a general audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original tone and intent. Cultural references remain appropriate, and the conversational style is maintained. Minor issues include the repetition of “por lo tanto” and the aforementioned grammatical slip, but they do not substantially alter meaning.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No major omissions or additions are evident. The text is concise yet comprehensive.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is clear and largely faithful to the original French script. It conveys complex AI concepts effectively for a general audience. Minor fluency and terminology adjustments could improve naturalness, but overall the translation meets high standards of readability and accuracy."
