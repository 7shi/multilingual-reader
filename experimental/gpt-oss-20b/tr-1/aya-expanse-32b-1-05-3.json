    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the overall structure of the dialogue and most of the sentence flows. However, there are several grammatical errors that impede readability, such as the wrong use of the pronoun in “Lo habéis entendido todo” (should be singular “has”) and the misspelling “El afino” instead of “el ajuste fino.” These mistakes can confuse readers, especially in a conversational context. Additionally, some phrases are slightly clunky (e.g., “Lo habéis” appears twice in a row). Overall, the text is understandable but not smooth.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally understandable but contains awkward or incorrect expressions that break natural flow. Examples include “Lo habéis” (incorrect form) and “El afino” (incorrect term). The word choices are mostly appropriate, but the repetition of errors reduces overall fluency. The dialogue could sound more natural with corrections and smoother phrasing.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly rendered. The acronym ICL is translated appropriately. The main issue is the mis‑translation of \"fine-tuning\" as \"El afino\" and the omission of a hyphen in \"preentrenamiento\". Apart from these, terminology is consistent and accurate.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the informal tone of a podcast conversation and adapts some expressions to Spanish. However, the repeated use of the wrong pronoun and the odd term “El afino” detract from cultural appropriateness. The overall intent is conveyed, but the translation could be more polished to match native conversational style.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French transcript are present; no substantial information is omitted. Minor omissions are not apparent, and the dialogue remains concise. The only missing nuance is the small grammatical errors that could slightly alter meaning but do not affect overall understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation successfully conveys the structure and content of the original French script but suffers from several grammatical and lexical errors that hinder readability and naturalness. While technical terminology is largely preserved, the incorrect usage of pronouns and terms (especially \"El afino\") and occasional clunky phrasing detract from fluency. With minor edits, the translation would reach a high level of quality and clarity. Current score: 14.5/20. The main recommendation is to review pronoun usage, correct terminology, and smooth out awkward phrases to improve overall naturalness and readability. The essential information remains intact and comprehensible for Spanish-speaking audiences, though a polished version would better serve a native audience's expectations for a professional podcast transcript."
