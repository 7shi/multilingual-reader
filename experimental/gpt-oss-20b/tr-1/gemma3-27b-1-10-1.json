  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version keeps the conversational flow of the original and uses clear explanations for technical concepts. Sentences are generally understandable, though some are long and could be broken up for better pacing. Minor phrasing issues (e.g., “Se puede decir eso”) slightly reduce clarity.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural for a Spanish-speaking audience overall. The choice of vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. However, a few awkward constructions (e.g., “Se puede decir eso”, hyphenated “pre-entrenamiento”) and occasional literal phrasing make it feel slightly less smooth than ideal.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, y memoria a corto plazo are correctly rendered and consistently used. The term “grounding” remains untranslated and “anti-sèche” is not explicitly mentioned, which are minor slips in terminology precision.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original intent and tone well, keeping the podcast feel. Cultural references are appropriate, and the Spanish audience can follow the discussion. Slight improvements could be made in phrasing (“intercambios” vs “interacciones”) but overall adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present, including the discussion of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and memory features. No major omissions are detected, and the text remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is generally faithful and clear, conveying the technical concepts and conversational style of the original podcast. Minor refinements in phrasing, terminology consistency, and the elimination of some literal expressions would elevate the quality to near‑perfect fluency and naturalness. Overall, it serves well for Spanish‑speaking audiences who are interested in AI model training processes."
