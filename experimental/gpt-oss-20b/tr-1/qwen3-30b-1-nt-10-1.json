  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly easy to read. Sentence structures follow a logical flow and complex ideas (e.g., pre‑training, in‑context learning) are explained in straightforward language. A few minor awkward phrases (e.g., “Han entendido todo”) slightly disrupt the natural rhythm but do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation sounds natural to a native Spanish speaker, but there are some noticeable grammatical slips: the plural verb “Han” where a singular “Has” is required, and a few literal translations that feel a bit stiff. Vocabulary is generally appropriate and contemporary. Overall fluency is high but not perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and accurately translated (“pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”). The word “grounding” is introduced in parentheses after “anclaje”, which might be confusing for readers unfamiliar with the English term. Terminology consistency is good, though a few terms could be more fully localized (e.g., “fine‑tuning” could simply be “ajuste fino”).",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the original intent and preserves cultural references (e.g., the podcast name “Tech Éclair”, the hosts’ names). Minor adaptations are made to suit Spanish-speaking audiences, but no major cultural shifts are necessary. The adaptation is effective and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the consultant versus expert analogy. No substantive information is omitted, and the overall message remains intact. Redundancy is minimal and the content is concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely faithful, clear, and well‑structured. Minor grammatical errors and a few slightly awkward phrasings reduce the overall fluency score, but the technical terminology and contextual meaning are well preserved. With a few polishing touches, the text would read smoothly to a native Spanish audience and accurately convey the original French podcast’s message. Overall, a strong translation that balances fidelity and readability."
