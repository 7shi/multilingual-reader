  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable; sentences flow logically and the main concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) are explained clearly. Minor readability issues appear in a few places, such as the phrase “¿Luco, esto explica…”, which should read “¿Luc, esto explica…”. Overall the target audience can follow the discussion without confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds mostly natural, with appropriate vocabulary and contemporary wording. Some awkward constructions and minor grammatical slips (“la IA no es entrenada continuamente por sus conversaciones” instead of “afinada”) slightly interrupt the flow. The overall tone is conversational and suitable for a podcast transcript.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled accurately: “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, and “anclaje”. The usage is consistent, though the translation occasionally chooses less common variants (“preentrenamiento” vs. “pre‑entrenamiento”). Explanations for specialized terms are clear and helpful.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally preserves the original intent and style. However, there are inconsistencies with the show title (“Tech Relámpago” vs. “Tecnología Relámpago”) and a typographical error (“¿Luco”). Cultural adaptation is adequate, but these small issues detract from a polished final product.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential content from the French original is present in the Spanish translation. No major omissions are noted, and the speaker turns are maintained. The inclusion of parenthetical translations (ICL, etc.) aids comprehension, and redundancy is avoided.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and mostly faithful to the source, capturing the conversational tone and technical details. Minor readability, fluency, and contextual inconsistencies reduce the overall polish, but the message remains clear and accurate for a native Spanish audience. With a few corrections (show title consistency, typographical fixes, smoother phrasing) it would achieve a high level of quality."
