    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original’s logical flow. However, several sentences are long and some word choices (e.g., *se enviando*, *u*, *antisèche*) create minor confusion, lowering overall clarity. 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains noticeable grammatical errors such as *se enviando* instead of *se envía* and the use of the pronoun *u* in place of *has* or *has entendido*. Some phrases sound mechanical rather than natural (e.g., *v* for *usted*). Overall, the prose is understandable but lacks smoothness. 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely retained or translated appropriately (*pre-entrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *anclaje*). The word *fine‑tuning* is kept in English, which is acceptable in tech contexts, and abbreviations such as ICL are preserved. Minor inconsistencies (e.g., *antisèche* untranslated) exist but do not severely affect comprehension. 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, and references are culturally suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience. Some phrasing could be more idiomatic, and the use of *u* may feel odd to native speakers. Overall, adaptation is good but not flawless. 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original dialogue are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory, and the comparison between temporary and permanent knowledge. No essential information is omitted, and the content remains concise. 19/20.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main ideas and technical content effectively, but it suffers from grammatical inaccuracies and some awkward phrasing that detract from readability and fluency. With minor revisions, the Spanish version could reach a higher level of polish while maintaining its technical accuracy and cultural relevance. Overall, it is a solid draft that would benefit from a thorough copy‑editing pass to address the noted issues. 15.8/20."
