    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, some sentences are unusually short or lack connecting phrases, and there are a few missing accent marks (e.g., \"el pre‑entrenamiento\" instead of \"el preentrenamiento\"). These minor issues slightly hinder the smooth flow of ideas.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The overall cadence of the translation is acceptable, but several expressions feel awkward or unidiomatic for native speakers. Phrases such as \"Lo has entendido todo\" and the inconsistent use of quotation marks distract from a natural reading experience. The vocabulary is largely appropriate, but the rhythm could be improved.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered and consistently used: \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", etc. The occasional typo \"pre‑entrenamiento\" could be \"preentrenamiento\", but the terminology otherwise meets the expectations for a Spanish‑speaking technical audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the informal, conversational tone of the original podcast and adapts many expressions to Spanish culture (e.g., using \"repaso para un examen\" for \"bachotage\"). Some idiomatic adjustments are missing, but overall the sense and style are preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present; no essential information is omitted. A few typographical slips and a missing quotation mark reduce the precision slightly, but the content remains comprehensive and concise.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is understandable and retains the core ideas of the original French script. Minor fluency issues, punctuation inconsistencies, and occasional typographical errors slightly affect the quality, but the technical accuracy and contextual adaptation are solid. With a few editorial tweaks, it could reach a near‑perfect score for a natural, polished podcast script in Spanish. The overall score reflects these strengths and the minor weaknesses observed during the evaluation. The translation would benefit from a careful copy‑editing pass to correct accents, punctuation, and wording that feel slightly unnatural to native readers. Nonetheless, it effectively conveys the intended message to a Spanish‑speaking audience, making it a useful and functional adaptation for the podcast format.  The overall score is 16 out of 20, indicating a competent, but not flawless, translation that would serve well with a brief proofreading stage to polish the final text.  The evaluation reflects the translation's strengths in technical terminology and contextual adaptation, while pointing out specific fluency and readability improvements that could be made for an even smoother reading experience."
