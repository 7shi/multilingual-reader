  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version contains many incomplete sentences, missing verbs and punctuation, making it difficult to read. The conversational flow is disrupted by abrupt cuts and repetition, which hampers comprehension for native listeners. A score of 8/20 reflects these readability issues.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is not fluent; several sentences are fragmented or use unnatural phrasing (e.g., \"El modelo en sí no aprende ni evoluciona\" is fine, but \"Camille: La diferencia entre aprender de memoria para un examen y dominar realmente un tema ?\" lacks proper Spanish syntax). Overall, the text sounds stilted and includes untranslated fragments, earning a 7/20.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"in‑context learning\" are largely preserved. However, some translations are awkward or incomplete (e.g., \"ancrage (grounding)\" not fully explained, and a stray \"llevar\" appears). Consistency is moderate, resulting in a score of 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sometimes misses the cultural nuance needed for a Spanish‑speaking audience, and the abrupt insertion of meta‑commentary about the translation process betrays a lack of contextual adaptation. The dialogue does not feel natural for the target audience, so 6/20 is appropriate.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original are omitted or duplicated; the text includes extraneous commentary that was not in the source. Key lines are missing (e.g., the explanation of “grounding”), leading to a substantial loss of information. The score reflects this: 4/20.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates several fundamental problems: missing content, extraneous commentary, and fragmented sentences. While some technical terms are retained correctly, the overall readability, fluency, and completeness are severely compromised. The translation would require a thorough rewrite to serve as a faithful, natural, and coherent Spanish version of the original French podcast script. The overall quality is therefore quite low, with many corrections needed before it could be used in a production setting. A total of 37 out of 100 reflects these shortcomings, highlighting the need for a comprehensive revision and re‑editing process to achieve the intended clarity and accuracy of the original content. The translator should also remove the embedded translation commentary and ensure all dialogues are fully rendered and logically ordered."
