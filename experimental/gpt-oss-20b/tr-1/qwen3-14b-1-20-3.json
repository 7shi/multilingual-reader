    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to read and follows the same logical structure as the original.  The concepts are clearly explained, but a few sentences (e.g. “Lo entendieron todo”) feel slightly clunky and could confuse a native reader.  Overall the text is comprehensible with minor issues.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly natural, but there are noticeable awkward or incorrect phrases such as “Lo entendieron todo” and “bacar” which is not a Spanish word.  The sentence “Lo entendieron todo” should be singular, and “bacar” should be corrected.  These errors reduce the overall smoothness of the text.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly for the most part.  Pre‑training is translated as “preentrenamiento”, fine‑tuning as “afinamiento”, ICL as “aprendizaje en contexto”, and grounding as “anclaje”.  These choices are appropriate and consistent, though “ajuste fino” could be a more common alternative for fine‑tuning.  The terminology is clear for a general audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and tone of the original are preserved.  The cultural adaptation is good, but a few phrases feel less natural, such as “Lo entendieron todo” (should be singular) and the non‑existent word “bacar”.  Aside from those, the translation respects the Spanish‑speaking audience’s conventions.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original is present.  No major omissions or added content that changes meaning.  The translation remains concise while covering the same content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is fairly accurate and conveys the technical content well.  It benefits from a clear structure and generally appropriate terminology.  However, a handful of grammatical and lexical mistakes (e.g., “bacar” and improper verb agreement) reduce its fluency and polish.  With minor revisions, the text would read smoothly for a native Spanish audience.  Overall, it is a solid translation that could be improved by correcting the identified errors and refining some awkward phrasing.  This brings the overall quality to a high but not perfect level.  Score: 17/20."
