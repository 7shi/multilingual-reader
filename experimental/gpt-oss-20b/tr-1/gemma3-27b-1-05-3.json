  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is mostly easy to read and follows the original’s conversational flow. Sentence structures are clear, and complex concepts are explained with minimal ambiguity. A few lines feel slightly wordy or redundant, but overall readers can follow the dialogue without confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the translation sounds understandable, several spots exhibit unnatural phrasing or missing accents (e.g., \"¿Porque\" instead of \"¿Por qué\"). Some sentences have awkward syntax (“Lo has entendido todo.”) and the switch between \"ajuste fino\" and \"afinamiento\" creates a subtle inconsistency. These issues slightly hinder the natural flow for native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved correctly: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\". The translation occasionally mixes \"ajuste fino\" and \"afinamiento\", but both are accepted. Explanations for specialized terms are provided where necessary, and terminology remains consistent within each paragraph.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original tone and humor, using culturally familiar expressions (e.g., “consultor brillante”). It adapts idiomatic phrasing appropriately for a Spanish audience, although a few references could be more localized. Overall, the intent and purpose are effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant content from the original is omitted. All dialogues, explanations, and examples are present, and the translation adds no extraneous information. Minor repetition exists but does not detract from clarity.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation faithfully conveys the content and technical concepts of the original French script. Minor fluency issues and slight terminology inconsistencies reduce the overall polish, but the text remains clear, complete, and understandable for a Spanish-speaking audience."
