  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely easy to follow. Sentence structures are logical and the main ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory) are clearly explained. Minor repetition of phrases (“la IA se acuerda…”) slightly disrupts flow, but overall the dialogue can be understood by a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Some expressions feel forced or non‑idiomatic, e.g., “la IA se acuerda” instead of “recuerda”, “es una forma astuciosa de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado” and the accidental inclusion of the English word “Simply”. These affect naturalness. The rest of the translation reads smoothly and uses contemporary vocabulary.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly rendered accurately and consistently: “preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “anclaje”. The only inconsistency is the hyphen in “pre-entrenamiento” versus “preentrenamiento”. Overall, terminology is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and conversational tone, adapting idiomatic expressions (e.g., “consultor brillante”) that fit Spanish culture. Cultural references are appropriate and the adaptation does not alter meaning. Minor stylistic choices could be smoother.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present: explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory features, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No critical content is omitted, and redundancy is kept minimal.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is generally faithful and understandable, with clear explanations of complex concepts. It excels in technical accuracy and context preservation, but could benefit from smoothing out some awkward phrasing and eliminating stray English words. With a few refinements, it would be a polished, natural‑sounding Spanish transcript."
