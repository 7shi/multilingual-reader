  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is mostly easy to follow, with clear sentence structures and logical progression. However, some repeated lines (e.g., “Ella olvida todo” twice) and missing context (e.g., omitted sentences about the power of transfer learning) slightly reduce clarity. Overall, readers can grasp the main ideas but may notice gaps.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the majority of the translation reads smoothly, there are several awkward expressions and grammatical errors: gender mismatches (“enviarla”), misspellings (“conocencias”), and unnatural phrasing (“el aprendizaje en contexto, es el bachotage”). These detract from a native‑speaker feeling. The overall fluency is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly preserved (“preentrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “transferencia”, “ICL”). Minor errors occur: “Las lenguas” instead of “Los idiomas”, “conocimientos” gender mistakes, and the informal “bachear”. Terminology consistency is acceptable but could be tightened.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator generally respects the original intent, but some culturally awkward choices appear (“silla” for the bicycle saddle, “estabilidad” instead of “equilibrio”). The dialogue format is kept, and jokes or colloquialisms are translated reasonably well. Adaptation is adequate but not flawless.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Two important sentences from the source are missing: the explanation of the power of transfer learning and the reference to solid foundations. Additionally, some sections are duplicated unnecessarily. These omissions reduce completeness and could confuse listeners. The overall content is largely present but not entirely complete.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is understandable and captures most of the original content, but several omissions, repetitions, and grammatical issues reduce its quality. It would benefit from a careful revision to correct gender agreements, remove redundancies, and restore the missing sentences to improve both completeness and naturalness for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The technical terminology is largely correct, yet the translation could be smoother and more faithful to the original nuances with a final polish. Overall, it’s a solid draft that needs refinement to reach a professional standard for a podcast audience.\n\nOverall score: 13/20 (average of the individual criteria)."
