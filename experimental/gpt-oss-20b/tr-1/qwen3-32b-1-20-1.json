  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to read and follows the original structure closely. Sentence flow is logical and the dialogue format is preserved, making it comprehensible for a native Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor issues: the opening greeting “Hola y bienvenidos” is slightly formal for a single speaker, but still readable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly overall. However, a few phrases feel slightly awkward or Anglicized: e.g., “cheat sheet” is a literal borrowing that could be rendered as “hoja de trucos” or “resumen rápido.” Additionally, “El modelo en sí” sounds a bit formal for conversational speech. These do not severely impede understanding but reduce naturalness slightly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled well. \"Fine‑tuning\" as \"afinamiento\" is understandable, though the more common Spanish translation is \"ajuste fino\". \"In‑Context Learning\" is correctly rendered as \"aprendizaje en contexto\". The terminology stays consistent throughout, and no major terms are omitted or mistranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone. Cultural adaptation is adequate; the script remains informal and engaging. Minor stylistic adjustments could improve localization, but overall the Spanish version captures the podcast’s friendly, explanatory vibe.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the content from the French original is present. No essential detail is omitted. The only subtle difference is the choice of \"entrenamiento previo\" for \"pré‑entraînement,\" which conveys the same idea. The script remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "This is a solid translation that faithfully conveys the original dialogue while maintaining readability and technical clarity. Minor naturalness issues and a slightly uncommon term choice reduce the score marginally, but the overall quality is very good. The translation would comfortably serve a Spanish‑speaking audience, keeping the podcast’s informative and approachable tone intact, with a final overall rating of 18/20 points. Good work! 👏🏻"
