  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely easy to read, with clear sentence structures. However, the abrupt duplicate lines (e.g., \"Camille: Camille:\"), the presence of untranslated French fragments, and the missing block of content after \"Camille: ¿Quieres decir?\" interrupt the flow and make some parts hard to follow. This lowers overall readability.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the Spanish is natural and flows well, but occasional awkward word choices (e.g., \"informaciones\" instead of the singular form, \"empollar\" as a noun) and the inserted French phrases detract from a fully fluent experience. The repetition of speaker labels also feels clunky.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"pré-entraînement\", \"fine-tuning\", and \"In‑Context Learning\" are mostly correctly rendered. Minor inconsistencies appear (e.g., \"las lenguas\" for languages, \"informaciones\" instead of \"información\"). The terminology is broadly appropriate but could benefit from more consistent and idiomatic choices.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally adapts cultural references appropriately, but retains some French expressions (e.g., \"C'est donc une mémoire à usage unique\"). The use of Spanish idioms is good in many places but not everywhere, leading to a slightly uneven adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The passage is missing a complete translation of the section starting with \"Vous pouvez prendre un modèle expert…\", and French fragments appear where Spanish should be. This omission removes significant content, reducing completeness.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the overall narrative and most technical content but is marred by missing sections, duplicated speaker tags, and untranslated French fragments. These issues significantly impact readability and completeness, though the general fluency and terminology usage remain reasonably good. With corrections, the translation could reach a higher quality level, but as it stands it falls short of a fully polished, complete rendition. Overall, the translation demonstrates a solid effort but needs refinement to meet high standards of accuracy and coherence for a Spanish‑speaking audience.  The final score reflects these strengths and weaknesses: 14 out of 20 points, indicating a satisfactory but improvable translation."
