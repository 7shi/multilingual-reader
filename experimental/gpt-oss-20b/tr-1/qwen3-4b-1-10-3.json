    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to understand; the structure follows the original dialogue and the ideas are conveyed. However, a few sentences have awkward word order or missing accents (e.g., *‘Hola y bienvenido en’* instead of *‘a’*), and some punctuation is inconsistent, which slightly hampers readability.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly in most places, but there are several non‑natural expressions and minor grammatical errors – such as *‘Vea mejor’* (better phrasing would be *‘Mira’* or *‘Observa’*), *‘El aprendizaje en contexto, es un aprendizaje superficial’* (the comma is misplaced), and *‘pronto para el próximo episodio’* (should be *‘hasta pronto’*). These issues reduce overall fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered (*preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*). The word *‘ancrage’* was left untranslated, and the explanation of *grounding* could have been clearer. Consistency is good, but the lack of translation for that term detracts from the score.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The content keeps the original intent and the dialogue flow is maintained. Cultural adaptation is generally adequate, though some phrases (e.g., *‘pronto para el próximo episodio’*) are not idiomatic. Overall, the adaptation is satisfactory.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information was omitted, and the dialogue remains complete. Minor punctuation omissions do not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation faithfully preserves the dialogue and key concepts of the original French script, with a high level of completeness. Readability and fluency are generally good, though some awkward phrasing and a few untranslated technical terms reduce the overall polish. With minor refinements—particularly in natural phrasing, punctuation, and consistent terminology—the translation would reach an even higher quality level. Nonetheless, it serves its purpose as a clear and coherent Spanish rendition of the original content. Overall, it is a solid, though not perfect, translation that could be refined for maximum naturalness and precision. The final score reflects an average performance across all criteria, indicating that the translation is competent but still has room for improvement in fluency and terminology consistency. Overall, a 15/20 rating is appropriate for this version of the translation. The main areas for improvement are polishing natural language usage, fixing minor grammatical slips, and translating all technical terms consistently. Once those adjustments are made, the translation would be highly effective for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
