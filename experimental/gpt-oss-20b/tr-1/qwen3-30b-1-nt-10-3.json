  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is quite readable: the dialogue flows naturally and the analogies (graduate, bicycle, consultant) help explain complex concepts. Sentence structure is mostly clear, though some phrases feel slightly mechanical (e.g., *‘la IA no está ‘olvidado’ en el sentido humano’*). Overall, readers can understand the content without difficulty. Score: 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds generally smooth for native speakers, but a few constructions are awkward or slightly incorrect, such as *‘la IA no está ‘olvidado’* (should be *‘olvidado’* or *‘olvidado*’), and the use of *‘se puede tener’* instead of *‘podemos’* in some places. Word choices like *‘ajuste fino’* for *‘fine‑tuning’* are acceptable but could be harmonised. Overall fluency is good but not perfect. Score: 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *anclaje*. The translation consistently uses the chosen Spanish equivalents, and the term *ICL* is clearly explained. Minor inconsistencies (e.g., *‘ajuste fino’* appears once as *‘ajuste fino’* and elsewhere as *‘fine‑tuning’*) are negligible. Score: 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the friendly, conversational tone and the cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish audience. However, some expressions are translated literally (e.g., *‘se puede tener una conversación larga y detallada’* could be *‘podemos mantener una conversación larga y detallada’*). The use of French quotation marks is acceptable but not strictly Spanish typographic norm. Overall adaptation is adequate. Score: 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines from the original French transcript are present, and no significant content is omitted. The translation retains the structure and pacing of the conversation. Minor variations in wording do not affect meaning. Score: 19/20.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the original content faithfully and is largely clear and comprehensible. Minor fluency issues and some literal phrasing reduce the naturalness slightly, but terminology is handled well and the information is complete. With a few polishing touches, this would be a high‑quality translation suitable for native Spanish‑speaking audiences watching the podcast or reading the transcript. Overall, it demonstrates a solid grasp of both the technical material and the conversational style of the source text. The translation would benefit most from refining a few awkward constructions and ensuring consistent use of borrowed terms (e.g., *‘ajuste fino’*). Overall, it is a commendable effort with room for minor improvement. Total score: 85/100."
