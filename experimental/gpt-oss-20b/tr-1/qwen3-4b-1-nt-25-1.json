  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is mostly understandable to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Sentences follow a logical order, and complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) are explained in a way that is clear. However, some phrases feel slightly clunky (“para que le den una cultura general”) and gender‑agreement errors (“bienvenido” instead of “bienvenidos”) slightly affect ease of reading. Overall, readability is good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains a few grammatical slips and unnatural word choices that disrupt the flow for native speakers – e.g., “se envía una IA”, “le presentas una cantidad mucho menor de texto”. While the overall meaning is preserved, these issues reduce the naturalness of the text. The use of the formal “usted” in some places and informal “tú” in others also makes the register inconsistent. A smoother rewrite would improve fluency. Therefore, the score is moderate.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled appropriately: “preentrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning” → “afinado”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto” (ICL). The terminology is consistent throughout and matches common Spanish parlance in the AI field. Explanations for complex concepts are preserved. The only minor issue is the occasional literal translation (“aprender el francés a una velocidad increíble”) that could be phrased more idiomatically. Nevertheless, the terminology score is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely preserves the original intent and structure. However, some expressions are not fully adapted to Spanish cultural norms – for instance, the greeting “Hola y bienvenido en « Tech Éclair »” should be “Hola y bienvenidos a « Tech Éclair »”. The translator also keeps some English‑style phrasing (“en context learning”) instead of more common Spanish equivalents. These adaptations are minor, so the overall score is decent but not perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original is present; no sections were omitted, and the dialogue flow is maintained. The translation adds no extraneous content and keeps the text concise. Therefore, it is complete.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material and preserves most of its technical content. Readability and terminology are strong, though some phrasing and gender agreement errors detract from the overall fluency. The translation conveys the original intent but could benefit from a more careful polish to achieve naturalness and consistency in register."
