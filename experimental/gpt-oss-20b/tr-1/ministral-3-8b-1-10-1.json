  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains numerous incomplete sentences, placeholders like \"previous\" and \"Luc: memory\", and several untranslated French fragments. These gaps make the text difficult to follow and obscure the logical flow. While some Spanish sentences are understandable, the overall structure is fragmented, which hinders readability for a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many phrases sound awkward or are outright incomplete. For instance, \"Camille: previous\" and \"Luc: memory\" are not proper Spanish expressions. The translated text mixes Spanish with residual English and French words, disrupting naturalness. Vocabulary is mostly correct where present, but overall fluency suffers due to missing or garbled passages.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The translator correctly renders key technical terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje\". However, the inconsistent handling of some terms (e.g., leaving \"grounding\" untranslated in one spot) and the omission of explanatory paraphrases in a few places reduce consistency. The core terminology is mostly accurate but not uniformly applied.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation occasionally adapts cultural references appropriately, but the presence of incomplete dialogue and untranslated fragments indicates a failure to fully convey the original intent. There is no significant effort to adjust expressions for a Spanish-speaking audience beyond basic literal translation, and the overall adaptation is weak due to missing content.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are omitted or replaced with placeholders, resulting in significant information loss. The translator does not provide necessary supplements or clarifications to compensate for these gaps. The final product is far from a complete, coherent translation of the source material.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is incomplete and contains many errors, placeholders, and untranslated fragments. While some technical terminology is handled correctly, the overall readability, fluency, and contextual adaptation are severely compromised. A comprehensive revision is needed to restore the full meaning, correct grammar, and ensure consistency throughout the dialogue. The current version would not serve as a reliable reference for Spanish-speaking audiences or for anyone seeking to understand the original content accurately. "
