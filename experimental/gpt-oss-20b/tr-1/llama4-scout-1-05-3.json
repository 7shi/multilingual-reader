  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally follows a clear line‑by‑line structure, so a native Spanish reader can follow the overall flow. However, some sentences are awkward or fragmented, especially where French fragments remain or where the syntax is forced (e.g., \"Quand vous ouvrez une nouvelle fenêtre…\" appears in the middle of a Spanish paragraph). The use of conversational language is mostly preserved, but a few technical concepts are not fully clarified (e.g., the brief explanation of ICL). Overall, readability is acceptable but not fluent.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains noticeable grammatical and lexical errors: the mixing of French and Spanish, the literal transposition of idioms (\"faire un cram\" → \"hacer un cram\"), and some unnatural phrasing (e.g., \"una chuleta\" is colloquial but out of context). The punctuation is inconsistent, and the flow suffers from abrupt language switches. Consequently, the translation feels choppy and unnatural for a native speaker.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms such as \"pré‑entraînement\", \"affinage\", \"fine‑tuning\" and \"ICL\" are generally translated correctly, but inconsistently (sometimes left in French, sometimes rendered as \"afinamiento\" or \"fine‑tuning\"). Technical terminology related to machine learning is sometimes omitted or misrepresented (e.g., the explanation of memory windows). The translation could benefit from a consistent terminology list and clearer definitions for non‑technical listeners.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent of the podcast – explaining AI training processes – is maintained, but cultural nuances are not fully addressed. For instance, the phrase \"un consultant brillant\" is literal and does not resonate with a Spanish-speaking audience. Additionally, the inserted French fragments undermine the cultural adaptation. The translation would be stronger with more idiomatic Spanish and a better balance between literal and contextual adaptation.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is present, but some portions are missing or garbled: the explanation of grounding, the brief comment on memory features, and the final conclusion are partially translated or left in French. Redundancies appear where explanations are repeated, and some necessary clarifications are absent. The translation could be more concise and complete by removing the French intrusions and ensuring all segments are fully rendered.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation displays a solid structural foundation but suffers from frequent language mixing, inconsistent terminology, and awkward phrasing that compromise fluency and readability. While the core concepts are generally preserved, the translation would benefit from a thorough cleanup of French fragments, a consistent technical glossary, and more idiomatic Spanish phrasing to achieve a natural and professional tone suitable for podcast listeners. The overall quality is average, requiring significant revision to reach a professional standard for a Spanish‑speaking audience, particularly for technical content in a conversational format. The estimated overall score is 10 out of 20, reflecting the need for substantial improvement in fluency, terminology consistency, and contextual adaptation, while acknowledging the adequate conveyance of the main ideas and structure of the source text."
