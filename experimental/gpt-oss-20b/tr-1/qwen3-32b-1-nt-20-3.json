  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, but several sentences are incomplete or missing key words (e.g., \"Luc: llevar\"), and some phrasing is awkward. The overall flow is somewhat disrupted, which makes it harder for a reader to follow the entire dialogue smoothly.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains multiple grammatical errors (e.g., \"informaciones\" instead of \"información\", missing articles, and improper verb forms) that make the text feel stilted. Some expressions are literal and not idiomatic, such as \"se olvida de todo\". These issues reduce the naturalness of the text.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, ventana de contexto) are generally preserved and understood. However, consistency suffers in a few places where a term is slightly misspelled or misused. Overall, the terminology is mostly correct.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The core intent of the dialogue is preserved, but some cultural or stylistic adjustments are missing. The translation stays close to the original structure, which is fine for a technical podcast, yet the occasional incomplete sentences weaken the adaptation.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several parts of the dialogue are truncated or contain stray fragments (e.g., \"Luc: llevar\"), resulting in omitted information. The overall meaning is mostly present but some nuances are lost, and redundancy from the original is not adequately handled.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the subject matter and retains most technical terms, but it suffers from grammatical inaccuracies, incomplete sentences, and occasional mistranslations. The result is a text that is understandable but not polished or fully faithful to the source. It would benefit from a thorough proof‑reading and consistency check."
