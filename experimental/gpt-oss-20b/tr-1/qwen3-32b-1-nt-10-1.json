  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable, but several duplicated or incomplete lines (e.g. “Camille: we”, “Luc: Luc:”, “Luc: – de l’ICL”) interrupt the flow and create confusion. The sentence structure is mostly logical, yet these errors lower overall comprehensibility.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many passages read naturally, but some phrases are awkward or inappropriate for a native Spanish speaker. For instance, “Usted lo ha entendido todo” uses a formal pronoun unnecessarily, and the abrupt truncation “– de l’ICL” makes the text feel disjointed. Overall, the translation feels slightly mechanical in places.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, in‑context learning (ICL), anclaje, memoria. Minor inconsistencies (e.g., keeping “ICL” in English, capitalizing “Memoria” arbitrarily) do not impede understanding, so the terminology is largely appropriate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The informal, conversational tone of a podcast is preserved, and cultural references are adequately adapted (e.g., opening with “Hola”). However, the formal “Usted” in the middle of a casual dialogue and the accidental insertion of “we” reduce the naturalness of the adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most content is retained, but some lines are missing or incomplete, notably the duplicated “Luc: Luc:” line and the truncated “– de l’ICL”. These omissions slightly diminish the completeness of the translation, though the core information remains intact.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material and maintains the informal podcast style, but is marred by a few typographical errors, awkward phrasing, and minor omissions that reduce clarity and flow. It would benefit from a careful proofreading and a more consistent use of pronouns and punctuation to reach higher quality levels. Overall, it is a good effort but still has room for improvement in fluency and completeness."
