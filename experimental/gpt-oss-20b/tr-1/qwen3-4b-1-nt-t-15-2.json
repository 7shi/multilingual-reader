  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow, but a few awkward phrasings and missing articles (e.g., “bienvenido en” instead of “bienvenidos a”) slightly hinder smooth comprehension. Overall, readers can grasp the main ideas without major confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions feel literal or grammatically off: “para darles una cultura general”, “El aprendizaje en contexto, es el bacheo”, “en el fondo” instead of “en segundo plano”, and inconsistent use of gender. These quirks break the natural flow for native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, and *anclaje* are correctly rendered and consistently used. The only slip is the informal “bacheo”, which departs from the usual terminology for in‑context learning. Overall, terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects Spanish idioms and punctuation, but some cultural nuances could be improved (e.g., greeting phrasing and the use of “IA” in plural form). The intent and purpose are preserved, yet the adaptation would benefit from smoother, culturally resonant wording.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential points from the original are present, and no critical details are omitted. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., “La IA no se afinan” vs. “La IA no es constantemente afinada”) do not affect meaning. The translation remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the core concepts and overall narrative of the original French text. While readability and terminology are solid, fluency suffers from several literal and grammatical quirks that detract from a native‑speaker experience. With some refinement in phrasing and cultural adaptation, the translation could reach a higher level of naturalness and polish. Overall, it is competent but leaves room for improvement in fluidity and stylistic nuance. The average score reflects this balanced assessment: 16/20, indicating a good but not perfect translation. If you wish, I can suggest specific edits to address the highlighted issues."
