  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable for a native audience, but several sentences are fragmented or missing words (e.g., \"Camille: , que algunas IA comienzan a integrar?\"), which interrupts the flow. Punctuation and some accents are also missing, making it harder to follow. The overall structure follows the original dialogue, but the occasional gaps lower overall clarity.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the translation uses many appropriate Spanish expressions, several phrases feel unnatural or incorrectly formed. Words like \"sosténance\" and \"bachoter\" are not standard Spanish; the correct terms would be \"apoyo\" and \"bachear\". Punctuation errors and the broken sentence mentioned above also detract from the natural flow. The text would read more smoothly with these corrections.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly translated: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine-tuning\" → \"afinamiento\", \"transfer learning\" → \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"In‑Context Learning\" → \"aprendizaje en contexto\". However, \"ancrage\" was rendered as \"sosténance\", a non‑existent Spanish word, and the explanation of this concept is missing. Consistency is good elsewhere, but the terminology score is affected by this mistake.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator has generally kept the conversational tone and cultural references suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor issues arise where the translator tries to adapt phrases (e.g., \"en el sentido humano\") but ends up with slightly awkward wording. Overall, the adaptation is acceptable but could be refined for a more natural cultural resonance.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All main ideas from the original are present, but a few sentences are incomplete or broken, notably the one that starts with a comma. No substantial content is omitted, yet the missing pieces reduce the completeness slightly. No excessive redundancy is introduced, and the translation remains concise.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core ideas of the original French script and is mostly intelligible for a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, several linguistic and terminological inaccuracies, punctuation errors, and fragmented sentences hinder its overall quality. With targeted revisions—correcting non‑existent terms, fixing broken sentences, and polishing the flow—the translation could reach a high standard of clarity, fluency, and professional tone. The current version earns a moderate score, reflecting solid groundwork but room for improvement in accuracy and polish. Overall score: 62/100."
