  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is mostly understandable, but the presence of French fragments (e.g. “C’est là qu’intervient le concept d’« ancrage »”) interrupts the flow and can confuse native readers. Sentence structures are generally logical, yet some phrases (e.g. “el enunciado”) feel awkward. A score of 14/20 reflects the decent overall comprehensibility with room for improvement.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several awkward or unidiomatic constructions and retains French wording that disrupts the natural rhythm of Spanish. While most vocabulary is correct, expressions such as “el sistema busca rápidamente en tus antiguos intercambios” would be better rendered as “el sistema busca rápidamente en tus conversaciones anteriores”. These issues lower the fluency to 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled accurately: “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “memoria a corto plazo”, etc., are used consistently and are appropriate for the target audience. Minor inconsistencies exist (e.g., “grounding” left in English without adaptation). Overall, strong terminology use merits 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator often kept French phrases verbatim, which does not adapt the text to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Cultural references are minimal, but the lack of full localization reduces contextual adaptation to 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Key portions of the original French script were not translated (the “ancrage” paragraph remained in French), and some details were rephrased rather than faithfully reproduced. The core meaning is preserved, but omissions and minor alterations lower completeness to 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the overall narrative and most technical content, but it is hindered by the retention of French fragments, occasional awkward phrasing, and a few omissions. While readable and technically accurate in many respects, the text would benefit from a thorough localization effort to ensure naturalness and full fidelity to the source material. The overall quality is moderate, with clear potential for improvement in consistency and cultural adaptation. The total score averages 13/20, indicating a solid but incomplete effort that should be revised before publication or broadcast to a Spanish‑speaking audience. The primary goal should be to replace all non‑Spanish segments and refine idiomatic expressions for smoother, more engaging delivery. The translation would be acceptable for a general audience with some tolerance for minor linguistic quirks, but it falls short of professional broadcast standards that require full localization and polish. The evaluation thus reflects a balanced assessment of strengths and weaknesses across the key criteria. The average score is 13/20, with individual criteria ranging from 12 to 15 points, illustrating the uneven performance across aspects of translation quality. The final recommendation is to review the text thoroughly, especially for French remnants, to achieve a more polished and fully adapted version suitable for native Spanish speakers."
