  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is understandable in parts but is disrupted by several untranslated or malformed fragments (e.g., \"Camille: suelen\"), abrupt omissions, and occasional syntax errors. These issues make the flow difficult for a native reader to follow, lowering overall readability to 10/20.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences are grammatically correct and use appropriate vocabulary. However, there are frequent unnatural phrasings and missing accents (e.g., \"¿Es ahí donde aparece el aprendizaje por transferencia?\" could be smoother). The presence of truncated lines and inconsistent punctuation further reduces fluency, resulting in a score of 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms such as \"pre-entraînement\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"In‑Context Learning\" and \"grounding\" are mostly translated correctly (pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje). Some alternatives (e.g., \"ajuste fino\" instead of \"afinamiento\") could improve precision, and a few technical terms (like \"mémoire\") are omitted. Overall terminology handling earns 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator attempts to localize expressions (e.g., replacing French idioms with Spanish equivalents), but many contextual nuances are lost due to omitted dialogue and incomplete sentences. Cultural adaptation is minimal, so the score is 9/20.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several lines from the original dialogue are missing or truncated (e.g., \"Camille: suelen\", gaps after certain exchanges). This omission removes essential information and diminishes coherence. The translation fails to convey the full content, earning 7/20.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation displays a basic grasp of the source material but is marred by numerous omissions, grammatical mistakes, and awkward phrasing. While the core technical concepts are largely intact, the lack of completeness and the fragmented delivery limit its usefulness for listeners seeking a faithful rendition of the original episode. The overall quality is mediocre, and significant revision is recommended to achieve a smooth, accurate, and comprehensive translation."
