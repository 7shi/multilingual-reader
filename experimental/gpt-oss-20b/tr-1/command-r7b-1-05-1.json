    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is understandable at a basic level, but numerous grammatical mistakes, missing articles, and broken sentence structures hinder smooth reading. The presence of exclamation marks in places where they are not appropriate and inconsistent use of the definite article before \"IA\" (\"El IA\" instead of \"La IA\") create confusion for native Spanish speakers. Consequently, while the overall message is discernible, the reader may need to read twice to fully grasp some sections.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation frequently uses unnatural phrasing and awkward punctuation. Examples include \"¡Entiende todo. Es como contratar...\", which lacks the expected pronoun and has a misplaced exclamation mark. Word choice is often literal and does not flow naturally for a Spanish audience. These issues lower the text's overall fluency, though the general meaning remains intact.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste (fine‑tuning)\", and \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are mostly preserved. However, there are serious errors where the wrong term is used (e.g., \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachillerato\" to describe fine‑tuning) and missing articles before \"IA\". Consistency and precision are compromised in a few places, which affects terminology reliability.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to adapt the conversation to a Spanish‑speaking audience, but several culturally inappropriate expressions appear, such as the improper use of exclamation marks and the literal rendering of certain idiomatic French expressions. Additionally, some phrases feel too formal or too literal for everyday Spanish usage. Therefore, while the overall intent is preserved, the adaptation quality is mediocre.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all content from the original is present; the dialogue structure remains intact. Nevertheless, the mis‑translation of key concepts (e.g., the confusion between fine‑tuning and ICL) distorts important information. No major sections are omitted, but the errors reduce the accuracy of the conveyed details.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the gist of the original conversation but is marred by frequent grammatical mistakes, awkward phrasing, and occasional terminology errors that affect clarity and accuracy. While the core ideas are retained, a native speaker would find the text somewhat disorienting and would need to reread parts to fully understand the content. Improvements in proofreading, consistency of terminology, and natural phrasing would raise the overall quality substantially. The translation would benefit from a thorough copy‑editing review to correct these issues and to ensure that technical terms are used correctly throughout the dialogue. Overall, the work is passable but requires significant refinement to reach a professional standard for Spanish‑speaking audiences."
