    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, with most sentences following a logical order that mirrors the original French script. However, some grammatical errors (e.g., missing accents, incorrect prepositions) and awkward phrasing—such as “la IA es como un recién licenciado” and “la IA se acuerda”—slightly hinder smooth reading. Nonetheless, the overall sense of the dialogue is clear to a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the text captures the conversational tone of a podcast, there are several unnatural constructions: the use of \"Simply\" instead of \"simplemente\", incorrect verb forms like \"Cuando usted afinan\", and inconsistent use of articles (e.g., \"en\" instead of \"a\" in the greeting). These issues reduce the naturalness of the translation and could feel jarring to native listeners. The overall flow is acceptable but not entirely smooth.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"fine-tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly translated and consistently used. Minor issues include the word \"Afinado\" instead of the more common \"afinamiento\", but this does not substantially affect comprehension for the target audience. The terminology remains clear and appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely preserves the original intent and style, using culturally relevant expressions like \"consultor brillante\". Some adaptation shortcomings appear in prepositional errors (“en” vs. “a”) and awkward phrasing that could be polished for a Spanish audience. Overall, the cultural adaptation is adequate but could be refined for better resonance.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French script are present in the Spanish version. The dialogue covers pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, context window, in‑context learning, memory features, and the consultant vs. permanent expert analogy. No substantive content is omitted, and the information remains concise, though a few redundant phrases appear due to repetition in the source text.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and largely faithful to the source, capturing both technical explanations and the conversational tone of a podcast. It contains some grammatical and stylistic errors that detract from naturalness, and a few terms could be rendered more idiomatically. Despite these issues, the translation conveys the intended message and technical concepts effectively for a Spanish‑speaking audience, though a final polish would improve fluency and readability.\n\nOverall score: 16/20 (average of the five criteria)."
