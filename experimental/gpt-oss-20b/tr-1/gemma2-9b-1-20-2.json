    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely understandable, but several sentences are awkwardly constructed and some phrases are translated literally from French (e.g., “C'est là qu'intervient le concept de …”) which disrupts the flow for Spanish‑speaking listeners. There are also minor typographical issues (“Ustedes han comprendido todo”) that hinder comprehension. Overall, readability is acceptable but not flawless.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation often sounds stilted, partly due to the intermingling of French/English words (“grounding”), improper pronoun usage (“Ustedes”), and literal translations (“afianzamiento” for fine‑tuning). Sentence structure is generally correct, but the naturalness is compromised by these elements. Fluency is moderate.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, and *ventana de contexto* are correctly rendered. However, “afianzamiento” is an awkward choice for fine‑tuning and the retention of the English term *grounding* without adaptation slightly reduces clarity. Terminology is largely accurate but could be more consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely keeps the original meaning, but some culturally inappropriate choices appear: the use of “Ustedes” (plural) in a context that originally used the singular, and the direct carryover of French phrasing. These choices weaken the adaptation to a Spanish audience. Contextual adaptation is acceptable but not optimal.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present; no essential information is omitted. Some repetition is present (e.g., both *ajuste fino* and *afianzamiento* for the same concept), but this does not significantly diminish clarity. The translation remains comprehensive.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "La traducción al español es comprensible y cubre la mayoría de los puntos técnicos, pero presenta varios problemas de fluidez y adaptación cultural. La mezcla de idiomas y algunas elecciones de vocabulario poco naturales dificultan la lectura. Con ajustes, el texto podría lograr un nivel de calidad superior. Overall, it is a decent but not excellent translation, scoring around 14 out of 20 points.  The average of the five criteria is 14.4/20, which is rounded to 14/20 for the overall score.  The translation would benefit from a more consistent terminology and a clearer adaptation to Spanish linguistic conventions, especially regarding pronoun usage and the removal of French fragments that interrupt the natural flow of the text.  This would enhance both readability and fluency for Spanish‑speaking audiences."
