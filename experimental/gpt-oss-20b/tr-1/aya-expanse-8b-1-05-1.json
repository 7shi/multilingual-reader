  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely comprehensible and follows a logical sentence structure.  Some long sentences and a few minor grammatical slips (e.g., “las información”) slightly hinder readability, but overall the flow is clear for native listeners.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a handful of awkward expressions such as “aprendizaje contextual” used inconsistently with “aprendizaje en contexto”, and the use of “astuta” where “ingeniosa” would feel more idiomatic.  The grammar is generally correct but not entirely smooth.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately rendered (preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL).  The occasional switch to “aprendizaje contextual” instead of “aprendizaje en contexto” is a minor inconsistency, but overall terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone, and adapts expressions to a Spanish-speaking audience.  Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is straightforward, though a few literal phrasings could be more idiomatic.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present; no significant omissions.  The translator adds a few clarifying details that aid understanding but does not overly repeat or inflate the content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and conveys the essential meaning of the original French dialogue.  It is generally readable and technically accurate, though a few grammatical tweaks and more idiomatic phrasing would elevate the naturalness of the text.  For a polished final version, focus on correcting minor word‑choice errors and ensuring consistent use of the terminology throughout the episode script."
