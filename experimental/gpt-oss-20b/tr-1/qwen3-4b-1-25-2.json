    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the original dialogue structure. However, grammatical slips such as \"la IA no se afinan\" (subject‑verb disagreement) and slightly awkward phrasing (e.g., \"la IA se envía a la escuela\") interrupt the flow. Nonetheless, a native reader can grasp the meaning without major confusion. 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural expressions and grammatical errors: \"la IA no se afinan\" (should be *se afina*), \"le dimos solo una anticipe\" (incorrect word choice), and plural‑singular mismatches like \"las informaciones\". These issues make the text feel robotic rather than conversational. 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly preserved: *pre-entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *anclaje*. Consistency is good, but some terms are slightly off, e.g., \"anticipe\" instead of a proper Spanish equivalent for *hint* or *prompt*. Overall, terminology is handled adequately. 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the informal, dialogue‑style tone and uses culturally relevant greetings. Minor issues: \"Hola y bienvenido\" instead of the plural greeting and a few phrases that sound more literal than natural. Still, the intent and cultural context are preserved. 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points of the original are present; no essential content is omitted. Minor semantic drift occurs in the phrase about memory (“le dimos solo una anticipe”), but overall the information remains intact. 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the gist of the original French dialogue and preserves the conversational structure. Nevertheless, grammatical inaccuracies and occasional awkward word choices detract from the naturalness and clarity expected of a polished Spanish text. A revision focusing on subject‑verb agreement, appropriate vocabulary, and smoother phrasing would significantly improve the quality, especially for a native‑speaking audience. The translation is functional but needs editing to reach a professional standard. 70/100."
