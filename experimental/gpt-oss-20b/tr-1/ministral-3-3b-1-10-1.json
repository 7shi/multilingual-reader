  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text contains numerous incomplete sentences, abrupt jumps, and remnants of French wording (e.g., “pre-entrenamiento”, “afinado”, “grounding”). These gaps disrupt the flow and make it hard for a Spanish‑speaking listener or reader to follow the conversation. The overall logical structure is fragmented, reducing comprehensibility to a 6/20.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation frequently uses literal, awkward phrasing and occasionally leaves French terms untranslated. The syntax often feels disjointed, with many lines cut off mid‑thought, making the passage sound unnatural and hard to parse for native Spanish speakers. This earns a 5/20.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as *pré‑entraînement*, *fine‑tuning*, *in‑context learning* are sometimes translated correctly (e.g., *pre‑entrenamiento*, *afinado*, *aprendizaje en contexto*), but many others are either missing or incorrectly rendered. Inconsistent use of terminology and occasional literal mistranslations (e.g., *grounding* as *grounding*) lower the score to 7/20.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue’s intent—to explain AI training concepts conversationally—is only partially preserved. Cultural references and idiomatic explanations suitable for a Spanish audience are scarce, and many parts remain in French or are omitted. This yields a 6/20.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original script are omitted or garbled (e.g., missing speaker turns, broken sentences). Consequently, essential explanations about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are not fully conveyed, resulting in a 4/20.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is significantly incomplete and contains numerous errors that compromise readability, fluency, and accuracy. It requires substantial revision to become a coherent, faithful Spanish rendition of the original French podcast script. The current version is unsuitable for listeners or readers seeking a clear explanation of AI training concepts in Spanish. The overall quality reflects a translation that is largely unfinished and inconsistent with the original content and intent, scoring around 6/20 on average across the evaluated criteria. The work should be redone with careful attention to continuity, terminology consistency, and contextual adaptation to achieve a reliable and natural Spanish version."
