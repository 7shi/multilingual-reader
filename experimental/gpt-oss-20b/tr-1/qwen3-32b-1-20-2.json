    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely understandable to a Spanish‑speaking audience. The narrative flow follows the original dialogue structure and the main ideas are conveyed. However, a few sentences are quite long and could benefit from slight re‑phrasing to improve clarity (e.g., \"La IA no se afinan constantemente por sus conversaciones\" – the passive construction feels clunky). Overall, readers can follow the content without major confusion.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text generally reads smoothly, but several expressions feel awkward or non‑native: \"tienes la razón\" is correct, yet \"se le proporcionó una cheat sheet\" uses the English slang 'cheat sheet' instead of a Spanish equivalent. Verb agreement errors such as \"La IA no se afinan\" and the missing accent in \"entrenamiento\" affect fluency. Despite these issues, the overall flow is acceptable for native speakers.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly well translated: \"entrenamiento previo\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\". The term \"grounding\" is rendered as \"anclaje\", which is appropriate. Minor inconsistencies (e.g., use of \"cheat sheet\" instead of \"pauta\" or \"chequeo\") are present but do not detract significantly from comprehension. Consistency is generally maintained across the text.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the conversational tone of a podcast and adapts expressions to Spanish. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is limited. However, the use of English slang such as \"cheat sheet\" indicates a missed opportunity for full cultural adaptation. The overall intent and purpose are preserved, though some expressions could be further localized.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French script are present in the Spanish translation. The script retains the same dialogue exchanges, explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, and the concept of memory. No essential information is omitted, though some redundancy is slightly reduced in the translation. Minor grammatical slips do not affect the completeness of the content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the core meaning and dialogue structure of the French original and is largely understandable to Spanish readers. However, there are noticeable issues with fluency—particularly the use of anglicisms, awkward phrasing, and some verb agreement errors—that slightly diminish the naturalness of the text. Technical terminology is handled appropriately, and the translation retains the narrative intent. With minor refinements in phrasing and consistency, the translation would achieve higher overall quality. Overall, it is a competent translation but could benefit from polishing to reach a native‑speaker level of fluency and precision. The average score reflects a solid but not perfect effort, highlighting areas for improvement in linguistic naturalness and cultural adaptation while maintaining technical accuracy and completeness. The text would serve well for an informal podcast transcript but would need adjustments for formal publication or use by a broader audience."
