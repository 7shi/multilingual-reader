  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is easily comprehensible for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Sentence structure follows natural patterns, and the use of everyday expressions (e.g., *recientemente egresado*, *ventana de contexto*) keeps the dialogue engaging. Minor awkwardness appears in a couple of phrases (e.g., *Eso es todo a la verdad*), but overall the flow remains clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation reads smoothly. The vocabulary is contemporary and appropriate for a podcast audience. There are a few slightly unnatural wordings: *Eso es todo a la verdad* and the isolated *Lee* (third‑person) could be smoothed out. However, these do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *In‑Context Learning*. The translation maintains the original meaning without over‑simplifying, and it uses terms that are widely understood by Spanish‑speaking tech listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references well, using idiomatic Spanish where appropriate. The concept of a *consultor brillante* aligns with common Spanish usage. The adaptation is faithful to the original intent and tone, making it resonate with the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All points from the original French text are present. No substantive omissions or distortions occur. Minor deviations in phrasing (e.g., *Eso es todo a la verdad*) do not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation demonstrates a high level of fidelity and readability, with only marginal areas for refinement. It effectively preserves the technical content, natural flow, and cultural relevance of the original podcast dialogue, making it well suited for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Minor stylistic tweaks could elevate the fluency further, but overall the translation is excellent and serves its intended purpose."
