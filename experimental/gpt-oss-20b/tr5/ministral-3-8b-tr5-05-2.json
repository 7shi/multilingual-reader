  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are short and most complex ideas are explained in plain language. Minor issues arise with occasional literal word‑order changes that slightly obscure meaning, but overall a native reader can grasp the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The prose is mostly smooth, though a few phrases feel slightly literal or awkward (e.g., \"El refinado busca crear una habilidad permanente\" instead of \"El afinado…\"). Some gender/number mismatches (“vuestras” vs. “vosotros”) also surface. These quirks reduce the natural flow, but do not severely impede comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *afinación*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ICL*, *anclaje* and *memoria a corto plazo* are correctly rendered and consistently used. However, the switch between *afinado* and *refinado* can cause slight confusion, and the word *grounding* is translated as *anclaje* without a brief definition.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the intent and tone of the original podcast script. Cultural adaptation is adequate: greetings, informal tone, and references to everyday scenarios (consultant analogy, bicycle example) fit a Spanish-speaking audience. No major contextual errors were detected.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory, and the consultant vs. permanent‑expert analogy. No significant omissions were found, and the summary is concise.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version faithfully conveys the original content and is largely comprehensible. Minor fluency issues and occasional terminology inconsistencies slightly detract from the overall polish, but the translation remains useful for native listeners."
