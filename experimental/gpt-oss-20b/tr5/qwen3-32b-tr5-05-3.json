  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally easy to read; sentences flow logically and complex concepts are explained in a way that Spanish readers can follow. Minor issues such as occasional repetition of “ajuste fino” and a few misplaced commas slightly reduce clarity, but overall the text remains comprehensible.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text mostly sounds natural to a native Spanish speaker, but there are a few awkward expressions and small grammatical inconsistencies (e.g., the use of “AEC” instead of the accepted abbreviation “ICL”, and the repetition of “ajuste fino”). Punctuation could be improved in a few places. These issues prevent it from being fully smooth.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\", and \"Memoria\" are appropriate. The abbreviation \"AEC\" is a mistake; the accepted term is \"ICL\". Aside from that, terminology is consistent and well‑chosen.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French idioms to Spanish equivalents and preserves the conversational tone. Some cultural nuances, such as the phrase “consultor temporal vs. experto permanente”, fit the target audience. However, the repeated mis‑abbreviation of ICL slightly diminishes the adaptation quality.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original is present. The dialogue structure is preserved, and key explanations are not omitted. Minor details such as the exact wording of prompts are left in English, but this does not hinder understanding.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid overall, conveying the meaning, tone, and technical content of the original French text. While a few minor errors—particularly with terminology abbreviations and occasional repetition—slightly detract from perfect fluency, the translation remains clear, accurate, and well‑adapted to a Spanish‑speaking audience."
