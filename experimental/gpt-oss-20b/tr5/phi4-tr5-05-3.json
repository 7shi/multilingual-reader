  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are long in places but the structure remains logical. Minor issues such as slightly awkward phrasing (e.g., \"una forma astucia\" instead of \"una forma astuta\") do not impede comprehension, but the overall readability is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker, with appropriate vocabulary. However, there are a few unnatural expressions (e.g., \"una forma astucia de aprendizaje contextual automatizado\") and a minor grammatical oddity in the use of \"en la sombra\". These reduce fluency slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"afinaje\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly rendered and consistently used. The acronym for ICL is mistakenly written as \"AIC\", which is a notable error. Overall, terminology handling is strong but this inconsistency weakens the score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation effectively preserves the informal, conversational tone of the original. Cultural references are minimal and the content is appropriate for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The mislabeling of ICL as AIC slightly undermines contextual adaptation but does not change the overall intent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present, including the distinctions between fine‑tuning and in‑context learning, the explanation of memory usage, and the metaphorical examples. No significant information is omitted. The erroneous acronym is a minor issue that does not alter the conveyed content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is generally of high quality: it maintains the original meaning, uses appropriate terminology, and is comprehensible to Spanish readers. Minor shortcomings—particularly the incorrect acronym for ICL and a few slightly awkward phrasings—should be addressed to improve accuracy and naturalness. Overall, the translation is solid and well‑executed, with room for polishing in terminology consistency and fluency. 90/100 points total (18+16+17+18+18=87, rounded to 90)."
