  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The sentence is concise and uses straightforward syntax that Spanish speakers can understand without difficulty. The structure follows a natural order, and there are no complex clauses that could confuse the reader. The only minor point is the omission of the conjunction ‘et’ from the original, but this does not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for a native speaker. The phrase ‘habernos escuchado’ is perfectly acceptable, though ‘escucharnos’ would be slightly more common. Overall, the style is conversational yet polite, matching the podcast’s tone.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "There are no technical terms to translate; the only terminology that matters is the proper name ‘Tech Éclair’, which is retained unchanged. The translation correctly uses the standard Spanish equivalents for the French expressions.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the intended polite gratitude and the upbeat anticipation of the next episode. The use of the exclamation marks fits the Spanish punctuation norms for emphasis in informal contexts, and the phrase ‘para el próximo episodio’ accurately conveys the meaning of ‘pour le prochain épisode’. Minor stylistic tweaks could be made, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original sentence is present: thanks for listening, a friendly farewell, and mention of the next episode of the podcast. No information is omitted or misrepresented. The translation is concise and clear.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is highly accurate, readable, and fluent. It captures the spirit of the original French line with only negligible stylistic differences. The only small improvement could be using ‘escucharnos’ instead of ‘habernos escuchado’, but this does not materially affect quality. Overall, it is an excellent translation for the intended audience and context. The translation successfully conveys gratitude and anticipation for the next episode in a natural Spanish style, making it appropriate for a tech podcast audience. The slight deviation in word choice does not impact comprehension or tone significantly, and the translation meets all evaluation criteria effectively. An overall score of 19/20 reflects its near‑perfect quality while acknowledging a minor stylistic point that could be refined for even greater naturalness in everyday Spanish usage. The translator has succeeded in producing a clear, fluent, and contextually appropriate version of the original French sentence, suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners of the podcast. No significant errors or omissions are present, and the content is fully aligned with the original intent and register."
