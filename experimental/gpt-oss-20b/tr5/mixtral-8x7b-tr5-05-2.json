  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is a disjointed compilation of multiple drafts, literal word‑for‑word translations, and explanatory notes inserted as if they were part of the dialogue. The narrative flow is broken, many sentences are incomplete, and the script jumps between speakers and meta‑commentary. As a result, a reader would struggle to follow the conversation and to grasp the main ideas of the original French text. The readability score is therefore very low.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains numerous unnatural constructions (e.g., \"Hoy, soy Luc—revelaré...\"), literal translations that ignore idiomatic Spanish, and frequent interjections of translation commentary. The overall flow is not smooth, and the language feels mechanical rather than conversational. Consequently, the fluency score is low.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pré‑entraînement\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"learning in context\" are present, but many are inconsistently translated or replaced with vague synonyms. Moreover, several terms are repeated verbatim or incorrectly adapted (e.g., \"ajuste fino\" vs. \"affinage\"). The terminology handling is erratic, and many explanations that should be simplified for the target audience are missing or incorrectly inserted. Thus the terminology score is modest.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original podcast’s tone is informal, explanatory, and aimed at a general audience. The translation fails to preserve this tone, instead presenting a mix of literal translation, explanatory notes, and unrelated sentences. Cultural nuances (e.g., references to specific Spanish idioms or conversational styles) are largely absent, and the adaptation does not reflect the intended Spanish‑speaking context. The score reflects this mismatch.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Important portions of the original dialogue (e.g., explanations of pre‑training, transfer learning, ICL, memory concepts) are either omitted, garbled, or replaced by repetitive commentary. Conversely, many irrelevant lines appear (such as translation instruction boxes), causing redundancy and loss of clarity. Therefore, the translation is incomplete and not faithful to the source text.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The submitted Spanish translation is largely unusable. It reads like a compilation of multiple translation drafts and explanatory notes rather than a coherent, faithful rendition of the French source. The dialogue loses its flow, many technical concepts are either mis‑translated or missing, and the reader would find it difficult to understand the intended meaning. Significant revisions are required to produce a clear, fluent, and accurate translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The overall quality is poor, and the translation falls far short of professional standards for subtitling or localization work. The final score is very low, reflecting the numerous deficiencies across all evaluation criteria. This translation would not be suitable for publication or broadcasting in its current form. It needs a complete rewrite focusing on clear narrative structure, correct terminology, natural phrasing, and faithful conveyance of the original content. The score assigned is 20 out of 120 possible points (1.67/6 average)."
