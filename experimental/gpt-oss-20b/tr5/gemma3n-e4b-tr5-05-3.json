  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely easy to understand and follows the original sentence flow closely. The concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning are explained in plain language. However, some sentences become a little long and could be broken down for better clarity, especially for non‑technical listeners. Overall readability is very good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation reads naturally, but a few expressions feel slightly awkward to native Spanish speakers. For example, “¡Hola y bienvenido/a a « Tech Éclair »” could be simplified to “¡Hola y bienvenidos a Tech Éclair!” and the slash “/” is unconventional. Additionally, the phrase “a la IA” is missing an article in places. Despite these minor issues, the overall fluency remains strong.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently and appropriately: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “grounding” → “anclaje”, “memoria” are all correct. No key terms are omitted or mistranslated, and the terminology matches the expected level for a general audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the tone to a Spanish‑speaking audience, using informal greetings and clear explanations. Cultural references are minimal, but the format of a podcast introduction is preserved. A few stylistic choices could be tweaked (e.g., use of quotation marks, article usage), but the overall intent and purpose are effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French transcript is present; nothing critical is omitted. The translation includes the same examples, analogies, and closing remarks. Minor redundancies are avoided, and the content remains concise. The only small omission is a missing article in “a la IA”, which does not significantly affect comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is very good, accurately conveying the meaning and technical content of the original French transcript. Readability and terminology are particularly strong. Fluency could be improved with minor adjustments to phrasing and punctuation to sound more natural to native speakers. The translation remains faithful to the source while being comprehensible and largely natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Overall, a high‑quality translation suitable for a podcast audience. 17.8/20 points overall, reflecting its strong performance with room for small stylistic refinements. 17.8"
