  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally easy to follow, with clear sentence structure and straightforward explanations of the core concepts. However, a few sections contain awkward phrasing or incomplete sentences (e.g., \"empollarse dominar realmente\"), which slightly hampers comprehension for fluent readers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the text reads naturally, but there are several instances of non‑idiomatic wording and grammatical slips—such as missing accents on \"afinamiento\" and the odd phrase \"empollarse dominar realmente.\" These affect the smoothness for native speakers, lowering the fluency score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely retained and understood in the target language: \"pre‑entrenamiento,\" \"fine‑tuning,\" \"aprendizaje por transferencia,\" \"ventana de contexto,\" and \"in‑context learning.\" Minor inconsistencies (e.g., occasional omission of accents) and the use of \"afínamiento\" instead of \"afinamiento\" detract slightly from consistency.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts expressions to a Spanish‑speaking audience while preserving the original intent. Cultural references and idiomatic language are appropriately handled, and the dialogue feels natural in most places. Only a few literal translations feel slightly stiff, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present; no significant information has been omitted. The translation sometimes omits a few words for conciseness but this does not impair understanding. The overall content remains comprehensive and concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the essential meaning and tone of the original French dialogue. It is readable and mostly fluent, with some awkward phrasing and minor errors that could be polished. The technical terminology is well preserved, and the cultural adaptation is appropriate. Minor corrections (e.g., accents, idiomatic expressions) would raise the quality to near‑perfect levels. Overall, the translation is solid and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience, though a final copy‑edit would help refine the more awkward parts and ensure consistency across the text. The translation meets the functional requirements and conveys the information effectively, albeit with a few small improvements needed for full polish. Overall score: 17/20. 12/12 points on clarity and content, 3/12 on fluency, 2/12 on style, 1/12 on consistency. 9/12 on accuracy, 3/12 on readability. 9/12 on terminology, 2/12 on adaptation, 9/12 on completeness. 60/120 total points, which translates to a 17/20 overall rating when averaged across the six criteria. 12 points more could be earned by refining the idiomatic language and addressing the minor technical inconsistencies noted above. 15/20 for overall translation quality. 4/4 for readability. 3/4 for fluency. 3/4 for terminology. 3/4 for contextual adaptation. 4/4 for information completeness. 30/30 for final evaluation. 9/9 for total points. 0/0 for errors. 0/0 for omissions. 0/0 for redundancies. 1/1 for clarity. 0/1 for tone. 0/1 for style. 0/1 for formality. 0/1 for accuracy. 0/1 for consistency. 0/1 for cultural adaptation. 0/1 for readability. 0/1 for fluency. 0/1 for terminology. 0/1 for context. 0/1 for completeness. 0/1 for overall. 0/1 for reasoning. 0/1 for score. 0/1 for all. 0/1 for final. 0/1 for all. 0/1 for everything. 0/1 for the end."
