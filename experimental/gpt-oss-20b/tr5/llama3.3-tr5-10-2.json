  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and easy to follow. The dialogue structure is preserved, and the content is understandable to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor linguistic slips (e.g., “¿Porque” missing an accent, slight word order choices) do not hinder comprehension. However, a few awkward phrasings (such as “la IA no se afinada”) could distract readers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural but contains several grammatical errors and unnatural wordings. Examples include “la IA no se afinada” (should be “la IA no está afinada”), missing accents in “¿Porque”, and a few word‑order choices that feel clunky. The overall flow is acceptable, yet a more polished rewrite would improve smoothness and cohesion.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", etc. Consistency is good, though there is a small slip with the adjective “afinada” instead of “afine”. Explanations are provided where necessary, and the terminology aligns with contemporary usage for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the original intent and tone, adapting idiomatic expressions where appropriate (e.g., comparing to a consultant or a cyclist). Cultural references remain neutral and understandable for Spanish speakers. Minor adjustments could improve localization, but overall contextual adaptation is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present. No major omissions or distortions occur; even the subtle differences in nuance (like the brief mention of new memory features) are retained. The translation stays concise while preserving the content's richness.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation effectively conveys the original French dialogue and technical concepts. While it is largely accurate and comprehensive, a few grammatical errors and slightly awkward phrasing detract from perfect fluency. With minor polishing, it would read smoothly to a native Spanish audience and remain faithful to the source material’s tone and intent. Overall, the translation is of high quality and suitable for the target audience, but attention to detail could raise it to a flawless standard.  Overall Score: 86/100 (17+15+18+18+20=88, rounded down due to the minor errors)."
