  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is heavily interspersed with meta‑notes (e.g., “1. Vocabulaire clé et expressions”) that break the flow of the dialogue. These comments make the text difficult to skim and obscure the conversational tone that the original French script conveys. The sentence structure is generally correct, but the interruption by explanatory blocks reduces overall comprehensibility for a casual listener. Hence the score is modest (≈7).",
      "score": 7
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most sentences are grammatically correct, many phrases sound unnatural in Spanish (e.g., “la IA se recuerda de estas informaciones”, “la IA no ha olvidado en el sentido humano”). There are also literal carry‑overs of French terminology and inconsistent use of “fine‑tuning”. The overall flow is acceptable but not smooth, warranting a score of 8.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms such as “pré‑entraînement” → “preentrenamiento” and “fine‑tuning” → “ajuste” are generally accurate. However, the translation switches inconsistently between “afinado”, “ajuste”, and keeps the English acronym “ICL” in several places. Explanations for some terms are missing. Thus the terminology is acceptable but not perfectly consistent, meriting 9.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The script’s informal, explanatory style is preserved, but the presence of French‑style comment blocks detracts from a culturally smooth Spanish version. Some references (e.g., “consultor” vs. “consultant”) are appropriate, yet the meta‑notes show a lack of polish. Score: 7.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All of the original content is present, but the addition of explanatory notes and some omitted clarifications (e.g., the nuance of “grounding”) slightly overloads the text. There is no major omission, but redundancy and extraneous commentary reduce conciseness. Score: 10.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely accurate in conveying the main ideas, but it suffers from a cluttered presentation due to inserted explanatory notes and occasional unnatural phrasing. A cleaner, more polished version would improve readability and fluency, and consistency in terminology would enhance professionalism. The text needs editing to remove the meta‑notes and smooth out awkward expressions before it can be considered ready for publication to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Overall, the quality is below average for a finished translation but acceptable as a draft that requires refinement. 8/20 overall score reflects these shortcomings while acknowledging the correct translation of the core content. 10/20 indicates the completeness but also the presence of unnecessary elements. 7–8/20 for readability, fluency, and contextual adaptation signal the need for further editing to achieve a natural, engaging podcast script in Spanish. 9/20 for terminology shows that the key terms are mostly handled correctly but could be more consistent. 10/20 for completeness confirms that nothing was omitted but the verbosity is a detriment.  A final refined version should aim for scores of 15–18/20 in each category.  The translation demonstrates solid understanding but lacks the polish expected for professional broadcast material.  8.2/20 overall is the average of the five criteria.  The draft requires editing, especially to remove explanatory interjections and improve naturalness."
