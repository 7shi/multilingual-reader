  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely comprehensible and follows a logical flow. Sentences are relatively long but remain coherent. Minor issues such as the phrase \"su espacio de trabajo temporal simplemente ha sido vaciado\" slightly affect naturalness but do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly overall, but there are a few grammatical slips (e.g., \"informaciones que parecen relevantes\" instead of the singular form, and the phrase \"le ha proporcionado\" is correctly used but the preceding clause contains a typo \"ha sido vaciado\"). Unnatural expressions such as \"hoja de respuestas\" instead of the more idiomatic \"copia de las respuestas\" appear once, but these are isolated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "All key technical terms are preserved and correctly rendered (preentrenamiento, afinación, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, memoria). The translation consistently uses these terms and gives sufficient context. The only potential issue is the word \"prompt\" retained in English; replacing it with \"indicaciones\" or \"entrada\" would improve consistency.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation captures the informal, conversational tone of the original French script and keeps the dialogue natural for a Spanish-speaking audience. Cultural references are minimal, so the translation stays faithful. Slight differences in formality (use of \"tú\" instead of formal \"usted\") reflect the casual nature of the podcast.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the original are present: pretraining, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, the temporary nature of ICL, the persistence of fine‑tuned knowledge, and the explanation of memory features. No significant omissions are noted. The explanation remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality. It preserves the original’s intent, conveys all technical content accurately, and reads naturally for native speakers. Minor grammatical tweaks and a more consistent handling of the word \"prompt\" would bring it to perfection, but it is already suitable for a broadcast audience."
