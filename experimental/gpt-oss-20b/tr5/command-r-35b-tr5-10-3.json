  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and follows a logical flow. The dialogue style is easy to follow and complex concepts are broken down in a way that native speakers can grasp. However, a few awkward constructions (e.g., *“En la IA no está siendo constantemente afinada por sus conversaciones”*) slightly hinder smooth comprehension. Overall, readability is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural and use contemporary vocabulary. Minor fluency issues arise with phrases that are grammatically correct but feel slightly stilted (e.g., *“El aprendizaje en contexto es como estudiar memorísticamente para un examen”*). These do not drastically affect understanding but could be polished.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *ICL*, *anclaje*, and *memoria* are correctly translated and consistently used. The only notable discrepancy is the change of the podcast name from *Tech Éclair* to *Tech Flash*, which breaks consistency. Apart from that, terminology is appropriate and well explained.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and maintains the conversational tone. Cultural adaptation is mostly adequate, but the renaming of the podcast shows a lapse in contextual fidelity. Minor idiomatic adjustments could improve local relevance, but overall the adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French transcript is present. There are no omitted explanations or critical details. The translation is concise and does not add unnecessary redundancy, keeping the content clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is strong, accurately conveying the original content and technical ideas. Minor issues—particularly the unintended name change and a few slightly awkward phrasings—prevent it from being flawless. With a few tweaks to enhance naturalness and consistency, it would reach a higher level of excellence. Overall, the translation demonstrates a good grasp of the source material and target language nuances, achieving a high quality suitable for native Spanish-speaking audiences, especially those familiar with AI terminology. The average score reflects this overall competence, while highlighting the areas that could benefit from refinement (e.g., maintaining the original podcast title and smoothing out a few idiomatic expressions)."
