  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, but several minor errors (missing accents, the odd phrase \"Entiendo Veo\", and some awkward punctuation) interrupt the flow. Overall, listeners can follow the dialogue, yet the readability is hindered by these small mistakes.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds mostly natural for a Spanish-speaking audience. However, expressions such as \"Es pues una memoria de un solo uso\" and the mix of formal/informal pronouns reduce smoothness. A few sentences feel literal or clunky, lowering overall fluency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly translated and largely consistent: pre-entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje. Minor inconsistencies (e.g., mixing \"grounding\" in parentheses, inconsistent use of \"Memoria\") do not majorly affect comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation remains faithful to the original intent but contains some cultural‑linguistic mismatches: the dialogue switches between \"tú\" and \"usted\", and the phrase \"Entiendo Veo\" is confusing. The humor and colloquial tone of the French version are somewhat lost in a few literal parts.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original is present, with no significant omissions. Some redundant or extraneous formatting (quotes around section titles) appears, but it does not detract from the core content.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the gist of the original podcast script and conveys the technical concepts accurately. Nevertheless, several grammatical errors, inconsistent pronoun usage, and awkward phrasing reduce clarity and naturalness. Refining these aspects would improve the overall quality significantly. The text is suitable for a general Spanish‑speaking audience, but it requires polishing before publication or broadcast to meet professional standards of fluency and readability. Overall, the translation is competent but leaves room for improvement in style and consistency. The overall score is 14/20, reflecting solid content translation with notable style and readability issues that could be addressed through a careful copy‑edit and cultural fine‑tuning. "
