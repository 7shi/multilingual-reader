  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is fragmented and difficult to follow. Sentences are often cut in the middle, punctuation is inconsistent, and the overall structure is chaotic. A native Spanish speaker would struggle to parse the content, especially when key concepts are split across lines or mixed with extraneous commentary. This severely hampers readability and comprehensibility.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural expressions and awkward grammar (e.g., \"¡Hola y bienvenidos a \"Tech Iluminado\"\", repeated and sometimes incorrect phrasing such as \"en el proceso llamado el \"pre-entrenamiento\"\"), inconsistent use of accents and punctuation, and an overall stilted tone. It does not read as natural, fluent Spanish.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are inconsistently rendered: \"pré-entraînement\" appears as \"pre-entrenamiento\" in some places and \"pré-entraînement\" in others; \"fine-tuning\" is translated as both \"afinamiento\" and \"ajuste fino\"; \"in‑context learning\" shows up as \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"Aprendizaje Conceptual Inductivo\", etc. Moreover, many key terms such as \"memory\", \"context window\", \"transfer learning\" are either omitted or poorly explained. Overall terminology appropriateness is weak.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original is a conversational podcast script. The translation adds meta‑comments, step‑by‑step instructions, and repeated explanatory boxes that are not present in the source. This dilutes the original intent and makes the text feel disjointed for the target audience. Cultural adaptation is minimal and often overwritten by untranslated fragments.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Many parts of the original are missing or truncated, and other parts are duplicated or inserted incorrectly. The translation omits key explanations about ICL, grounding, memory mechanisms, etc., and intersperses irrelevant commentary. Consequently, significant information is omitted, reducing overall completeness.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is highly fragmented and contains numerous inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and extraneous content. While it captures some of the original wording, it fails to provide a coherent, natural, and faithful rendition of the French source. Significant revisions are needed to achieve acceptable readability, fluency, terminology accuracy, contextual adaptation, and completeness."
