  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall understandable and the meaning of each paragraph is clear. The sentence structure is mostly logical, though a few long sentences could be broken up for easier reading. Overall, readers can follow the dialogue and grasp the concepts without major confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural to most Spanish speakers, but there are a handful of literal phrasings that feel slightly awkward (e.g., \"se le proporcionó una hoja de respuestas justo antes de que comenzara a hablar contigo\"). Some punctuation and accent use could be improved, yet the overall flow is smooth.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly rendered and consistently used. The translation keeps the technical nuance intact and explains terms when necessary.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, and adapts expressions to a Spanish-speaking audience. Minor cultural adjustments are present (e.g., using \"una hoja de respuestas\" instead of a literal \"cheat sheet\"), but the dialogue remains faithful to the source.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French script is retained. No major content is omitted, and the translation adds slight clarifications without redundancy. Minor phrasing differences do not alter the meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation effectively conveys the original dialogue, maintaining technical accuracy and readability. While a few expressions could be polished for greater naturalness, the overall quality is high and the translation serves its purpose for a Spanish-speaking audience. Minor stylistic adjustments would elevate it to near-perfect."
