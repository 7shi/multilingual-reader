  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, with clear sentence structure and logical flow. Minor issues arise in a few long sentences that could be split for easier reading, but overall the dialogue is easy to follow for native readers. 17/20",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places. Some idiomatic expressions feel slightly literal (e.g., \"pre-entrenamiento\" is acceptable but could be \"pre‑entrenamiento\" with a hyphen, and \"ajuste fino\" is correct but the word order could be smoother). There are a few minor grammatical quirks (e.g., \"cuidado de\" vs. \"cuidado con\") that do not impede comprehension. 16/20",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: \"fine‑tuning\" → \"ajuste fino\", \"in‑context learning\" → \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\". The choices are appropriate for a Spanish-speaking audience familiar with AI terminology, and the translator preserves the meaning of key concepts. 18/20",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts expressions to Spanish culture and idiom adequately. The use of formal/neutral Spanish fits the podcast style. Minor opportunities for further cultural tailoring exist (e.g., adjusting the phrase \"un brillante físico\" to better suit a Spanish audience), but overall the intent is preserved. 17/20",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All segments from the original are present; no major omissions or distortions. The translator retains the full dialogue, preserving jokes, analogies, and technical explanations. The only slight difference is a minor wording change that does not affect the conveyed information. 20/20",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, accurately conveying the original content and maintaining technical consistency. It reads smoothly for a Spanish-speaking audience, though a few expressions could be polished further for naturalness. Overall, it delivers the intended message effectively with minimal errors or omissions. The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of both source and target languages and effectively balances fidelity and fluency. The overall score reflects a very good translation. 18/20"
