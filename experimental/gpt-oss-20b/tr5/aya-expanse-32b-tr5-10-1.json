    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the logical flow of the original French dialogue. Sentences are concise, the narrative is easy to follow, and the use of dialogue markers (\"Camille:\"/\"Luc:\") clearly indicates speakers. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained with simple analogies that readers can grasp quickly. Minor structural repetitions exist but do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall, the translation reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker. The wording is natural and contemporary. However, there are a few slightly awkward constructions – for instance, \"Lo has comprendido a la perfección\" (better \"Lo has entendido perfectamente\") and \"apunte\" for \"notes\" (\"fragmentos\" or \"puntos clave\" might flow better). These minor issues do not significantly impede readability.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL). The Spanish equivalents are widely used in AI literature and are appropriate for the target audience. The translator maintains terminology fidelity while occasionally adding clarifying phrases that aid understanding.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the cultural context of Spanish-speaking audiences. Expressions such as \"consultor excepcional\" and the use of familiar idioms keep the tone conversational. Some phrases could be slightly refined (e.g., \"Lo olvida todo\" could be \"Olvida todo\" for a smoother feel), but the overall intent and nuance of the original French are preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French source is present. No significant omissions or additions alter the meaning. Redundancies are avoided, and the translation remains concise while fully covering the original content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the original French text's meaning, tone, and technical detail. Minor stylistic refinements could enhance fluency, but the current version is understandable, natural, and appropriate for a general Spanish-speaking audience interested in AI topics. The translator demonstrates strong command of both source and target languages, and the result is an accurate, clear, and engaging dialogue that preserves the educational intent of the podcast script. Overall, this is a commendable translation that would serve well in a real‑world broadcast or publication context. The average score across the evaluated criteria is 18.2, reflecting a strong, professional translation with room for minor polish in phrasing."
