  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is understandable for a general reader, but several sentences are truncated or missing connectors, making the flow uneven. Some passages (e.g., the opening of Luc’s line “desvelar…”) feel like fragments, and the repeated use of “la IA” without clear antecedent can confuse readers. However, the core concepts are still traceable.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several non‑native constructions and a few untranslated French words (“bachotage”). The syntax is often broken, and certain verbs are omitted or mis‑placed (“Luc: desvelar…”). While most vocabulary is correct, the overall rhythm of the dialogue is choppy, reducing naturalness for a fluent Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto* and *In‑Context Learning* are correctly rendered and consistently used. Some terms, like “grounding” and “bachotage”, are either left untranslated or introduced without explanation, which may confuse technically inclined readers. Overall, terminology is mostly accurate but could benefit from consistent labeling.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original dialogue style but does not deeply adapt idiomatic expressions or cultural references for a Spanish audience. The change from “Tech Éclair” to “Tech Flash” is a literal name change rather than a contextual one. Some phrases feel forced (e.g., “Todo está claro”), and the translation sometimes inserts explanatory notes that the original lacked. Thus adaptation is modest.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is present, but several lines are abbreviated or omitted, and some explanations are expanded or slightly altered. For instance, Luc’s line about the “pre‑training” is reduced to a single word, and the “grounding” concept is described differently. The main ideas remain, but there is a noticeable loss of nuance and some missing conversational turns.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation preserves the basic storyline and terminology but suffers from frequent sentence fragments, unnatural phrasing, and occasional loss of nuance. While it conveys the general message, native Spanish listeners may find the dialogue uneven and some technical terms unclear. A more thorough editing for flow, consistency, and completeness would significantly improve the overall quality."
