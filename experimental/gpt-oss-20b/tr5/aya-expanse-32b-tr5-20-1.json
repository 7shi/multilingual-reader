    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally clear and follows the structure of the original. Sentences are mostly logical and easy to follow. However, a few grammatical slips (e.g., “son temporales” → “es temporal”) and a typo (“El ACD” instead of “ICL”) slightly hinder smooth comprehension. Overall, readers can grasp the content with minor effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation flows naturally in most places, with idiomatic expressions and contemporary vocabulary. Some awkward constructions appear, such as “El ACD” and “la IA no se afina constantemente”. The switch between formal and conversational tones is handled well, but occasional literalisms (e.g., “prompt” kept in English) reduce naturalness. The text still sounds plausible to native Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje. The usage of “afinamiento” for fine‑tuning is appropriate, but the word “afina” is later used in a confusing way. The incorrect abbreviation “ACD” breaks consistency. Overall, terminology is mostly accurate but could benefit from tighter consistency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator keeps the playful tone of the French original and adapts cultural references sensibly. The brand name is partially translated (“Tecnología Relámpago”) but the original “Tech Éclair” reappears inconsistently at the end, which can confuse listeners. The adaptation generally respects the target audience’s context, yet minor adjustments would improve coherence.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present in Spanish. No substantive content is omitted, and the explanatory style is preserved. Minor typographical errors and a misplaced abbreviation do not alter meaning significantly, but they slightly affect clarity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers the core content and preserves the conversational, explanatory style of the original podcast. While readability and terminology are solid, some typographical mistakes and inconsistencies—especially the erroneous “ACD” and the mixed brand naming—lower the overall quality. With a few edits for consistency and grammar, the Spanish version would be close to publishable."
