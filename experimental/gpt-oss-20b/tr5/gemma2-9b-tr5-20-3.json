    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, but a noticeable mistake – the use of the French word *Parce que* instead of the Spanish *Porque* – interrupts the flow and could confuse readers. Sentences are generally logical, though some could be simplified for better clarity. Overall, readers can follow the dialogue with moderate effort.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text feels natural in many places, yet there are a few awkward constructions and inconsistent punctuation. The mix of French and Spanish (*Parce que*) is a clear faux‑pas. Word choices like *afianzamiento* are correct but less common than *ajuste fino*. Overall the fluency is acceptable but not flawless.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana contextual*, and *aprendizaje en contexto* are accurately rendered. The translation retains the acronym ICL and clarifies it in parentheses. Some terms like *grounding* are rendered as *ancrado*; while understandable, *anclaje* might be a more familiar choice for Spanish speakers. Consistency is generally maintained.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the opening greeting and cultural references to a Spanish‑speaking audience. The overall intent of the podcast is preserved. However, the French word *Parce que* slips into the Spanish text, undermining contextual coherence. Aside from that, cultural adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French dialogue are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No significant content is omitted, and redundant elements are largely avoided. The translation conveys the same depth of explanation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation communicates the main ideas clearly and maintains the conversational tone of the original. Minor issues—particularly the inadvertent insertion of a French word—affect readability and fluency but do not compromise overall understanding. With a few editorial tweaks, especially correcting *Parce que* to *Porque* and smoothing some phrasing, the translation would reach a higher level of polish. Overall, it is a competent and mostly faithful rendition of the source material, suitable for a general Spanish‑speaking audience who follows the podcast."
