  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, but the intermixing of French terms (e.g., \"l'IA\", \"pre-entraînement\") and the presence of explanatory bullet points interrupt the flow. Sentences are sometimes overly long or repetitious, which can impede comprehension for non‑expert listeners.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall, the translation reads smoothly, but there are several awkward constructions (e.g., \"El aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en contexto)\") and some literal phrasing that feels unnatural to native Spanish speakers. The mixture of French and Spanish terminology further disrupts fluency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are translated consistently: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"anclaje\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", etc. However, some terms (e.g., \"ICL\") are duplicated in parentheses, creating redundancy. Overall terminology handling is correct but could be tighter.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The podcast context is preserved, but the retention of French words and the inclusion of meta‑commentary break the natural Spanish podcast style. Cultural references are largely maintained, yet the adaptation would benefit from a more localized tone and the removal of untranslated French expressions.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present; no significant content is omitted. The addition of explanatory bullet points and meta‑analysis adds information but also introduces redundancy. The translation maintains the intended message.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is functional and conveys the core ideas, but its readability and fluency suffer from a mixture of languages and overly literal phrasing. Technical terminology is handled correctly, though some redundancy and unnecessary French terms weaken the overall polish. The content is complete, but a more refined adaptation would improve the listening experience for a Spanish audience. Overall, the translation is acceptable for an intermediate level but would need revision for a professional broadcast or publication context."
