  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is easy to read for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Sentences are mostly short and the logical flow mirrors the French original. A few compound sentences could be broken up for extra clarity, but overall the structure is coherent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places. Minor awkwardities appear, e.g. \"No necesita volver a aprender qué es un verbo\" and the slightly clunky phrase \"en lugar de enviarlo a un programa de formación de años\". Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, though occasional literal word choices could be smoothed out.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje\". Consistency is maintained throughout. The only small inconsistency is the use of \"preentrenamiento\" without the hyphen, but this is acceptable in Spanish.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation preserves the original intent and tone. Cultural references are handled appropriately (e.g., referring to a consultant as \"consultor\" or \"experto\"). The Spanish translation could improve some idiomatic expressions, but it effectively conveys the purpose of the podcast to a Spanish audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French source is present. No essential detail is omitted, and redundancy is minimal. The only slight omission is the explicit expansion of the abbreviation \"ICL\" as \"In‑Context Learning\", but this is understood from context.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is clear, largely faithful, and understandable to native speakers. Minor adjustments in fluency and a few stylistic tweaks would raise the quality to a near‑perfect level, but as it stands it is a competent rendering of the original French dialogue for a Spanish audience. Suggestions: simplify a few long sentences, replace literal expressions with more idiomatic equivalents, and consistently use hyphenation for terms like \"pre‑entrenamiento\" if desired for style consistency. Overall, a solid translation that serves its purpose well."
