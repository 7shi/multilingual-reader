  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is mostly readable; sentences are clear and the flow of the conversation is preserved. However, a few mistranslations and awkward phrasing (e.g., “la IA almacena…”, “bachotage”) slightly hinder comprehension, lowering the score to 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation uses natural Spanish in many places, but there are several instances of unnatural wording and punctuation errors (e.g., missing accents, misplaced commas, “anclaje” as a standalone line). These issues reduce smoothness, giving a 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered: IA, preentrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto. Inconsistencies arise with ‘In‑Context Learning (ICL)’ being left untranslated in some spots and ‘anclaje’ not fully explained, but overall terminology remains acceptable, 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Cultural references are largely maintained, and the tone fits a podcast transcript. Some phrases could be more idiomatic (e.g., “domina” instead of “comprende”), and a few expressions are slightly literal, resulting in a 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Key ideas are present, but there are inaccuracies: the text incorrectly states the AI stores information permanently, and the concept of grounding is not fully explained. Minor omissions and redundant parts reduce the score to 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is understandable but contains several inaccuracies and stylistic issues that affect clarity and naturalness. Terminology is largely correct, yet some terms are inconsistently handled. The overall quality is acceptable for a general audience but would benefit from a careful review to correct errors, improve phrasing, and ensure all concepts are accurately represented. The average score is around 14/20, indicating a solid but improvable translation."
