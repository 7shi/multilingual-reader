  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally readable and follows the conversational structure of the original. However, several lines are abruptly truncated (e.g., \"Luc: levantar el velo sobre cómo…\" and \"Camille: preentrenamiento\") or lack contextual framing, which can momentarily confuse the reader. Sentence length and punctuation are largely correct, but the occasional missing articles or prepositions make some exchanges feel slightly choppy.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The overall flow is acceptable for native speakers, yet there are a number of unnatural phrasings and punctuation errors that interrupt the natural rhythm of the dialogue. Phrases such as \"Luc: levantar el velo…\" are incomplete and not idiomatic. The translation sometimes uses direct, literal equivalents that feel mechanical, which reduces the conversational tone expected in a podcast script.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (aprendizaje en contexto)\", \"anclaje (grounding)\", and \"memoria\". Nonetheless, there is inconsistency (e.g., \"afinamiento\" vs. \"afinado\") and occasional missing explanatory context for terms that might be unfamiliar to a general audience. The overall terminology usage is appropriate but could benefit from a more uniform approach.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the intent and humor of the original French script, and it generally respects Spanish cultural expectations for a podcast format. Minor issues arise where literal translations of idiomatic expressions (e.g., \"preentrenamiento\" used as a standalone line) do not fully adapt to Spanish conversational patterns, but these do not severely hinder comprehension. Overall, the cultural adaptation is adequate.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French source are present: pretraining, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, short‑term memory, and the new memory feature. Some lines are slightly abbreviated, but no critical information is omitted. Redundancy is minimal, and the translation remains concise while retaining essential explanations.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the essential content and tone of the original French dialogue, but it suffers from a few structural and fluency issues that make parts feel abrupt or incomplete. Consistent terminology and smoother sentence construction would improve readability and naturalness. The overall quality is solid, yet it leaves room for polishing to reach a more professional podcast script level."
