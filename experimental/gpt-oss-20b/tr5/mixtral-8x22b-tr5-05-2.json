    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue is largely understandable; however, a few literal translations and word choice errors (e.g., \"en español\" instead of \"en francés\") interrupt the flow.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several phrases sound awkward or literal to a native speaker, such as \"el equivalente al bachotage\" and \"indicación\" used instead of *prompt*. The overall rhythm is acceptable but not entirely natural.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered (e.g., *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje en contexto*), but inconsistencies appear: the French word *affinage* is kept in places, and *bachotage* is used instead of a Spanish equivalent. Term consistency is therefore only moderate.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original structure but mixes the show’s name between *Tecno Flash* and *Tech Éclair*, which reduces coherence. Cultural adaptation is minimal; idiomatic expressions are largely literal.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all of the original content is present, with only minor omissions such as the introductory remark about the podcast being a black box. The overall message remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the main ideas and follows the dialogue format, but it suffers from several inaccuracies, literal phrasing, and inconsistencies that affect its naturalness and clarity. While the core technical explanations are preserved, the uneven adaptation and occasional mis‑translations lower the overall quality. A more careful review of terminology, cultural references, and consistency would improve the result significantly. Overall, the translation is acceptable for a general audience but requires refinement for professional use. The score reflects a weighted average of the criteria: 14 out of 20 points is an appropriate rating given the strengths and weaknesses observed."
