  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured and the flow mirrors the original. Some passages are long but still comprehensible. Minor punctuation issues slightly affect readability, but overall the audience can understand the concepts without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native Spanish speaker, but there are a few awkward phrasings (e.g., \"aprenderá el francés a una velocidad increíble\" could be smoother, \"el aprendizaje en contexto\" is fine but \"aprender en contexto\" is more idiomatic). Some compound sentences are a bit clunky and could benefit from segmentation. Vocabulary is contemporary, but occasional literal renderings (\"AIC\" instead of \"ICL\") reduce fluency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", and \"window of context\" are largely handled correctly. The translation consistently uses \"pre-entrenamiento\" and \"afinamiento\" for the French originals. However, the abbreviation \"AIC\" is an error (should be \"ICL\"), which could confuse readers. Otherwise, terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation preserves the original intent and humor. Cultural references are largely retained, and the dialogue format works for Spanish audiences. Some idiomatic expressions could be more localized (e.g., \"aprender en contexto\" vs \"aprender en el contexto\") and the term \"window of context\" is not fully rendered into a Spanish equivalent. Overall, context is respected.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation includes all major ideas from the French source. Minor omissions exist, such as the nuance of \"window of context\" and the slight mis‑labeling of \"AIC\". Redundancy is generally avoided, but a few phrases are repeated unnecessarily. No critical information is missing.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and largely faithful to the original French script. It communicates the technical concepts clearly and maintains the conversational tone. Minor issues in fluency, terminology consistency (the abbreviation error), and contextual nuance slightly diminish the overall quality. With small revisions, the text would be near‑perfect for a native Spanish audience.\n\nAverage score across the five criteria is 16.4, rounded to 16 out of 20, indicating good but not flawless quality.\n\nOverall score: 16/20."
