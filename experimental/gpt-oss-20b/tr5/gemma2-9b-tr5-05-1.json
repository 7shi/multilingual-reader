  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely comprehensible, but contains a few awkward or incorrect phrases that interrupt the flow – e.g. “Parque que ya comprende” instead of “Porque ya comprende”. The logical structure is preserved, and the speaker dialogue is easy to follow, so the overall readability is solid but not flawless.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly in most places, yet there are several spots where the wording feels literal or slightly off: “Parque” for “Porque”, “aprende francés a una velocidad increíble” is fine, but “Se olvida de todo” is a bit blunt. Overall it sounds natural but would benefit from minor polishing.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally handled correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, afianzamiento (fine‑tuning), aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, anclaje (grounding). The choice of ‘afianzamiento’ instead of the more common ‘ajuste fino’ is a stylistic variation but remains understandable. Terminology is consistent across the transcript.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and conversational tone suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are preserved, but a few mis‑translations (“Parque”) undermine the adaptation slightly. No major cultural adjustments were needed, but the translation could use more idiomatic phrasing in places.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present, including the explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning. No substantial omissions were detected; the content is concise and covers the same concepts.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is generally accurate and conveys the main ideas of the original podcast. It maintains the conversational style and technical content, but there are a few linguistic slips that could be smoothed out. With minor corrections, it would be an excellent Spanish version for native speakers to understand the concepts discussed in the episode. The overall quality is good, but attention to small errors would elevate it further to a near‑perfect level. The total score reflects these observations, aiming for a balanced assessment across all criteria. This translation should be usable as-is for most readers, with a brief review to correct the minor issues noted above."
