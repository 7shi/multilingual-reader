  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is heavily fragmented and frequently contains incomplete sentences, abrupt transitions, and nonsensical fragments such as \"Hola\", \"Hola mundo\" and repeated placeholders. These disruptions make it difficult for a reader to follow the narrative or grasp the intended meaning. The structure is disjointed, and many paragraphs are cut off, resulting in a low level of readability.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is riddled with unnatural phrasing and grammatical errors. Common conversational expressions are missing or replaced by literal, awkward wording. The flow feels choppy and many sentences are left unfinished, which detracts significantly from the naturalness of the text.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"pré-entraînement\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"ICL\" and \"grounding\" are either omitted, mistranslated, or inconsistently rendered. The translation lacks the necessary consistency and does not provide explanatory paraphrases where appropriate, leading to confusion for a reader unfamiliar with the terminology.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent and cultural nuances of a French‑speaking podcast are not captured. Many idiomatic expressions and contextual references are lost or replaced by generic placeholders, failing to adapt the content to Spanish‑speaking audiences.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Significant portions of the original dialogue are missing or garbled. Critical explanations about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and context‑learning are truncated, which results in a substantial loss of information and meaning.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is severely deficient. It contains numerous omissions, grammatical mistakes, and incoherent segments that hinder comprehension. The intended technical explanation is largely lost, making the text unusable for its intended audience. A complete revision with careful attention to structure, terminology, and context is required to meet quality standards."
