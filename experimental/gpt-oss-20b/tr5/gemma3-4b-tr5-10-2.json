    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to understand. The dialogue flows naturally and the main concepts are conveyed. Some sentences are slightly awkward (e.g., “¿Entonces? / ¿Aclaración? / ¿Qué quieres decir?”) and a few words are misplaced, but overall the script is coherent and readers can follow the conversation without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly in most parts, but there are a few non‑native expressions and punctuation errors. \"enraizamiento\" is not a standard term for \"grounding\" and the phrase \"¿Entonces? / ¿Aclaración? / ¿Qué quieres decir?\" sounds like a list of questions rather than a natural dialogue. The rest of the text uses appropriate verb forms and syntax, but small corrections would improve naturalness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are correctly translated and used consistently. The only inconsistency is the use of \"enraizamiento\" instead of the accepted \"anclaje\" or \"fundamentación\" for \"grounding\". Overall, terminology is accurate and clear for a general audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the casual, conversational tone of the original French podcast. Cultural references are appropriately adapted for Spanish listeners. Minor improvements could be made in phrasing to make idioms feel more native (e.g., \"en lugar de enviarlo a realizar un programa de formación de varios años\" could be \"en vez de enviarlo a un programa de formación de varios años\"). Nonetheless, the overall intent and humor are maintained.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost every line of the original is represented. No key concept is omitted, and the dialogue structure is intact. Minor details such as the exact wording of the phrase \"Lo has entendido\" (from \"Vous avez tout compris\") and the small omission of the term \"ajuste fino\" in one spot do not materially affect understanding. The translation is exhaustive and avoids unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is very solid and faithfully conveys the content and tone of the original French podcast. Readability and terminology are particularly strong, and the text remains informative and engaging. Fluency and contextual adaptation could be refined with minor edits—especially by replacing the odd \"enraizamiento\" with a more conventional term and smoothing some dialogue fragments. Overall, the translation is highly usable for a Spanish‑speaking audience and requires only light polishing to reach a native‑level standard."
