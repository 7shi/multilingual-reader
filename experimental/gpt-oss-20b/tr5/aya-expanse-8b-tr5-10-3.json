  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but several sentences are awkwardly structured or ambiguous. Phrases such as \"la IA 'se recuerda' de esta información\" and the repetition of long explanatory clauses make the flow feel forced. Nonetheless, the overall meaning is accessible to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural expressions and grammatical mistakes: \"la IA 'se recuerda' de esta información\" (should be \"la IA recuerda esta información\"), repeated and slightly clumsy phrasing, and some literal word‑for‑word transfer that disrupts the natural rhythm of Spanish. The overall prose reads more like a direct translation than a polished dialogue.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms are generally preserved (pre‑training → pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning → afinamiento, transfer learning → aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL → aprendizaje en contexto). However, some terms are inconsistently handled: \"ancrage\" remains in French instead of being translated to \"anclaje\". Minor discrepancies reduce the consistency of terminology usage.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation to a Spanish podcast context is acceptable—titles and conversational style are preserved. Yet, certain expressions that rely on cultural nuances (e.g., metaphorical comparisons) are translated too literally, diminishing their impact. The translator kept the overall intent, but some phrasing feels out of place in everyday Spanish conversation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely retains the full content of the original script. No major omissions are apparent, and the sequence of dialogue is maintained. Some explanatory details are slightly rephrased, but the essential meaning remains intact. Redundancies were largely preserved, mirroring the original style.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the main ideas and follows the conversational flow of the original podcast script, but it suffers from a number of grammatical inaccuracies, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent terminology. While most of the information is present and comprehensible, the text would benefit from a more natural, idiomatic rewrite and careful correction of technical terms that were left untranslated or incorrectly rendered. With targeted edits, the translation could reach a higher level of quality and readability for a native Spanish audience."
