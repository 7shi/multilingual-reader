    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely understandable, but several sentences are awkwardly constructed and occasionally confusing (e.g., \"El aprendizaje en contexto es del bachotaje\" or the misuse of “afino” instead of “afinado”). Missing accents and inconsistent punctuation also impede smooth reading. The overall flow is okay, but these issues reduce readability, so a score around 13/20 is justified.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation often sounds mechanical and contains grammatical slips (missing accents, incorrect gender agreement, unnatural word order). Phrases such as \"El aprendizaje en contexto es del bachotaje\" and \"El afino\" are not idiomatic. While most words are correct, the overall naturalness is noticeably lower than a native‑level translation, meriting about 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms are generally preserved (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL). However, the word for fine‑tuning is rendered incorrectly as \"afino\" instead of \"afinado\" or \"ajuste fino\", which is a significant slip. Some explanations are missing or awkward (e.g., “ajuste” vs “fine‑tuning”). Consistency across the text is acceptable but not perfect, leading to a score of 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent of the podcast dialogue is maintained, and cultural references (consultor, especialista) are adapted reasonably. The translator does not lose major ideas, but some nuances are lost (e.g., the subtle humor about the AI being a “consultor brillant”). The text reads well for a Spanish audience, though a few culturally specific touches could be refined. Score: 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most content from the original is present, but some details are glossed or incorrectly phrased. The explanation of ICL as \"del bachotaje\" misrepresents the concept, and the transition from pre‑training to fine‑tuning lacks clarity in a few spots. No major omissions, but redundancies and slight inaccuracies affect overall completeness, warranting 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the main ideas and maintains the conversational tone of the original, yet it is marred by a number of linguistic inaccuracies and awkward phrasings that hinder naturalness and precision. Improving grammar, aligning terminology consistently, and refining some of the more idiomatic expressions would substantially raise the quality. The current version is passable but would benefit from a careful revision to meet professional standards for a native Spanish audience. Overall, it merits a moderate score of 13/20 for its strengths, with clear room for improvement in fluency and terminology accuracy."
