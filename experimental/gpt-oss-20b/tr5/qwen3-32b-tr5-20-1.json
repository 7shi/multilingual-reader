  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly short and the flow mirrors the original structure. Minor issues such as missing commas or slightly abrupt transitions in a few lines make the text marginally less readable, but the core ideas remain clear.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds fairly natural, yet there are a few awkward phrasings (e.g., “la IA no se va afinando”, “hoja de trucos”) that feel slightly literal or colloquial. Overall grammatical correctness is good, but these small glitches lower the smoothness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently handled: *pre-entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)*, *anclaje*, *ventana de contexto*, *memoria a corto plazo*. Explanations are present where needed, and terminology matches contemporary Spanish usage.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the original intent and tone. Cultural references are appropriate for Spanish‑speaking audiences, though a few expressions could be polished for greater naturalness. No major misinterpretations are present.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are included; no significant omissions or redundancies. The added explanations aid comprehension without sacrificing concision.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version faithfully reproduces the content and technical details of the original French script. While readability and fluency are strong, a few awkward phrasings slightly detract from a completely smooth listening experience. Overall, the translation is high quality and suitable for a native Spanish audience."
