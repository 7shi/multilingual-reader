  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is overall clear and easy to follow. Sentence structures mirror the original and the ideas are expressed coherently. Minor awkward phrasing such as “Los conocimientos que proporcionas en el prompt” is understandable but could be smoother. No major omissions or confusing passages.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally in most places, but there are several instances of unnatural wording or punctuation. The abbreviation ‘AICL (Aprendizaje In-contextual)’ is incorrect and ‘Aprendizaje In-contextual’ is not idiomatic Spanish. The phrase ‘Los nuevos conocimientos’ also feels slightly clunky. Overall fluency is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved (preentrenamiento, fine-tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, anchoring/grounding). The translation of ICL is incorrect (AICL) and the phrase ‘Aprendizaje In-contextual’ is not standard. However, the rest of the terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation takes into account cultural references (consultant metaphor) and explains concepts in a way that Spanish-speaking audiences can relate to. Minor stylistic choices could be improved, but overall the intent and tone of the original are maintained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present. The explanation about memory, fine-tuning vs. ICL, and the discussion on 'memory' features are fully covered. No significant omissions, though the mislabeling of ICL may cause slight confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid overall, with clear conveyance of technical concepts and good contextual adaptation. A few terminology errors (incorrect abbreviation and phrasing) and some minor fluency issues detract from perfect polish, but the translation remains comprehensible and faithful to the original content. It would benefit from a final proofread to correct the ICL abbreviation and to smooth a few awkward phrasings. Overall, a very competent translation with room for minor refinement. 17/20 is a reasonable aggregate score for this version. 17.0"
