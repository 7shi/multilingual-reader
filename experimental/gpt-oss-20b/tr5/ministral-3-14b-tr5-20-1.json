  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow, with sentence structures that mirror the original. However, some parts feel slightly choppy (e.g., “Lo olvida todo.” is abrupt). Overall, readers can grasp the concepts, but a few awkward connectors reduce the smoothness slightly.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most expressions sound natural, but there are a handful of literal‑style constructions (“descubrimos”, “para el proyecto en curso”) and occasional missing accents or articles. These do not impede understanding, yet they prevent the text from sounding fully idiomatic.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are preserved: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “anclaje”, “Memoria”. The translations are correct and consistent. Minor improvement could be made by adding a brief definition for “ICL”.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation captures the informal, conversational tone of a podcast. Cultural references are minimal and thus not problematic. A few phrasings are still literal (e.g., “para el proyecto en curso”), but overall the intent is conveyed clearly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Nearly all original content is present; the script’s dialogue and key points are intact. Small omissions (bold formatting, some parenthetical clarifications) are not essential for comprehension. The text is concise without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and largely faithful to the original. While the language is generally clear and the technical terms are handled correctly, occasional literal phrasing and minor stylistic issues prevent it from achieving a perfect score. Nonetheless, it conveys the intended message effectively for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
