  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally easy to read and follows a logical structure. Sentences are short and clear, and the conversational tone is preserved. However, a few minor issues such as the slightly awkward phrasing in \"El aprendizaje en contexto es el apretar\" and the repeated use of \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\" reduce overall smoothness. Overall, readers can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly natural, but there are several instances of unnatural wording and grammatical mistakes. For example, \"El aprendizaje en contexto es el apretar\" is incorrect and sounds odd to native speakers. Phrases such as \"en vez de reentrenar la IA para hacerla una especialista\" would be more idiomatic as \"en lugar de reentrenar la IA para convertirla en una especialista\". These quirks lower the fluency score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are generally translated correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\". However, the translation of \"grounding\" as \"sostén\" in one spot and the incorrect rendering of \"in‑context learning\" as \"apretar\" (instead of a proper explanation or \"aprendizaje en contexto\") introduces confusion. Consistency is otherwise good. The terminology score reflects these minor inaccuracies.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the original intent and conversational style. Cultural adaptation is adequate: the metaphor of a consultant and the mention of a \"consultor brillante\" are familiar to Spanish speakers. Minor expressions could be improved for naturalness, but the overall message and tone are preserved. Therefore the score is relatively high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are present in the Spanish version. There are no significant omissions. Some redundancy exists, but this does not detract from clarity. The main issue is the mis‑translation of the phrase about \"apretar\" which slightly alters the meaning, but the overall information remains complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and largely faithful to the source text, conveying the main ideas and maintaining the conversational tone. However, there are notable issues with fluency and terminology accuracy that could confuse native readers. With a few refinements, the quality would be considerably higher."
