  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the concepts are explained in a straightforward manner. Some long sentences (e.g., the explanation of the fine‑tuning process) could be broken up for better flow, but overall the structure is logical and readers can understand the content without much difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly in Spanish, with appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic expressions. Minor issues include the use of \"vuestras\" (which may sound slightly formal or group‑specific) and a couple of slightly awkward phrasing such as \"la IA no se afina constantemente con vuestras conversaciones.\" These do not severely hinder comprehension but slightly detract from naturalness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" (anclaje). The translation keeps the technical accuracy of the original and provides clear explanations where needed.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original intent and cultural references appropriately. The greeting \"¡Hola y bienvenido/a a « Tech Éclair »\" mirrors the French opening, and the dialogue style is preserved. Minor cultural adjustments (e.g., using Spanish punctuation and capitalization) are correctly applied.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is retained in the Spanish version. No key points are omitted, and the additional explanations (e.g., about the memory feature) are fully included. The content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the meaning, tone, and technical detail of the original French text. A few small phrasing choices could be refined for greater naturalness, but overall the Spanish version reads well, uses correct terminology, and preserves all essential information. Minor polishing would bring it to near‑perfect fluency and readability. Overall, it is an effective and professional translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts and podcast content. The final score is 17.6/20, reflecting strong performance across all criteria with room for slight improvements in flow and natural phrasing.  The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of both source and target languages, making it a reliable resource for Spanish‑speaking listeners."
