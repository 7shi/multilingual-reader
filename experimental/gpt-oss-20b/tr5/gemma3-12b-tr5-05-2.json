  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text follows the same logical order as the original. Sentences are generally clear and easy to follow. Minor punctuation or article issues (e.g., \"Se olvida de todo\") do not hinder comprehension. Complex concepts such as transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained with simple comparisons, which helps readers grasp them quickly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The overall flow is natural, but a few phrases feel slightly literal or carry English influence. For instance, \"se le proporcionan los documentos de información precisos\" could be more idiomatic as \"le proporcionan los documentos precisos\", and the repeated use of \"prompt\" instead of a fully Spanish equivalent (e.g., \"instrucción\" or \"consulta\") feels somewhat jarring to a native reader. Nonetheless, the translation reads smoothly in most places.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje (grounding)\". The translation preserves the original terminology while keeping it understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. No critical terms were omitted or mistranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Cultural adaptation is good. Phrases like \"consultor brillante\" and the use of colloquial terms such as \"bachatear\" fit Spanish usage. The translation keeps the conversational tone of a podcast and adapts idiomatic expressions appropriately. Minor room for improvement exists in localizing some phrasing (e.g., better Spanish equivalents for \"prompt\"), but overall it serves the target audience well.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the original French transcript is present in the Spanish version. No essential information was omitted, and the flow remains consistent. The translation does not add extraneous material and avoids redundancy, maintaining a concise yet clear presentation.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation effectively conveys the original French podcast’s content. It is largely readable, fluent, and technically accurate, with a few minor stylistic tweaks needed to make it sound more idiomatic to native speakers. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nAverage score: 17.4/20, which indicates strong performance across all criteria with small areas for polish.\n\nScore: 17.4 out of 20 points."
