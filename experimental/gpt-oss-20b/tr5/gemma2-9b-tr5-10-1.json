  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is overall clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the explanation of complex concepts such as pre‑training and in‑context learning is understandable. Minor issues – such as missing articles (“el aprendizaje en contexto” instead of “aprendizaje en contexto”) – slightly affect readability but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker. However, there are a few awkward phrasings and article omissions that break the natural flow (e.g., “aprendizaje en contexto” without “el”, “ancrado” instead of the more idiomatic “anclaje”). Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, but these small inconsistencies lower the fluency score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, memoria a corto plazo, ventana de contexto. Only the translation of “ancrage” as “ancrado” could be improved to “anclaje” for greater accuracy, but overall terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and uses culturally suitable expressions (e.g., “consultor brillante”, “experto permanente”). It adapts well to Spanish-speaking audiences while maintaining the original style and tone. No major contextual issues are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present. No important information is omitted, and the translation does not add extraneous details. Redundancies are minimal, and the content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, effectively conveying the technical content while remaining accessible to Spanish readers. Minor grammatical adjustments—especially concerning article usage and idiomatic choices—would bring the translation to near‑perfect fluency and readability. The terminology is precise and consistent, and the adaptation respects the target audience’s cultural context. Overall, the translation is well‑executed and only requires small polish to reach excellence."
