  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the overall structure and sequence of the original dialogue, making the content largely understandable to Spanish‑speaking listeners. However, a few sentences contain missing punctuation or slightly awkward word order (e.g., *«La forma en que la IA \"almacena\" esa información, ya que la diferencia entre un conocimiento temporal y una habilidad permanente es clave.»*), which may momentarily hinder smooth comprehension. Overall, the text remains clear and logical, but the presence of these minor issues slightly reduces its readability score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly smoothly for a native Spanish speaker, using appropriate vocabulary and sentence structures. Nonetheless, there are a few noticeable flaws: the use of the colloquial term *«resetado»*, the phrase *«en la sombra»* that feels awkward, and a clear French fragment (*«Ce sería…»*) that breaks the flow. These irregularities lower the fluency score, though the general naturalness of the dialogue is maintained.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *«preentrenamiento»*, *«afinamiento»*, *«aprendizaje por transferencia»*, *«ventana de contexto»*, *«in‑context learning (ICL)»*, and *«anclaje»* are accurately rendered and consistently used throughout the text. The occasional retention of the English word *«prompt»* is acceptable given its widespread use in the AI community. Minor inconsistencies are limited, so the terminology handling is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts several expressions to suit Spanish‑speaking audiences, such as turning *«affinage»* into *«afinamiento»* and adding clarifying remarks (*«El preentrenamiento es un tema que percibimos como fundamental…»*). Despite these adaptations, the translation occasionally inserts non‑Spanish phrasing or cultural references that feel slightly out of place (e.g., *«en la sombra»*). The overall intent of the original is preserved, but the presence of the French fragment indicates a lapse in contextual consistency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French script are present: the stages of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, and the new memory feature. The translator sometimes adds explanatory remarks, which enriches comprehension but does not omit any essential information. The only significant problem is the accidental inclusion of a French fragment (*«Ce sería…»*), which is a typographical error rather than an omission. Thus the translation is largely complete and concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the essence and technical details of the original French dialogue while maintaining a clear conversational flow. The major strengths lie in accurate terminology usage and a faithful representation of the content. However, the presence of a French fragment, some colloquial phrasing, and a few awkward word choices diminish the overall polish. With minor proofreading and adjustment of the less natural expressions, the translation would achieve a higher level of quality and fluency. The current version is good but not perfect, suitable for listeners who can tolerate occasional slips but may benefit from a final edit for a professional release.  Total score: 83/100. "
