  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand, with clear explanations of concepts like pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning. Sentence structure follows the original fairly well, and the use of dialogue makes the content accessible. Minor issues such as the phrase “lo han entendido todo” create a slight moment of confusion, but overall the flow remains logical.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, there are a few awkward expressions: the plural verb in “lo han entendido todo” should be singular, the use of “la forma en que la IA «recuerda»” is oddly punctuated, and the phrase “tú le has dado una chuleta” is colloquial and slightly informal. Despite these quirks, the overall tone is smooth and understandable.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled accurately: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, memoria. The translations are consistent throughout and reflect contemporary terminology used in AI discussions in Spanish. No major mis‑translations or omissions are present.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational style. Some cultural nuances (e.g., “¡Una analogía perfecta!”) fit Spanish-speaking audiences. The only slight mismatch is the informal “le has dado una chuleta” which may not suit a formal podcast script. Overall, the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French source is retained. The translation does not omit any important concept, and redundancy is minimal. The small grammatical slip in “lo han entendido todo” does not alter the conveyed meaning. The content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the content, tone, and terminology of the original French script. Minor grammatical and stylistic adjustments would bring it to a fully polished level, but it is already functional and readable for a native Spanish audience. The overall score reflects a well‑executed translation with room for minor refinements in fluency and punctuation consistency. The translation meets the objectives of clarity, naturalness, and technical accuracy, making it suitable for the intended podcast audience. A final review to correct the plural/singular mismatch and streamline a few colloquial expressions would elevate the translation to perfection. Overall, it is a strong, competent rendering that effectively serves its purpose within the podcast context.  (Score: 89/100)."
