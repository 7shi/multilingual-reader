  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely comprehensible; the sentence structure follows the original closely and complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning) are presented clearly. Minor issues arise from repeated use of “Efectivamente,” which slightly interrupts the flow, but overall readers can easily follow the dialogue.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a Spanish speaker in most places, with appropriate use of punctuation and connectors. Some expressions feel a little mechanical (e.g., repeated “Efectivamente,” “parten” instead of the more common “parten”) and a few English terms remain untranslated (fine‑tuning, ICL). These minor quirks reduce fluency marginally.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are handled well: \"preentrenamiento,\" \"fine‑tuning,\" \"aprendizaje en contexto,\" \"grounding\". The use of English terms is acceptable in a tech context, though a fully Spanish equivalent (ajuste fino, aprendizaje en contexto) could improve consistency. Overall, terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references are minimal, but the use of everyday phrasing (“consultor brillante”) aligns with Spanish listening habits. Minor adjustments could better fit Spanish idioms, but adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines and explanations from the original are present. No significant information is omitted, and redundancy is avoided. The translation remains concise while retaining the depth of the original discussion.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "This Spanish translation is clear, well‑structured, and largely faithful to the original French. Minor repetitive phrasing and the occasional retention of English technical terms slightly detract from perfect fluency, but the overall quality is high. The text is accessible to native Spanish speakers and effectively conveys the technical concepts discussed in the podcast episode. With a few stylistic refinements, it would achieve near‑perfect readability and naturalness in Spanish communication."
