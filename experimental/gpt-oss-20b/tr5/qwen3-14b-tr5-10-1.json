  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the overall narrative structure and most sentences are easy to understand for a Spanish-speaking audience. Some wording such as *“para darle una cultura general”* feels a little literal, but it does not hinder comprehension. The flow is logical and the dialogue format is maintained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text generally reads smoothly, but several phrases are slightly awkward or less idiomatic – e.g., *“para darle una cultura general”* instead of *“para dotarla de cultura general”*, and *“preentrenamiento”* is spelled correctly but could benefit from a more natural verb form. Minor punctuation inconsistencies also affect naturalness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia* and *aprendizaje en contexto* are correctly translated and consistently used. The term *In‑Context Learning* is rendered as *aprendizaje en contexto*, which is acceptable in Spanish technical literature. No major terminological errors were detected.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the informal, conversational tone of the original podcast. Cultural references are appropriately adapted (e.g., the opening “Hola y bienvenida”). The use of quotation marks and italics is consistent, and the Spanish title remains the same, maintaining brand identity. Overall, contextual adaptation is very good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue and explanatory content from the French source is present in the Spanish version. No substantive omissions or additions that would alter meaning were found. Redundancy is minimal, and the translation stays concise while preserving clarity.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the essence of the original podcast, keeping the dialogue natural and the technical explanations clear. While there are minor fluency and wording issues that could be smoothed out, the translation is largely accurate, readable, and faithful to the source material. It would benefit from a quick proofreading to refine idiomatic expressions and punctuation for a polished final product."
