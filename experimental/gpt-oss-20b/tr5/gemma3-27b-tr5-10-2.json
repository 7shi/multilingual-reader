  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely understandable and the sentence structure follows a logical flow. Minor issues such as the plural pronoun mismatch in \"Imaginen\" and a few overly long sentences slightly reduce readability, but overall the content is clear for native Spanish readers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads well in many places, but some expressions feel awkward or non‑idiomatic. Notably, the section \"¿A qué te refieres? / ¿Qué quieres decir? / ¿O sea?\" adds extraneous options that were not present in the source. Formatting choices (italicizing technical terms with asterisks) also break the natural flow. These factors lower the fluency score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"fine-tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"grounding\", \"in-context learning\" (aprendizaje en contexto). The terminology is consistent and matches the target audience's level of understanding. Minor inconsistencies in formatting (italics, asterisks) are noted but do not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, including the brand name \"Tech Éclair\". Cultural adaptation is adequate, though some phrasing could be more idiomatic (e.g., \"en la ventana de contexto\" instead of \"en la ventana de contexto\"). Overall, the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original is present. The added set of clarifying questions for \"O sea?\" is unnecessary but does not omit any content. No major omissions or redundancies are detected. The text remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation accurately conveys the technical content and maintains the conversational tone of the original. However, it includes an unnecessary list of alternative phrasing for \"O sea?\" and contains a few awkward or non‑idiomatic expressions. Minor edits to improve naturalness and consistency would bring the quality to a higher level. Overall, it is a competent translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience with some room for polishing.  The overall score reflects solid translation quality with room for improvement in fluency and slight refinement in wording and formatting.  The final score is 17/20, acknowledging the translation's strengths while noting the areas for improvement.  The reasoning above details the specific strengths and weaknesses that contributed to this assessment."
