  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable for native readers, with clear explanations of key concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning. Sentence structures are mostly logical, and the dialogue format aids comprehension. However, the repeated “Camille :” prefixes and some abrupt line breaks interrupt flow, slightly reducing readability. Minor awkward phrasing (“La IA no es constantemente afinada por tus conversaciones”) also affects ease of reading. Overall, the text remains readable but could be polished.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally smooth, but there are several unnatural or repetitive expressions. The duplicated “Camille :” tags at the beginning of lines are a formatting error that disrupts natural speech. Phrases like “La IA no se ajusta continuamente a partir de sus conversaciones. Sería increíblemente ineficaz.”, while grammatically correct, feel slightly stilted. Word choices such as “memoria” for the feature and “ajuste fino” are fine, yet occasional syntax issues (“El propio modelo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus conversaciones”) make the text less fluid than it could be. Overall, fluency is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje\", \"memoria\". The translation also includes brief explanations where appropriate (e.g., the analogy of learning a language). Minor formatting inconsistencies (hyphen vs no hyphen in pre‑training) do not materially affect understanding. Overall, terminology is appropriate and reliable.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and conversational tone, which suits a podcast audience. Cultural references are preserved without inappropriate localization. The Spanish version does not introduce culturally specific terms that might confuse listeners. However, the repeated “Camille :” prefixes can be seen as a mistranslation of the formatting rather than a contextual adaptation issue. Otherwise, the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is present in the Spanish version; no major omissions or distortions occur. The structure of dialogues, explanations, and examples remains intact. The duplication of speaker labels is a form of redundancy rather than omission. Therefore, the translation is complete and concise while preserving key details.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the core ideas of the original French podcast script and uses appropriate technical vocabulary. It is readable and generally fluent, but suffers from formatting errors (repeated speaker labels) and some slightly awkward phrasing that could be smoothed out. With minor editorial cleanup, the translation would meet a high standard for a native‑Spanish audience listening to a technology podcast. Overall, it is a solid effort with room for polishing in style and consistency.\n\nOverall score: 16/20 (balanced across clarity, fluency, and terminology)."
