    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable; the sentence structure is mostly logical and the flow follows the original. Some sentences, however, read a bit stiffly (e.g., “Tienes todo claro” instead of a more natural “Entiendes todo”), which slightly reduces clarity. Overall, readers can grasp the concepts without much difficulty.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally smooth, but there are several instances of awkward phrasing and minor grammatical errors (e.g., “informaciones” should be “información”, “Tienes todo claro” is somewhat informal). Some words are translated literally, making the prose feel a bit mechanical. Nonetheless, it remains readable for native Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding (anclaje). The translator keeps important English terms in parentheses, which aids comprehension for a tech‑savvy audience. Terminology is consistent throughout.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational tone is preserved, and the translation takes into account Spanish-speaking cultural context. Minor cultural adaptations are adequate, though some expressions could be more idiomatic. Overall, the intent of the original is effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present; no essential information is omitted. The translation does not add unnecessary repetition and keeps the content concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the original meaning well, but a few awkward phrasing and small grammatical slips affect its polish. It would benefit from a final round of copy‑editing to smooth out the flow and correct minor errors. Overall, the translation meets the core objectives and would be easily understood by Spanish-speaking listeners of a tech podcast."
