  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation presents the concepts in a clear and logical order, using simple sentence structures that a general audience can follow. Technical ideas are explained without excessive jargon. Minor fragments (e.g., “El ajuste fino.”) slightly interrupt flow, but overall readability is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly in Spanish, with mostly natural phrasing. Occasional small issues appear: the repetition of the parenthetical “(aprendizaje en contexto)” after the acronym, the fragment “El ajuste fino.”, and the informal verb “cramar” for “bachoter”. These do not significantly impede understanding, but they reflect minor fluency lapses.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL (aprendizaje en contexto), ventana de contexto. The translation of grounding as “anclado” is slightly unconventional (anclaje would be more typical) but still understandable. Overall terminology use is consistent and appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal, conversational tone suitable for a podcast aimed at a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural adaptation is evident in the choice of everyday expressions, and the dialogue feels native. Small stylistic inconsistencies (e.g., the redundant parenthetical) slightly reduce the polish, but the intent and purpose remain intact.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French transcript are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, anchoring, memory features. No essential content is omitted, and the explanations are concise. The translation occasionally paraphrases for clarity but maintains full meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version is a solid, highly readable, and fluent rendering of the French original.
