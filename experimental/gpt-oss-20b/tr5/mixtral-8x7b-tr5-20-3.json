  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is highly fragmented and interspersed with editorial notes, English fragments, and repeated speaker labels (“Luc: Lucas:”).  These elements break the narrative flow, making it difficult for a reader to follow the conversation.  Even where the translation itself is present, the sentence structures are often choppy and lack logical progression, reducing overall comprehensibility.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many passages contain awkward phrasing and unnatural word choices (e.g., “Lucas:” repeated, “luc: Lucas:”, “Se le olvida todo.” followed by “Ella olvida todo.”).  Punctuation is inconsistent, and some idiomatic expressions are mistranslated or left literal.  The resulting prose sounds stilted to a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms such as *pré-entraînement* → *pre‑entrenamiento* and *grounding* → *anclaje* are generally correct.  However, there is inconsistency: *In‑Context Learning* is sometimes left untranslated, while *memory* is rendered as “Mémoire” rather than “memoria”.  Some specialized concepts are omitted or inadequately explained, reducing clarity for non‑technical readers.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation frequently retains French phrasing or English fragments, which detracts from cultural appropriateness.  While the general intent (“explain how AI learns”) is preserved, the adaptation lacks polish; idiomatic Spanish equivalents are missing in several places, and the overall tone feels more like a literal translation than a natural podcast script.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are either omitted, duplicated, or replaced with unrelated notes.  Key details—such as the distinction between in‑context learning and fine‑tuning—are lost or misrepresented in several sections.  The final transcript therefore fails to convey all essential information present in the source.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a basic grasp of the source material but suffers from significant structural, lexical, and contextual flaws.  The text is confusing and incomplete, and it reads more like a rough draft than a polished final product.  Substantial revision is required to produce a clear, fluent, and accurate Spanish version of the podcast transcript.\n\nOverall score: 7/20 (average of the five criterion scores)."
