  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow and the explanations of complex concepts such as pre‑training and transfer learning are clear. The sentence structure is logical, but a few spots are slightly clunky – for instance “informaciones” instead of “información” and the repeated “Lo olvida todo.” The overall flow, however, remains comprehensible to a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural and smooth, with appropriate contemporary vocabulary. Some expressions feel slightly awkward (e.g., “el sistema busca rápidamente en tus antiguos intercambios las informaciones que parecen pertinentes” could be better phrased). The occasional mixing of English acronyms (ICL) is understandable but could be clarified. Overall, the fluency is high but not perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto, anclaje, grounding. The terminology is consistent and matches the audience’s level of understanding. Minor issues include the untranslated English acronym ICL and the word “informaciones” in plural form.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent – explaining AI learning processes in a podcast format – is preserved. Cultural adaptation is suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience, with a conversational tone that fits the format. No major cultural missteps are present.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French text are present, including the distinctions between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning, as well as the discussion of memory features. No significant omissions, and redundancies are minimal.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid, maintaining the clarity and intent of the original. Minor linguistic refinements would improve fluency and polish, but the core message is faithfully conveyed. This is a competent translation that would serve the target audience well with only slight adjustments needed for perfect naturalness and precision."
