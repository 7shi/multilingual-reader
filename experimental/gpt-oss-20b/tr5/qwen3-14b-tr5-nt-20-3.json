  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Most sentences are logically structured and the complex ideas from the French original are preserved. Minor issues (missing accents, slightly awkward phrasing in a few places) do not prevent comprehension, so the score is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The overall flow feels natural for a Spanish-speaking audience, but some sentences use non‑idiomatic wording such as \"Lo entendiste todo\" or \"Es una artimaña?\". The word choices are mostly contemporary and correct, though a few prepositions or article placements are off. The text still reads smoothly, warranting a solid score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\" (though \"fine‑tuning\" is kept in brackets), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\". Consistency is good, but the occasional untranslated term or misspelling (e.g., \"preentrenamiento\" missing a space) slightly reduces the score.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation preserves the original intent and cultural nuance. Expressions such as the consultant analogy and the comparison with memorizing exams are suitable for Spanish listeners. There is little mistranslation or cultural disconnect, so the score is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French source is present. No significant content was omitted, and the added clarifications (e.g., explaining that memory is temporary) enhance understanding. Only very minor grammatical errors appear, so the completeness rating is very high.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is strong overall, capturing the nuance, tone, and technical detail of the original French script. Minor linguistic imperfections—such as some awkward phrasing, missing accents, or small grammatical slips—do not significantly detract from clarity or naturalness. The translator has successfully preserved the meaning, structure, and conversational style suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience, making it an excellent job with only slight room for polish. The average score reflects this high quality, with a final mark of 18 out of 20. The translation effectively balances fidelity to the source with fluency and accessibility in the target language."
