  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation uses short, clear sentences that most Spanish‑speaking listeners can follow. The speaker’s dialogue is kept in a natural conversational rhythm. However, some metaphorical expressions (e.g. *\"El aprendizaje en contexto es como bachatear\"*) may feel vague or unfamiliar to a general audience, slightly reducing clarity. Overall, the script is easily comprehensible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds largely natural to native Spanish speakers, with appropriate colloquialisms and smooth phrasing. Minor fluency issues include the colloquial verb *bachatear* (which is informal and may not be widely understood), occasional abrupt repetition of phrases like *\"aprendizaje en contexto\"*, and a couple of minor grammatical slips (e.g., missing accents on *ajuste*). These do not significantly hinder understanding, but they slightly detract from the polish expected in a professional podcast script.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *grounding* → *anclaje*. The translator preserves the nuance of *ICL* (In‑Context Learning) and explains it in Spanish. The use of *memoria a corto plazo* and *memoria a largo plazo* is accurate. Only minor variations in wording (e.g., *memoria a corto plazo* vs. *memoria a corto plazo*) appear, but overall terminology is appropriate and understandable for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and conversational tone, adapting cultural references where necessary. The name *Tech Éclair* is preserved, which is appropriate for brand consistency. Phrases like *¡Exactamente!* are common Spanish exclamations, reinforcing the casual, engaging style. The overall adaptation respects Spanish-speaking listeners’ expectations while maintaining the original script’s humor and accessibility.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential points from the French original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, the transient vs permanent memory, and the new memory feature. No critical details were omitted, and the translation stays concise. A few redundancies exist (repeating *aprendizaje en contexto*), but they do not detract from clarity. The script remains complete and faithful to the source content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and largely faithful to the French original. It preserves the conversational style, explains technical concepts, and conveys the intended message effectively. Minor improvements could focus on refining some informal metaphors and tightening repetitive phrasing to elevate the script’s polish. Overall, it provides a clear, natural, and complete version suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience listening to a technology podcast about AI learning processes.  Overall score: 90/100 (≈4.5/5)."
