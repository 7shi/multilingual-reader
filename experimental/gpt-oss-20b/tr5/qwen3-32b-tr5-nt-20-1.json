  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow, with logical sentence structure and clear explanations of complex concepts. Minor readability issues arise from a few missing accents (e.g., “¿Porque”) and slightly repetitive phrasing, but overall readers can understand the content without confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker, but a few awkward expressions (e.g., “Tienes toda la razón” in a formal podcast setting) and the occasional missing accent (e.g., “¿Porque”) reduce naturalness. Punctuation could be tightened in a few places.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered (preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje en contexto, anchoring as anclaje, memoria a corto plazo). Consistency is maintained throughout the dialogue, and explanations are provided where necessary.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references appropriately for Spanish listeners (opening with “Hola”, using conversational tone). Minor improvements could be made in the formal phrasing of “El aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL” to match Spanish academic style.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French transcript are present; no substantive information is omitted, and redundant content is not added. The translation keeps the dialogue concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the original meaning with clear, mostly natural language. Minor corrections—particularly proper use of accents and a few stylistic tweaks—would bring it to perfection. The translator demonstrates good handling of technical terms and cultural adaptation for Spanish-speaking audiences."
