  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, but some sentences are awkwardly constructed or contain missing words, which can momentarily confuse readers. Overall, readers can follow the dialogue, but a few parts require re-reading for clarity.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation shows many natural phrases, but several grammatical errors and unnatural word choices reduce fluency. Phrases like \"la IA no se ajusta constantemente con tus conversaciones\" are ungrammatical, and some repetitions feel stilted. The style is mostly conversational but occasionally awkward.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally well translated: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", \"ventana de contexto\". Minor inconsistencies exist (e.g., mixing \"ajuste fino\" and \"fine‑tuning\"), but overall terminology is appropriate for a general audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator keeps the conversational tone and many of the original analogies, but some cultural nuances are lost or misrepresented. Certain explanatory comments are omitted or simplified, slightly weakening the intended effect. The adaptation is adequate but not fully optimized for Spanish-speaking listeners.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The majority of the original dialogue is preserved, but a few lines are shortened or slightly altered, which could lead to minor information loss. The overall storyline and key explanations remain intact, yet some nuances and repeated clarifications are missing.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core content and maintains the conversational style, but it suffers from occasional grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and minor omissions. With some polishing and careful proof‑reading, the Spanish version could reach a higher level of fluency and completeness. As it stands, it is a solid effort but not yet polished to a professional standard for broadcast‑quality Spanish content. Overall score: 14/20, indicating a good but improvable translation quality. This evaluation considers readability, fluency, terminology usage, contextual adaptation, and completeness of information. The translation is functional but would benefit from editorial refinement to improve naturalness and precision for native Spanish audiences. The scoring reflects the combined impact of these aspects, resulting in a final score of 14 out of 20. This score indicates that the translation is understandable and mostly accurate, yet it still requires improvement in clarity, naturalness, and completeness."
