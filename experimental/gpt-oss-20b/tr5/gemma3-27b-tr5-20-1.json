  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is mostly easy to read. The sentences follow a logical order and most technical concepts are presented in plain language. Minor issues arise in a few phrases that feel slightly literal (e.g., *“Los documentos de información exactos”*), but overall the audience can grasp the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural for a Spanish-speaking audience, maintaining the conversational tone of the original. Occasional awkward wording—such as *“Lo has entendido a la perfección”* or *“el sistema busca rápidamente en tus intercambios anteriores”*—doesn’t impede comprehension, yet a few grammatical adjustments would make it smoother.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most key terms are accurately rendered: *pre-entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL*. However, *grounding* was left in English, which slightly weakens consistency. The rest of the technical vocabulary is correct and appropriately explained where needed.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original's intent and keeps the informal, friendly vibe. Cultural nuances are handled well, though the term *grounding* could have been adapted to *anclaje* for better localization. The adaptation is generally effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All sections of the source text are present, and no substantive meaning is lost. The only small omission is the untranslated *grounding*, but the overall narrative remains intact. Redundancies were not introduced, keeping the text concise.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation delivers a clear, fluent, and mostly accurate rendition of the original French script. Minor terminology inconsistencies and slightly awkward phrasings reduce the score, but the overall quality is strong, making the episode accessible to Spanish‑speaking listeners without compromising technical accuracy or context. With a few fine‑tuning edits—especially translating *grounding* and smoothing a handful of sentences—the translation would reach an excellent level of polish and professionalism. Overall, the translation demonstrates a solid grasp of both language and subject matter, delivering the intended message effectively to the target audience. The total score reflects this balance between near‑flawless communication and the small areas needing improvement, culminating in an overall rating of 16 out of 20 points. This indicates a high‑quality translation that would serve well in a production setting with minimal final edits."
