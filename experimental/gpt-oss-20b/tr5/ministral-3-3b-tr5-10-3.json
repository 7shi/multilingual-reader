    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely intelligible and follows a logical sentence structure.  Some passages are a little choppy (e.g., “El afinado. Es como enviar…”) and the use of plural “informaciones” is odd, but overall readers can follow the narrative without major confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a few awkward expressions and grammatical slips: “El afinado” instead of “el afinamiento” or “el ajuste fino”, the phrase “El aprendizaje en contexto es como el bachotaje: las informaciones que” should use singular “información”, and the mix of informal exclamation marks.  These issues slightly detract from a smooth read for native speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved (“preentrenamiento”, “in‑context learning”, “grounding”).  However, the translation of “fine‑tuning” as “El afinado” is non‑standard; “ajuste fino” or “afinado” would be clearer.  Some terms (e.g., “memoria”) are translated correctly but lack the nuance of “memory” in the original context.  Consistency is decent, but the chosen terms could be more conventional.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator retains the podcast’s informal tone and uses culturally familiar analogies (e.g., “joven recién egresado”), which helps the target audience.  The title inconsistency (“Tech Flash” vs. “Tech Éclair”) is a minor but notable oversight.  Otherwise, the adaptation respects the original intent and is appropriate for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original appear in the Spanish version.  Minor details (the exact phrasing of “El afinado”) are slightly altered but not omitted.  The translation avoids unnecessary repetition while maintaining clarity.  No essential content is missing.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original message clearly and is largely fluent.  Some terminology and grammatical choices could be refined, and a small inconsistency in the show’s title stands out.  With minor edits, the Spanish version would be a polished and faithful rendition of the French source."
