  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable to a native audience; the dialogue format is preserved and most sentences are logically structured. However, several punctuation and preposition errors (e.g., \"parte de un contexto vacío\" missing the preposition) and gender‑pronoun mismatches (“los” referring to *conocimiento*) slightly hinder clarity. Overall, readers can follow the conversation but might pause to clarify minor ambiguities.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly in many parts, but it contains noticeable unnatural expressions and typographical artifacts such as stray asterisks (**). Phrases like \"la IA los usa para esta única conversación\" and \"truco de contexto\" feel awkward. Additionally, the frequent repetition of speaker labels with inconsistent formatting disrupts the flow. These issues lower the naturalness of the prose.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly correctly rendered: *pre-entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *In‑Context Learning* (aprendizaje en contexto), *grounding* (anclaje). The abbreviation ICL is maintained. Minor issues include the use of \"prompt\" without a Spanish equivalent and the slightly off gender in \"los\" referring to *conocimiento*. Nevertheless, terminology consistency is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the conversational tone and references that resonate with Spanish‑speaking listeners. Cultural adaptation is adequate; no culturally inappropriate expressions appear. However, some colloquial choices (e.g., \"consultor brillante\") could be smoother. The overall intent is preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL, memory features, and the analogy of a temporary consultant. Minor omissions include the exact phrase \"une mémoire\" translated simply as \"memoria\" without further explanation, but this does not affect comprehension. Redundancies are minimal.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation delivers the core ideas effectively and is largely coherent. However, it suffers from several formatting errors, occasional grammatical awkwardness, and minor pronoun mismatches that detract from its polish. With a few revisions—removing stray markup, correcting pronoun agreement, and smoothing some idiomatic choices—the text would achieve a higher level of fluency and professionalism. Overall, it is a solid translation that would serve well for a general audience but would benefit from careful proofreading before publication or broadcast use. "
