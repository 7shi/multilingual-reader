  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the clear, step‑by‑step explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning that is present in the original French. Sentence structure is mostly logical and easy to follow, and the translator explains technical concepts (e.g., \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\") in a way that Spanish‑speaking listeners can understand. Minor phrasing could be simplified further, but overall readability is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker. Most idiomatic expressions are appropriate and the vocabulary is contemporary. A few minor issues exist: \"le proporcionas la información necesaria\" is a bit formal but acceptable; some longer sentences feel slightly clipped, but the overall flow is natural.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"in‑context learning (ICL)\" are correctly rendered. The translator consistently uses Spanish equivalents. Where terms may be unfamiliar (e.g., ICL), the translator retains the English abbreviation in parentheses, which helps clarity for a professional audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and tone, maintaining the conversational podcast style. Cultural references are minimal and the Spanish phrasing aligns with Spanish‑speaking listeners’ expectations. No major cultural mismatches or awkward adaptations are present.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. The translator does not omit any substantive points, and the content remains concise and clear. No redundant or missing content is detected.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality. It maintains the clarity, technical accuracy, and conversational tone of the original French text while using natural Spanish expressions. Minor refinements could improve flow, but the translation effectively conveys all necessary information to a Spanish‑speaking audience, making it suitable for a professional podcast transcript."
