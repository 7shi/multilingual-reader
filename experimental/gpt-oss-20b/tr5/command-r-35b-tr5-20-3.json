  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version maintains the conversational flow of the original. Sentences are generally short, and technical concepts are explained in a way that a native Spanish speaker can follow. Some phrases are slightly literal (“Imaginad que enviamos…”) but still clear. Minor awkwardness appears in a few compound sentences, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly and uses contemporary vocabulary. A few expressions are slightly formal or literal – e.g., “re‑aprender” with a hyphen and the repeated use of “¡Exactamente!” – but these do not impede understanding. Overall the text sounds natural for a Spanish-speaking audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "All key technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje (grounding), ventana de contexto, memoria. The translation consistently uses the same terms throughout, and when a term has a more common Spanish equivalent (e.g., “afinado” for fine‑tuning), it is used appropriately. Minor style choice: “afinado” could also be “ajuste fino,” but the chosen term is acceptable.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue is adapted to Spanish idiom and cultural expectations, using colloquial interjections (“¡Exactamente!”) and conversational phrasing. The script retains the original intent and tone; however, some subtle cultural tailoring could improve relatability (e.g., using “imagine” instead of “imaginen”). Overall, contextual adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No substantive information from the French original is omitted. The translation faithfully reproduces the dialogue, including technical explanations and examples. Minor redundancies are preserved in line with the source, but no essential content is lost.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality. It preserves the clarity, technical accuracy, and conversational tone of the original while remaining understandable to native Spanish speakers. Small stylistic refinements could raise the score further, but the text is largely fluent and faithful."
