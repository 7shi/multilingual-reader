  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation generally follows a clear, logical sentence structure, making the content understandable for native speakers. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained with sufficient context. However, some sentences are a bit stiff or repetitive (e.g., *“Lo has entendido perfectamente”*), and the use of *“imaginen”* could be smoother. Overall, readability is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most places, but a few expressions feel slightly awkward or literal. Phrases like *“Lo olvida todo”* and *“le damos una guía rápida”* could be refined for idiomatic flow. The punctuation is generally correct, though occasional repetition of *“Lo has entendido perfectamente”* reduces fluidity. The vocabulary choice is appropriate, yet a few syntactic adjustments would enhance smoothness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly translated and consistently used: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *in‑context learning*, *grounding* (as *ancaje*), and *memoria*. The translator keeps the meaning intact and provides brief explanations where needed, ensuring that the target audience can grasp the concepts. Terminology handling is excellent.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent of the original French script is preserved: the dialogue remains informal and conversational, mirroring a podcast format. Cultural nuances for a Spanish‑speaking audience are respected, and idiomatic expressions such as *“se abre una nueva ventana”* fit the context. No cultural misinterpretations are evident, and the adaptation effectively conveys the original message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version captures all major points from the French original, including the distinctions between pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the new memory features. Minor paraphrasing occurs, but no essential information is omitted. Some redundancy is present, but overall the content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid, faithfully rendering the technical explanations and maintaining the conversational tone of the podcast. While it could benefit from minor fluency improvements and smoother phrasing, it meets the criteria for readability, terminology, contextual adaptation, and completeness. The main areas for enhancement are naturalness and eliminating occasional repetition, which would elevate the translation to a higher standard."
