  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to read and follows the logical flow of the original. Sentences are short, the use of everyday language helps comprehension, and technical concepts are explained in a clear way. Minor issues (e.g., \"la IA no se afina constantemente con tus conversaciones\") are understandable but slightly awkward. Overall, the readability is very good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for native Spanish speakers. Most expressions are natural and the vocabulary is contemporary. A few phrases feel slightly literal or awkward: \"la IA no se afina constantemente con tus conversaciones\" and the repetition of \"se apoya en bases extremadamente sólidas\" could be phrased more fluidly. Nevertheless, the overall fluency is strong.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, anclaje. The Spanish equivalents are correct for a general audience. There is no misuse of terminology, and the terms are presented in the context of the discussion. Minor improvement could be made by explicitly defining ICL when it first appears, but it is generally clear from context.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the tone and informal conversational style of the podcast. Cultural references are minimal and adapted appropriately. The Spanish version remains faithful to the original intent and conveys the same message without unnecessary localization. The adaptation is suitable for Spanish‑speaking audiences and maintains the original's engaging style.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, context‑learning (ICL), grounding, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of the memory feature. No essential information is omitted, and the translation avoids unnecessary repetition while staying concise and clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, accurately conveying the original content while maintaining natural flow and appropriate terminology. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve fluency, but overall it is clear, faithful, and well adapted for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The translation successfully preserves the engaging, explanatory tone of the podcast script, making it accessible to the target readers without losing any nuance from the source text."
