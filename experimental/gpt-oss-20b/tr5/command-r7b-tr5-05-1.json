  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, but several errors and awkward phrasings (e.g., “Précisément.”, missing accents, duplicated speaker labels) interrupt the flow. Sentences are mostly clear, yet the presence of French words and inconsistent punctuation hampers smooth reading for a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several literal and unnatural expressions, such as keeping the French word “ancrage”, repeating speaker tags (“Luc: Luc:”), and using an overly literal rendering of phrases (“se le proporcionó una información anticipada”). These make the text feel stilted and less natural for a native audience.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most key technical terms are correctly translated (“preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”). However, some terms are either left untranslated or misused (e.g., “grounding” remains “ancrage”), and there is no consistent use of hyphens where common (pre‑entrenamiento). Overall terminology is adequate but not consistently precise.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and conversational tone of the original are preserved, but the translation occasionally retains French syntax and expressions that are not idiomatic in Spanish. Minor cultural adjustments are missing, such as adapting idiomatic expressions for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The adaptation is functional but not fully polished.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the main points from the original are present, and the conversation structure is maintained. Minor omissions are not evident, though the duplication of speaker labels could be seen as a form of redundancy rather than omission.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation succeeds in conveying the core message and most of the technical details, but it falls short in naturalness and precision. Key errors—such as unconverted French words, repeated speaker tags, and awkward phrasing—reduce readability and fluency. A more careful editing pass, attention to Spanish idioms, and consistent terminology handling would significantly improve the quality. Overall, the work is serviceable but needs refinement before it can be considered polished and professional for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
