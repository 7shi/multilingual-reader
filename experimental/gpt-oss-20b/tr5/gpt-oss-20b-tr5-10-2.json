  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow and the sentence structure is generally logical. Long sentences are well punctuated, and the explanation of complex ideas (e.g., pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL) is clear. Minor readability issues arise from a few slightly awkward word choices but overall the text is comprehensible to a native audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural; idiomatic expressions and contemporary vocabulary are used appropriately. Some expressions feel a bit literal, e.g., \"se apoya en fundamentos extremadamente sólidos\" and \"la IA no ha «olvidado» en el sentido humano\". These do not impede understanding but reduce the smoothness of the prose. Overall fluency is high but not perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje\". The translator occasionally explains the concepts (e.g., why fine‑tuning is like a specialization), which aids comprehension. There are no major terminology errors.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation retains the original tone and conversational style while using Spanish cultural references (e.g., \"consultor brillante\"). The translation preserves the intent and humor of the French script. Minor adjustments could enhance localisation (e.g., using \"ventana de chat\" instead of \"ventana de contexto\"), but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French original is present. No significant omissions or additions that change meaning. Redundancy is avoided, and the translation remains concise while staying faithful to the source.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is a strong, faithful rendering of the French source. It captures the technical concepts and the conversational rhythm of the original podcast. Minor fluency tweaks would elevate the text to a fully natural level, but as it stands, it meets high standards of clarity, terminology accuracy, and contextual fidelity."
