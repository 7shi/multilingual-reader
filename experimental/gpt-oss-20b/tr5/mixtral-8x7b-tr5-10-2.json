  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is fragmented and lacks coherence. Sentences are incomplete or improperly punctuated, making it hard for a native Spanish speaker to follow the flow of the dialogue. While some isolated phrases are understandable, the overall structure fails to present a clear, logical narrative. Therefore, readability is low.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The language is highly disjointed, with many grammatical errors and unnatural phrasing. Phrases such as \"¡Hasta pronto para el próximo episodio de 'Tech Éclair'\" are correct, but the surrounding text contains awkward word order, missing articles, and inconsistent verb forms. The translation does not sound natural or smooth to a native speaker.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Some technical terms (e.g., \"apprentissage en contexte\", \"mémoire\", \"pré-entraînement\") are either omitted or incorrectly rendered. The translation does not consistently use the appropriate Spanish equivalents for AI terminology, and several key concepts from the original are missing or mistranslated. This inconsistency undermines the technical accuracy.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to convey the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural nuances such as the friendly yet formal register of a tech podcast are largely absent, and the translation lacks contextual explanations that would aid comprehension for the target audience.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "A significant portion of the original dialogue is omitted or fragmented in the translation. Key explanations about pre-training, fine-tuning, and in-context learning are either missing or incompletely presented, leading to an incomplete picture of the subject matter.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is markedly incomplete and lacks the clarity, fluency, and technical precision required for a faithful rendition of the original French transcript. While a few phrases are correct, the overall text fails to convey the intended meaning and structure, making it unsuitable for a target audience seeking a clear understanding of AI concepts in a podcast setting. Significant revision and expansion are needed to meet basic quality standards for professional translation."
