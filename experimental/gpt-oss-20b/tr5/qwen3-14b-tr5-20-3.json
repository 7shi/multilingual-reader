  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally easy to follow and the dialogue flow remains clear. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., missing question marks, incorrect plural forms) slightly interrupt readability but do not render the text incomprehensible.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The overall tone is natural for a Spanish-speaking audience. However, a few phrases feel literal or awkward—such as “informaciones que parece relevantes” and the repetition in “Eso es exactamente eso.” These reduce smoothness, but the majority of sentences read fluently.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly translated (pre-entrenamiento, afinación, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto). Minor inconsistencies appear (e.g., “informaciones” vs. “informaciones”), and a grammatical error (“Las nuevas conocimientos”). Nevertheless, terminology is largely accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the conversational style and adapts cultural references appropriately. The narrative intent is maintained, but some expressions (e.g., “aprenderá el francés a una velocidad increíble”) could be more idiomatic.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French text are present; no substantive content is omitted. Minor editorial adjustments would improve conciseness, but the information remains complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original meaning accurately and reads well for a Spanish audience. A few grammatical and stylistic refinements would elevate the quality, but overall it is a strong, faithful rendition suitable for a podcast audience. Minor issues with punctuation and a few awkward phrasing should be addressed in a final polish."
