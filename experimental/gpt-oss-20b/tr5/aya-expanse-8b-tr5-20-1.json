  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish transcript is largely understandable for native speakers. The sentence structure follows the original closely, and key concepts are clearly explained. However, occasional long, compound sentences (e.g., the duplicated paragraph explaining the \"memory\" feature) create a bit of clutter and may confuse readers. Minor punctuation errors and missing line breaks also slightly impede flow.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions feel forced or non‑idiomatic: \"Se puede afirmar\", \"Se puede decir que…\", and the repeated block of text. Some words such as \"afinación\" for \"fine‑tuning\" are acceptable but less common; more typical would be \"ajuste fino\". The overall rhythm is disrupted by the duplication and by switching between formal and informal register. Consequently, the translation sounds somewhat mechanical rather than natural.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly correct: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\". Consistency is good, though \"fine‑tuning\" is rendered as \"afinación\" instead of the more common \"ajuste fino\". The word \"memory\" as \"memoria\" is fine, but the translation of the feature could benefit from a clearer description. Overall, terminology is appropriate and largely consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and maintains cultural relevance. The opening greeting and the casual conversational style suit a podcast audience. However, some cultural nuances are missed: for instance, the explanation of the \"memory\" feature is duplicated, which could confuse listeners. No major cultural missteps, but slight improvements could be made for clarity.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script appear in the Spanish version. The dialogue flows, and no essential content is omitted. The duplicated paragraph introduces redundancy rather than missing information. The translation is concise yet thorough, with no noticeable gaps.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a good grasp of the source material and retains most of the original meaning. However, it suffers from stylistic issues—especially repetitive wording and some awkward phrasing—that reduce its naturalness. Addressing these points would elevate the quality and make the transcript more engaging for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Overall, it is a solid, though imperfect, rendering of the podcast script. 14/20 overall, with most of the room for improvement lying in fluency and eliminating duplicated content to enhance readability and coherence."
