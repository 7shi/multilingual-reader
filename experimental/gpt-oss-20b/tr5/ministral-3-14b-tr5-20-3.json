  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the conversational flow of the original podcast script. Sentences are generally short, and complex ideas such as pre‑training and in‑context learning are introduced with explanatory remarks that aid understanding. However, a few phrases (e.g., *“descubrimos”* in the opening line) feel slightly formal for a casual podcast, which marginally lowers the overall readability.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic quirks appear: *“descubrimos”* instead of *“descubriremos”*, *“una memoria a corto plazo”* instead of *“memoria de corto plazo”*. Vocabulary choices are contemporary and appropriate, and there are no major grammatical errors. These small deviations prevent a perfect fluency score.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *ICL*, *anclaje*. Explanatory phrases accompany terms where necessary, making them accessible to non‑experts. No significant mistranslations or omissions occur. The terminology handling is therefore very good.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the informal, conversational tone of the original. Cultural references are neutral and the Spanish version does not introduce foreign idioms that would confuse readers. Minor linguistic choices could be further localized (e.g., using *“tus”* instead of *“vuestras”*), but overall the adaptation effectively conveys the intended message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the original French script is present in the Spanish translation. No essential information is omitted, and redundant sections are not added. The translation is concise while retaining clarity, and supplementary explanations are provided only where the technical concepts might be unclear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, successfully capturing the original's tone, meaning, and technical detail. Minor stylistic and phrasing adjustments would raise the fluency slightly, but overall the text is clear, accurate, and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts. The translation demonstrates strong proficiency in both language and subject matter, making it a reliable rendition of the source material for podcast listeners or readers."
