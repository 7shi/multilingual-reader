    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and logical. The sentence structure follows the original fairly well, and complex ideas (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL) are explained in a way that a native Spanish speaker can understand without excessive difficulty. Minor interruptions occur only in a few longer sentences, but overall the text remains comprehensible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most of the translation reads smoothly, there are several spots where the phrasing feels slightly unnatural. For example, \"ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\" repeats the term, and \"Lenguaje de Comprensión e Interpretación\" is not a standard translation of ICL. The word \"apunte\" is acceptable but feels informal compared to the context. These small awkwardities lower the overall naturalness, but they do not severely impede understanding.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"ajuste fino\" for fine‑tuning, \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\" for grounding, etc. The occasional mistranslation of ICL to \"Lenguaje de Comprensión e Interpretación\" is a notable slip, but otherwise the terminology remains consistent and appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and purpose intact. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is straightforward. The occasional phrase \"el modelo en sí no aprende\" is a literal but acceptable translation. The name of the podcast is preserved, which is appropriate. Overall, contextual adaptation is good with minor style adjustments needed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French text are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No major content was omitted. Minor redundancy exists in the ICL definition, but it does not detract from clarity. The translation remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the core ideas accurately and is largely readable, but a few lexical choices and repetitions reduce its naturalness and introduce small inaccuracies. With minor revisions—especially correcting the ICL wording and smoothing a few phrases—the translation would reach a higher standard of fluency and precision. Nonetheless, it is a solid rendition suitable for a general audience familiar with AI concepts. 16/20 overall (average of the individual scores)."
