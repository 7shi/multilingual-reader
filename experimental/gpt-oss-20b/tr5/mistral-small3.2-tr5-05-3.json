    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable for native speakers. Sentence structures are mostly correct and the dialogue flows logically. However, a few lines contain clunky wording or extraneous words that slightly hinder clarity (e.g., \"la IA, o ventana de contexto\" repeats the subject unnecessarily). Nonetheless, the general comprehension remains high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but there are a handful of awkward expressions such as \"El aprendizaje en contexto es como empollar\" and the use of the noun \"afinado\" instead of the more idiomatic \"afinamiento\". The occasional untranslated English term \"prompt\" is acceptable in technical contexts, but its presence can feel jarring to some readers. Overall fluency is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms (preentrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje, memoria, ICL) are correctly rendered. Minor inconsistencies exist, notably the use of \"afinado\" for fine‑tuning, which is less common than \"afinamiento\". Terminology remains understandable and largely consistent throughout the text.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation remains faithful to the original intent but leans heavily on literal rendering, leading to some culturally incongruous or overly literal phrasing. For instance, \"empollar\" is a colloquial verb that may not resonate with all Spanish‑speaking audiences, and the repetition of \"la IA\" in a single sentence feels redundant. Adapting idiomatic expressions could improve the adaptation.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No essential information is omitted, and the dialogue order is preserved. Minor details (e.g., the phrase \"in short, it's an automated context‑learning trick\") are adequately conveyed. The translation is concise and clear, with no unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers the core content accurately and is mostly readable and fluent for native Spanish speakers. It preserves technical terms and maintains the conversational flow. However, certain phrasings feel literal or slightly awkward, and a few terminology choices could be refined for better naturalness. Overall, the quality is solid but could benefit from a more idiomatic polish and consistency in technical vocabulary usage. The translation would serve well in a general audience context, though a professional copyeditor could raise it to a higher standard by addressing the highlighted issues. Overall score: 15/20."
