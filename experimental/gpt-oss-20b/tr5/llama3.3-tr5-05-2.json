  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are well‑structured and the flow mirrors the original, though a few minor punctuation choices (e.g., an unnecessary comma after “contexto”) slightly affect readability. Overall, native readers can understand the content with little effort.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most phrasing sounds natural for Spanish speakers, especially in a tech podcast context. The use of “prompt” is acceptable in this genre, though some sentences could be smoother (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto, es como estudiar para un examen” would read better without the comma). Minor stylistic quirks exist, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are translated accurately (“preentrenamiento”, “afinado”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”). The abbreviation ICL is kept consistent, and the explanations of concepts are faithful to the source. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary. Minor inconsistencies with the term “prompt” could be addressed, but overall terminology is sound.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references are neutral and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Some idiomatic expressions could be polished (e.g., “Lo has entendido todo” is fine, but a more idiomatic phrase might improve feel), yet the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is present, with no omissions or additions that distort meaning. The explanatory parts are retained verbatim. The translation is concise, and redundancy is minimal. Thus the content is complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is accurate, clear, and largely faithful to the original. Minor improvements in punctuation and a few more natural phrasings would elevate it to near‑perfect quality, but as it stands, it serves its purpose well for a native audience in a tech‑focused podcast context. Overall, a solid job with a few small refinements needed for peak naturalness and polish. 18/20"
