  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely comprehensible to native readers. Sentences are generally short and the dialogue structure is preserved, which helps follow the conversation. However, some technical explanations are too literal and occasionally obscure the intended meaning, making a few sections harder to grasp on first read. The overall clarity is good but could be improved with more natural phrasing and clearer explanations of key concepts.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text has a number of awkward expressions and minor grammatical errors (e.g., “la IA ‘se recuerda’ de esta información”, “se inserta automáticamente estos fragmentos”, “la IA no ‘olvida’ en el sentido humano”). Vocabulary choices are generally appropriate, but some terms are literally translated from French (“affinamiento” instead of “ajuste fino”) which can sound unnatural. The overall flow is acceptable but not smooth enough for a native audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is sometimes translated correctly (e.g., “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”), but other key terms are mishandled: “pré-entrenamiento” is kept as is, “affinamiento” is used inconsistently, and “ancrage” was left untranslated. Consistency is lacking, and some terms are not fully explained for a lay audience. This weakens the professional tone of the transcript.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent of the podcast is preserved, and the local flavor is mostly retained (e.g., changing the show title). Nevertheless, some cultural references remain too literal or ambiguous, and the translation fails to fully adapt idiomatic expressions to Spanish-speaking listeners. Minor improvements in localization would enhance relatability.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No major content is omitted; the dialogue covers all points of the original. However, the translation introduces some redundancies (e.g., repeated emphasis on “la IA no ‘olvida’”), and the explanatory notes are sometimes less detailed than the French source. Overall, the information remains intact.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material and preserves the dialogue structure, but it suffers from several issues: awkward phrasing, inconsistent terminology, and a lack of natural flow. These problems reduce readability and fluency, especially for native Spanish speakers. With careful revision of technical terms, smoother sentence construction, and better contextual adaptation, the text could reach a professional quality suitable for a broadcast audience."
