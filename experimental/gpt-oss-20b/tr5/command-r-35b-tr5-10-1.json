  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to follow and the logical flow of the dialogue is preserved. Minor ambiguities appear in a few sentences (e.g., “una nueva inteligencia artificial completamente virgen” feels a little informal), but overall readers can understand the concepts without struggle.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text mostly sounds natural to native Spanish speakers. Some phrases are slightly awkward or contain grammatical quirks (“en realidad le han proporcionado un apunte justo antes de empezar a hablar contigo” could be smoother). There are also a couple of mis‑used words (e.g., “apunte” instead of “apunte(s)”). These do not severely hinder comprehension, so fluency is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: *preentrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *transfer learning*, *in‑context learning* (aprendizaje en contexto). The translation keeps the English acronyms where appropriate (ICL). Terminology is consistent and suitable for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally adapts the original context well, but there is an inconsistency with the brand name: the opening uses \"Tech Flash\" while the closing references \"Tech Éclair\". This inconsistency could confuse listeners. Aside from that, cultural references are appropriately handled.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points of the original are retained. No significant content is omitted, and the translation keeps the dialogue structure intact. Slight redundancies (e.g., repeated explanations of context window) remain but do not detract from overall clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is overall strong, conveying the meaning and nuance of the French original. Minor issues—such as brand name inconsistency and occasional awkward phrasing—prevent it from achieving perfect fluency, but the core concepts and technical terminology are handled accurately and understandably for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
