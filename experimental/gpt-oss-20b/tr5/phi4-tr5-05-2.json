    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version largely preserves the logical flow of the original French script. Sentences are generally easy to follow and complex concepts are explained with enough context. However, a few long sentences and slightly awkward phrasing (e.g., “Cuando abres una nueva ventana de discusión…”) can momentarily disrupt readability. Overall, the script remains comprehensible for a native Spanish speaker at the target audience level.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is fluent for the most part and uses contemporary vocabulary. Some expressions feel slightly formal or unnatural, such as “una forma astucia de aprendizaje contextual automatizado” instead of the more natural “una forma astuta de aprendizaje contextual automatizado”. Additionally, the use of “AIC” instead of the widely accepted “ICL” (or simply “aprendizaje en contexto”) can sound odd. These small issues lower the overall fluency slightly, but the text still reads smoothly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as pre‑entrenamiento, afinaje, aprendizaje por transferencia, y ventana de contexto are correctly translated and consistently used. The only notable error is the introduction of “AIC (Aprendizaje en Contexto)” – the original abbreviation is ICL, and using a different acronym may confuse readers. Apart from that, the terminology is accurate and appropriate for the audience’s understanding.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation effectively conveys the original intent and purpose of the podcast script. Cultural references are adapted appropriately; for example, the metaphor of a “consultor brillante” resonates with Spanish‑speaking audiences. Minor phrasing choices could be further optimized, but overall the context adaptation is solid and the dialogue feels natural in the target language.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present in the Spanish version. There is no significant omission of content, and the translation keeps the conversation concise while maintaining clarity. Minor repetitions (e.g., the explanation of memory as temporary) mirror the original structure and are intentional for emphasis. Thus, the information completeness is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is well‑crafted and faithful to the original French script. While there are a few minor issues with terminology and occasional phrasing that could be smoothed out, the overall quality is strong. The dialogue flows naturally, technical terms are appropriately handled, and the core message remains clear and engaging for the target audience. A few tweaks—especially replacing ‘AIC’ with the familiar ‘ICL’ and polishing a handful of awkward expressions—would elevate the translation to near‑perfect status. Overall, it provides an accurate, readable, and fluent adaptation of the original content, suitable for broadcast or publication in a Spanish‑speaking podcast context."
