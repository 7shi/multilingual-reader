  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version keeps the dialogue structure and explains the key ideas in a fairly clear manner. Some sentences are a little literal, which can slightly hinder flow for a native listener (e.g., *\"Imaginen que enviamos una IA completamente nueva a la escuela…\"*), but overall the text is easy to understand.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural. However, a few phrases are slightly clunky or literal, such as *\"la IA no ha 'olvidado' en el sentido humano de la palabra; simplemente se ha vaciado su espacio de trabajo temporal\"* and *\"Cuando abres una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío\"*. Minor stylistic tweaks would make it smoother, but it is still quite fluent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled appropriately: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino* (with the English term in parentheses), *aprendizaje en contexto* for ICL, and *anclaje* for grounding. The terminology is consistent throughout the transcript, and the audience is likely to understand these terms. No significant mistranslations or omissions were detected.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the conversational tone of the original podcast, preserves the back‑and‑forth dynamic, and retains the cultural references. Minor improvements could be made to idiomatic Spanish expressions, but the overall intent and purpose are effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the translation does not add unnecessary information. The dialogue remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is highly faithful and largely natural. It preserves the original structure, terminology, and intent, with only a few slightly literal phrasing issues that do not impede comprehension. A few stylistic refinements could improve fluency, but overall it is a strong translation suitable for a native Spanish-speaking audience interested in AI concepts.\n\nAverage Score: 18/20"
