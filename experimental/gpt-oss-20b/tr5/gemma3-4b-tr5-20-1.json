  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, with clear sentence structure and logical flow. Long sentences occasionally clutter the prose, but overall readers can follow the dialogue without difficulty. Minor issues such as the use of “bachorear” (instead of “bachotaje”) slightly impede comprehension, but the overall readability remains high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural to a native Spanish speaker, but some phrases feel slightly awkward or literal. For example, “en secreto” to describe the prompt insertion is uncommon, and “La IA se está afinando” could be more idiomatic. The punctuation and capitalization are generally correct, yet the overall flow is smooth enough for conversational context.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved: pre-entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding. Consistency is good; however, the translation mistakenly uses “bachorear” for the concept of “bachotage,” which is a minor slip. The terminology aligns with contemporary Spanish NLP usage.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the informal, conversational tone suitable for a podcast. Cultural references are mostly preserved, though the “bachorear” slip and the literal “en secreto” could feel less natural. The adaptation effectively conveys the original intent but could improve idiomatic expression for a Spanish audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No critical content is omitted, and the dialogue’s structure is maintained. Some explanations are slightly shortened but remain clear, preserving conciseness without sacrificing meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality overall, effectively capturing the conversational style and technical content of the original. Minor linguistic and terminology tweaks would raise the text to near-perfect fluency and naturalness for native Spanish speakers. Overall, it provides a coherent, readable, and technically accurate rendition suitable for a Spanish-speaking podcast audience. The small issues noted do not detract significantly from the overall usefulness of the translation, but refining them would improve the listening experience."
