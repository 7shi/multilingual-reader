    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable to a native audience and the main ideas are conveyed. However, several sentences contain awkward wording, missing punctuation, and literal translations that disrupt the flow (e.g., “La diferencia entre bachoter pour un examen…”, “aprenderá el francés a una velocidad increíble”). These issues lower the overall readability score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation often reads like a literal word‑for‑word conversion. Unnatural phrasing (mixing French words such as “bachoter” with Spanish), incorrect plural agreement (“la información que se le da en el prompt son temporales”), and a few grammatical slips make the text feel stilted. Naturalness could be improved with smoother sentence structures and more idiomatic Spanish.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms are mostly translated correctly: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL. Nevertheless, the abbreviation “AIC” is incorrectly used instead of “ICL”, and “grounding” is rendered simply as “anclaje” without clarifying its meaning. Minor errors like “bachoter” instead of “estudiar intensamente” slightly compromise technical precision. Overall, terminology handling is adequate but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator retains the conversational tone and references to cultural concepts (e.g., university graduate, consultant). Yet some expressions (e.g., “aprenderá el francés a una velocidad increíble”) feel too literal, and the inserted English/ French fragments (“Translation:”) disrupt the Spanish context. The adaptation is acceptable but could benefit from more idiomatic expressions tailored to Spanish‑speaking audiences.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most content from the original is present, including the discussion of pretraining, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, and memory features. However, a few lines are truncated or mis‑rendered (the “bachoter” sentence, the sudden “Translation:” notes). Despite these minor omissions, the essential information is largely preserved, making the translation largely complete.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation successfully conveys the main ideas of the original French dialogue, but it suffers from several linguistic inaccuracies, awkward phrasing, and occasional misuse of terminology. With some refinements—especially around natural sentence flow, consistency in technical terms, and removal of stray fragments—the translation could reach a high standard of quality. As it stands, it is functional but not polished, reflecting a moderate level of proficiency in the target language while still needing significant editing for fluency and precision. Overall, the translation is acceptable for general comprehension but falls short of a near‑native, fully polished version. The score reflects this balanced assessment: the translation is good but clearly has room for improvement.\n\nThis evaluation considers readability, fluency, terminology accuracy, contextual adaptation, and information completeness, assigning each a 0‑20 score. The overall score is the average of these five scores, yielding a final score of 14 out of 20, which indicates a solid but imperfect translation.\n\nThe key points for improvement are: (1) correcting literal and awkward phrasing; (2) ensuring consistent and accurate terminology (e.g., using ICL instead of AIC, translating “grounding” with a brief explanation); (3) eliminating stray French/English fragments; and (4) polishing grammar and punctuation for smoother reading.\n\nWith these adjustments, the translation would better meet the expectations of native Spanish speakers and accurately reflect the nuanced concepts discussed in the original French text.\n\n**Detailed reasoning for each criterion:**\n- **Readability**: The Spanish sentences are mostly intelligible, but literal word‑for‑word translations (e.g., “bachoter”) and missing punctuation hinder ease of reading.\n- **Fluency**: The text contains several non‑native constructions and grammatical errors that interrupt the flow.\n- **Terminology**: Core technical terms are largely correct, yet inconsistencies (AIC vs ICL) and missing explanations reduce precision.\n- **Contextual adaptation**: The conversational tone is retained, but some expressions feel too literal, and extraneous fragments disrupt cultural appropriateness.\n- **Information completeness**: The bulk of the original content is present; however, a few sentences are awkwardly rendered or truncated, slightly reducing completeness.\n\nOverall, the translation is functional but would benefit from a more careful post‑editing pass to enhance clarity, fluency, and terminological accuracy."
