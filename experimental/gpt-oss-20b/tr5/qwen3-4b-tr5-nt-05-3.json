  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is riddled with meta‑commentary blocks (e.g., \"Luc: 1. Vocabulaire clé…\") that interrupt the natural flow of the dialogue. This makes it difficult for readers to follow the conversation and understand the technical explanations. While the core information is present, the excessive commentary and fragmented sentences severely reduce comprehensibility.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation contains many awkward constructions and literal repetitions of French phrasing (e.g., \"se ha convertido en un especialista\", \"in-context learning\" retained as English acronyms). The style is uneven, with some sentences sounding natural but others feeling stilted or broken. Overall, the fluency is below acceptable standards for native Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pré‑entraînement\", \"fine‑tuning\" and \"ICL\" are translated or kept as is, but the consistency is poor—sometimes French, sometimes English, sometimes a literal Spanish translation. Explanations for terms are missing, and the mix of languages can confuse readers unfamiliar with the original terminology. A more uniform, Spanish‑centric terminology would improve clarity.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely preserves the original wording without adapting idiomatic expressions or cultural references that would resonate with a Spanish‑speaking audience. The inserted meta‑commentary sections also detract from the intended informal yet professional tone of the podcast. Thus, contextual adaptation is weak.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major dialogue lines from the original are present, but the added commentary duplicates content and sometimes obscures key points. While nothing critical is omitted, the extra material increases redundancy and reduces clarity, making the translation less concise.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a literal, word‑for‑word approach with numerous interspersed commentary notes that break the narrative flow. It fails to achieve naturalness, readability, and proper contextual adaptation. A comprehensive rewrite focusing on smooth, culturally adapted Spanish and removing extraneous commentary would be necessary for a publishable result. The translation is suitable only as a draft for further editing, not for direct use in a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience.\n\nOverall score: 6/20 (average across criteria)."
