  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version largely preserves the dialogue structure and follows a logical flow.  However, several lines contain unnecessary repetitions (“Luc: **Luc:** Precisamente.”), missing punctuation, and occasional awkward phrasing that can momentarily confuse the reader.  Overall, readers can understand the content but some minor edits would improve clarity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences read smoothly, but there are a few unnatural expressions and typographical errors (“Luc: Precisely.” left in English, missing accents, inconsistent use of quotation marks).  The overall tone is conversational but not as polished as it could be for a native audience.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: *pré-entraînement* → *pre-entrenamiento*, *affinage* → *afinamiento*, *grounding* → *anclaje*, *ICL* → *In‑Context Learning*.  Consistency is good, though the word “afinamiento” is occasionally followed by “fine‑tuning” in parentheses, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the English term.  The translation provides adequate explanations for most specialized concepts.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the intent and purpose of the original French text.  Cultural adaptation is adequate for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but some expressions remain quite literal (e.g., “solo le hemos proporcionado un truco de contexto”), which could be phrased more naturally.  No major cultural misunderstandings are present.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, memory‑like features, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge.  Minor redundancies (duplicate lines) do not obscure meaning, but they do slightly reduce conciseness.  No critical information is omitted.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is generally faithful and understandable, with correct handling of most technical terminology.  It would benefit from a cleanup to remove duplicated lines, improve punctuation, and polish some awkward phrases.  With these adjustments, the Spanish version would read as naturally and clearly as the original French."
