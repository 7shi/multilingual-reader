  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally easy to read and follows the structure of the original dialogue. Sentences are long but clear, and technical concepts are explained in a way that a lay reader can follow. Minor issues such as the abrupt insertion of a numbered list break the flow, but overall comprehensibility is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most expressions sound natural for native Spanish speakers, with appropriate use of idiomatic phrasing (e.g., \"Aprenderá el francés a una velocidad asombrosa\"). Some literal phrasing (e.g., \"Vea usted\") feels slightly formal or awkward. Overall, the text reads smoothly with only occasional stilted moments.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\". The mixture of English and Spanish for terms like \"fine-tuning\" is acceptable, though an explanatory note might aid clarity. Terminology is consistent throughout the text.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely preserves the original intent, but the inserted meta‑commentary (e.g., the numbered list of key vocabulary) is not part of the original script and creates confusion. Cultural references are appropriately adapted, but the abrupt editorial insert detracts from the natural flow for the target audience.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major dialogue content is present, but the extraneous commentary and slight omissions of contextual cues (e.g., the absence of a brief explanation of the acronym ICL) reduce fidelity. The core information is intact, but the added text may mislead listeners about the original structure.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the core message and technical details of the original French podcast script, and it reads well for Spanish speakers. However, the unintended insertion of editorial notes disrupts the narrative flow and reduces contextual fidelity. The translation would benefit from removing the extraneous list and smoothing a few formal phrases to improve overall coherence and faithfulness to the source text. Overall, it is a competent translation but with room for refinement in contextual adaptation and editorial cleanliness. The average score across criteria is 16/20, indicating good quality but not perfect precision and adaptation to the target audience's expectations. The scoring rationale is presented in the 'reasoning' field for each criterion and summarized in the overall comment. The final overall score reflects the translation's strengths in clarity and terminology while accounting for the contextual and informational shortcomings."
