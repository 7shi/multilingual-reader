  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. The overall structure mirrors the French dialogue, and the explanations of concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are clear. Some sentences are a bit long, but the reader can still grasp the meaning without much effort.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but a few expressions feel slightly awkward. For instance, \"la IA no ha ‘olvidado’ en el sentido humano del término\" is clunky, and there are a few redundant words. The vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, but a smoother wording could improve readability.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\", \"memoria a corto plazo\" are all correct and consistently used. There is no mistranslation of key concepts, and the terminology matches what a tech‑savvy Spanish reader would expect.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and tone of the original podcast are preserved. Cultural references are minimal and adapted appropriately (e.g., \"Hola\" instead of \"Bonjour\"). The dialogue remains informal and conversational, which suits the podcast format. A few small cultural nuances could be refined, but the adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original text is present in the Spanish version. The explanation of how pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning and memory features work is complete. There is no significant omission, and the text stays concise without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality overall. It conveys the meaning, tone, and technical details of the original French text quite well. Minor improvements in fluency and smoothing some phrases could elevate it to near‑perfect, but it is already understandable and professional for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The total score reflects strong performance across all criteria, with particular strengths in terminology and information completeness, and room for slight enhancement in fluency and readability. Overall, a solid and reliable translation for a podcast audience."
