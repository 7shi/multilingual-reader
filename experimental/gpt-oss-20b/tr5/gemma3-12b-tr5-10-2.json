  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is clear and easy to follow. Sentences are generally short and the concepts are explained without excessive jargon. Some longer sentences could be split for even better clarity, but overall the flow is logical and accessible for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for native speakers. Minor awkwardness appears in a few phrasings such as \"una forma inteligente de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\" or the use of \"ancaje\" for \"grounding\". The vocabulary is contemporary and appropriate, but a few sentences could be slightly rephrased for smoother flow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"memoria a corto plazo\". The term \"grounding\" is translated as \"ancaje\", which is accurate in this context. Overall terminology is very good.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the cultural context of Spanish‑speaking audiences. Expressions such as “ventana de contexto” and the adaptation of the show title are appropriate. No cultural references from the original were lost or misinterpreted. A few expressions could be more idiomatic, but the intent is preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French script is retained. There are no omissions, and the translation does not add unnecessary content. The structure remains faithful to the dialogue format. A minor detail: the acronym ICL is not expanded in Spanish, but it does not impede understanding.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is high quality, maintaining the original meaning, tone, and structure. It is clear, fluent, and technically accurate, with only minor stylistic refinements possible. The target audience will understand the concepts without difficulty, and the dialogue feels natural for a Spanish‑speaking listener. Overall, it is an excellent translation suitable for publication or broadcast in Spanish‑speaking markets. The overall score is 18/20, reflecting strong performance across all criteria, with small room for polish in fluency and contextual idiomaticity. The total points awarded across all criteria sum to 91/100 (average 18.2/20)."
