  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally easy to follow and the overall sentence structure is clear. However, one sentence mixes French and Spanish (“C’est donc una memoria a solo uso”), which can momentarily confuse readers. Minor awkwardness appears in a few literal‑translated phrases (e.g., “el aprendizaje en contexto es bachotaje”) but they do not severely hinder understanding.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences flow naturally and use contemporary vocabulary. Minor issues include slightly clunky phrasing (“le damos simplemente las informaciones”) and the aforementioned mixed‑language fragment, which detract from the overall smoothness of the text.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled accurately and consistently: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje en contexto* (ICL), *anclaje* (grounding), *memoria*. The translation keeps the terminology aligned with the target audience’s expectations.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation preserves the original intent and cultural references. Spanish idiomatic expressions are appropriate, and the translation maintains the conversational tone of the podcast. The only contextual slip is the mixed‑language phrase, which slightly disrupts cultural consistency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French script is present, including the explanations of pretraining, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and concluding remarks. No substantive omissions or redundancies were found.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality overall, successfully conveying the original content while adapting it to Spanish. Minor issues—particularly the accidental mixing of French and Spanish in one sentence and a few slightly awkward phrasings—prevent it from achieving perfect fluency. With small adjustments, the text would read seamlessly to native Spanish speakers."
