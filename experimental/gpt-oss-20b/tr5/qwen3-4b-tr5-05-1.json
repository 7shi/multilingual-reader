    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version largely follows the original structure and conveys the main ideas, but several syntactic and lexical errors (e.g., wrong prepositions, misspelled words, abrupt phrase changes) interrupt the flow. These mistakes make some sentences difficult to parse, especially for a native reader who expects smooth, coherent dialogue. The core message remains understandable, but clarity suffers in a few places.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural expressions and grammatical slips: \"Hola y bienvenido en…\" instead of \"Hola y bienvenidos a…\", \"el apretar\" instead of a more idiomatic term for cramming, and mismatched gender/number agreement in places. While the overall tone is conversational, these issues reduce the naturalness of the text for a native Spanish audience.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are preserved correctly—pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory, etc. However, the word “apretar” is a mistranslation of the metaphor “cramming”, and the misspelling “conocencias” weakens precision. Still, the terminology is largely appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally respects the original intent and tone, but cultural nuances are occasionally missed: the use of “en” instead of “a” for location, the phrase “el apretar” that feels out of place in Spanish. Minor adjustments would improve alignment with the target audience’s expectations.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French original is present; no major content is omitted. Some repetitions and minor redundancies are introduced, but overall the dialogue remains concise and clear enough to convey the same concepts.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation faithfully captures the main ideas and technical content of the original French script. Nonetheless, several linguistic errors and awkward phrasings hinder readability and naturalness. Correcting prepositional errors, grammatical agreement, and replacing mistranslated metaphors would substantially improve the quality."
