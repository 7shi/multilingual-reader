  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely understandable, but the broken formatting, misplaced quotation marks and duplicate speaker tags interrupt the flow, making it less easy to follow than a cleanly written Spanish paragraph. The core ideas are present and the sentence structures are mostly logical, yet these surface issues lower readability.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation uses appropriate vocabulary, but the frequent double‑quotes, stray tags like \"Luc:\" inside the quoted speech, and some awkward literalisms (e.g., \"El ajuste fino…\") make the text feel slightly stilted to a native Spanish ear. Overall the passage sounds natural enough for comprehension but would benefit from smoothing and punctuation corrections.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto and anclaje are correctly rendered and consistently applied. The explanation style mirrors the original, so terminology handling is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the intent and tone of the original French dialogue. Cultural adaptation is adequate; idiomatic Spanish equivalents are used where appropriate. Some subtle nuances (e.g., the exact phrasing of the 'grounding' concept) are translated faithfully, but the overall contextual integrity is maintained.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the content from the French script is present in the Spanish version. However, formatting problems and occasional duplication of speaker tags can obscure meaning, and a few minor lines are slightly truncated or rephrased in a way that might lose subtlety. The core information is intact, but the surface issues reduce overall completeness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the main ideas and technical vocabulary of the original French podcast transcript. It is understandable and largely faithful to the source text. Nevertheless, the translation suffers from significant formatting and punctuation errors, duplicated speaker tags, and occasional awkward phrasing, which detract from its readability and fluency. Cleaning up the structure, normalizing quotation usage, and smoothing a few literal phrasings would noticeably improve the quality. Overall, the translation is good but not excellent, and would benefit from a careful proof‑read and editorial polish before publication to a native Spanish audience."
