    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to read and follows a logical structure. Sentences are generally short and the ideas flow coherently. Minor issues arise with some compound sentences that could be split for clarity, but overall the content is comprehensible to a native Spanish speaker. The use of simple language for complex concepts helps understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is quite natural overall, but there are a few unnatural expressions and grammatical errors that affect the smoothness of the text. For example, \"Lo han entendido todo\" should be \"Lo has entendido todo\" to match the singular speaker, and the use of English quotation marks and some literal phrasings (e.g., \"el modelo no ha « olvidado »\") feel out of place. These issues slightly hinder the naturalness, so the score reflects a good but not perfect fluency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine-tuning\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" (translated as \"anclaje\"), and \"ventana de contexto\" are accurate and consistent. The translation keeps the key terminology from the original while providing adequate explanations in context. No major omissions or misused terms are evident.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the conversational style and the overall intent of the original podcast. Cultural adaptation is adequate, though a few gender agreement errors (e.g., \"Lo han entendido todo\") slightly reduce the cultural polish. The speaker names and the format remain consistent, and idiomatic expressions are mostly appropriate for Spanish-speaking audiences. Therefore the score reflects a strong but not perfect adaptation.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All parts of the original script are present in the Spanish version, with no missing sections or omitted details. The translation maintains the same length and includes the same examples and explanations. The content remains concise and clear, with no unnecessary redundancy added. Thus the translation is complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation demonstrates solid accuracy and good adherence to the original content. It reads well and retains the technical terminology correctly. Minor fluency issues and a few grammatical slips slightly detract from the overall polish, but these do not prevent comprehension. With minor revisions to address the noted errors, the translation would reach a near-perfect score. As it stands, it is a competent and mostly natural rendering of the original French text."
