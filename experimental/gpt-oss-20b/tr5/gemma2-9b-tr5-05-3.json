  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally easy to follow and most technical ideas are expressed in clear, accessible Spanish. Sentence structure is logical and the dialogue flow mirrors the original. Minor punctuation omissions (e.g., missing commas after introductory phrases) slightly reduce readability but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most expressions sound natural for a Spanish-speaking audience, but there are a few awkward choices: \"afianzamiento\" for fine‑tuning, \"se refina\" instead of \"se afina\", and the phrase \"es una artimaña\" which feels clunky. The overall rhythm is smooth, yet these small inconsistencies affect the naturalness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely correct (pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto). However, \"afianzamiento\" is not the standard translation for fine‑tuning; \"ajuste fino\" would be preferable. The consistency of terms is acceptable but not perfect, leading to a moderate score.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue retains the original humor, structure, and show branding. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is largely faithful. Some expressions could be better tuned to colloquial Spanish (e.g., \"es una astucia\" instead of \"es una artimaña\"). Overall, adaptation is good.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present, and the dialogue order is preserved. No essential information was omitted, and the translation does not add extraneous content. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., \"se refina\" vs. \"se afina\") do not affect meaning.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful and readable, capturing the main ideas and conversational tone of the original French script. Some terminology inaccuracies (particularly the use of \"afianzamiento\" for fine‑tuning) and a few slightly awkward phrasing choices detract from perfect fluency. Nonetheless, the text remains clear, engaging, and suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience. Overall, the translation is solid with room for minor refinements in technical terminology and idiomatic expression to reach a more polished, native‑speaker standard. The overall average score is approximately 15.7 out of 20, rounded to 16/20 for the final evaluation."
