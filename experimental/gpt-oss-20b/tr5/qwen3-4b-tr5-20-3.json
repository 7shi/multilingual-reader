    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish transcript retains the conversational flow of the original French. Sentences are short and straightforward, making it easy for a native speaker to follow. Minor issues arise with some awkward article usage (e.g., *la IA* instead of *la inteligencia artificial* in a few places), but overall the text is comprehensible and logically organized.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the wording sounds natural and contemporary. Phrases such as *se le da simplemente la información* and *una función de memoria* are idiomatic. A few expressions feel slightly literal, e.g., *la IA no se afinan constantemente* (the plural verb agrees poorly with *IA*). These quirks do not impede understanding but lower the fluency marginally.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well: *pre-entrenamiento*, *afinamiento* (fine‑tuning), *aprendizaje en contexto*, *anclaje* for grounding, and *memoria* for the new feature. The translator remains consistent across the script. The only mild point is the use of *afinamiento* instead of the more common *ajuste fino*, but the chosen term is still understood by the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone. Cultural references remain neutral and appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic adjustments could improve engagement (e.g., replacing *se le da simplemente* with *se le proporciona*), but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, short‑term vs permanent memory, and the new memory feature. No significant omissions or additions that alter meaning appear. The translation is concise yet complete.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely accurate, clear, and well‑adapted. It retains the original conversational style and technical nuance while being accessible to a general Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic tweaks and a few grammatical adjustments would push the score even higher, but the current version is already of high quality and suitable for broadcast or publication as a podcast transcript or article. The overall quality merits an 18/20 rating, reflecting strong fidelity and naturalness across all evaluated dimensions. This makes it a reliable and professional translation that respects both the source material and the target readers' expectations."
