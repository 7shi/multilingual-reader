    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation uses clear and generally understandable sentence structures. However, minor typographical errors (e.g., \"pre‑entrerenamiento\", \"Transformeers\") and some awkward plural pronouns (\"vuestras\" instead of \"tus\") slightly hinder smooth reading. Overall, readers can follow the content without much confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely fluent, but a few grammatical slips (such as the misspelled words above, the phrase \"se le ha proporcionado una hoja de trucos\" and the slightly odd preposition usage \"justo antes de que empiece a hablarte\") reduce naturalness. It still sounds conversational and appropriate for a podcast context.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL), \"anclaje\", \"memoria a corto plazo\". Consistency is maintained throughout, and explanations are clear. Minor typo does not affect term understanding.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall tone, humor, and conversational style are preserved. Cultural references remain appropriate, and the translation adapts idiomatic expressions (e.g., \"hoja de trucos\" for \"antisèche\"). The title \"Tech Éclair\" is kept intact, respecting brand identity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All original content is present, including the dialogue structure, key explanations, and closing remarks. No substantive information is omitted; redundancies are minimal. The only issue is the typographical errors, not content loss.",
      "score": 19
    },
