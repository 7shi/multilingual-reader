    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and easy to follow. The dialogue structure mirrors the original, and the concepts are explained in a straightforward way. Minor hiccups occur with phrases such as “descubrimos” (should be “descubrimos”) and the use of “empollar” instead of the more common “aprender superficialmente”, but overall the text is understandable for a general audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly overall, but there are a few slightly awkward phrasings. For example, “descubrimos cómo los modelos de IA que usamos a diario aprenden y se vuelven tan inteligentes” mixes tenses; a more natural version might be “descubrimos cómo los modelos de IA que usamos a diario aprenden y se vuelven tan inteligentes”. The rest of the conversation flows well and uses appropriate contemporary vocabulary.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are translated correctly. “Pre-entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia” and “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)” are appropriate. The choice of “afinamiento” for “fine‑tuning” is understandable but less common than “ajuste fino”; still, it does not hinder comprehension. Overall terminology consistency is good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation stays true to the original tone and context. Cultural nuances are respected – for instance, the dialogue keeps the informal, conversational style. Minor adaptation issues appear, such as the use of the interjection “¡Exactamente!” in place of “Exactement”, but these do not change the meaning. The translation also respects Spanish punctuation and capitalization conventions.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French source is present. No key details were omitted, and the conversation’s flow is maintained. The only slight omission is a missing explicit mention of “grounding” as a concept, though the translation refers to it in the context of “anclaje”. Redundancy is avoided, keeping the content concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful and readable, preserving the original meaning and conversational tone. Minor fluency issues and some less conventional terminology choices slightly detract from a perfectly smooth read, but overall the translation is of high quality and would be well received by a native Spanish audience."
