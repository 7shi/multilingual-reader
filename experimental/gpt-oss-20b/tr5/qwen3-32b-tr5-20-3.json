  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The sentences are logically ordered and the concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning) are introduced clearly. Minor syntactic repetitions (e.g., several consecutive “la IA” clauses) slightly interrupt flow, but overall the text is easy to understand for a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally, but there are occasional awkward word choices and minor grammatical slips (e.g., “enviar una IA a la escuela” could be “enviarla a la escuela”, “el prompt” is left in English). The overall tone remains conversational, but a few phrases feel stilted, lowering fluency slightly.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "All key technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\" (fine‑tuning), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" and \"anclaje (grounding)\". The terminology is consistent throughout, and explanatory context is provided where needed.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation takes into account a Spanish‑speaking audience, preserving the show title and using culturally familiar metaphors (consultant, training program). Minor expressions could be more idiomatic, but overall the adaptation is effective and maintains the original intent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No essential content from the French original is omitted. The explanation of the difference between in‑context learning and fine‑tuning, the role of memory, and the conversational flow are all retained. Redundancy is minimal, and the text remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality: it faithfully conveys the original meaning, employs correct technical terminology, and is largely readable and natural. Slight improvements in fluency and stylistic polish would bring it to near perfection, but as it stands it is an excellent translation."
