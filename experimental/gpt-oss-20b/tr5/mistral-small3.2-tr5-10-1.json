  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically structured, and complex ideas such as the stages of AI learning are explained in a straightforward manner. Minor readability issues arise from occasional literal translations that make some clauses feel slightly clunky, but overall the target audience can grasp the content without confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly for most parts, but a few expressions feel slightly unnatural or overly literal, e.g., \"Se puede decir que es un truco\" and \"se ha sido vaciado\". Word choice is largely appropriate, yet there are opportunities to replace such phrasing with more idiomatic Spanish. Overall, the fluency is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated and correctly adapted for a Spanish-speaking audience: pre-entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, memoria. The translator preserves the nuance of the original, uses contemporary terminology, and keeps the terminology consistent throughout the script.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original tone and cultural context, maintaining the casual yet informative style of a podcast. Minor adjustments could be made to better match Spanish-speaking listeners' expectations (e.g., using more localized idioms or references), but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No essential information from the source text is omitted. All explanations of pre-training, fine-tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, and the memory feature are retained. The script remains concise and clear, with no unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation of the French podcast script is well‑executed overall. It retains the original meaning, uses accurate terminology, and delivers a clear narrative. The primary shortcomings lie in occasional literal phrasing that could be smoothed out to achieve a more natural flow for native Spanish speakers. With minor stylistic refinements, this translation would meet a professional standard for Spanish‑language podcast scripts."
