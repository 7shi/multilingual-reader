    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the flow of the original French dialogue. However, some sentences are grammatically incomplete or awkward (e.g., “El afinado. Es como enviar…”) and a few articles or prepositions are missing, which can momentarily disrupt the reader’s comprehension. Nevertheless, the overall narrative remains clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural to a Spanish speaker, but there are noticeable glitches: missing verb conjugations (“El afinado. Es…”), inconsistent use of the pronoun “vuestras” for “tus” in the same passage, and the occasional literal carry‑over of English/ French terms (e.g., *grounding*, *antisèche*). These errors make some sentences feel a bit stilted, reducing the smoothness of the text.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally handled correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *fin‑tuning* (translated as *afinado*), *In‑Context Learning* (*aprendizaje en contexto*), *grounding* (*anclaje*). The usage is consistent, though *fine‑tuning* could be more precisely rendered as *ajuste fino*. Overall, the terminology is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the informal conversational tone of the original podcast and adapted idiomatic expressions to Spanish where possible. Cultural references were kept faithful, and the use of metaphors (e.g., “un joven recién egresado”) fits well. Minor points of improvement: some literal translations (e.g., “antisèche”) could be localized further, and the phrase “El afinado” could be expanded to clarify the action.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The bulk of the original content is present, including the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning. A few short fillers like “Exactement” are omitted, but they do not alter the meaning. No major conceptual information is lost, and redundancies are largely avoided. Slight omissions (e.g., a brief mention of the speaker’s reaction to a question) are negligible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers the core message of the French source and keeps the conversational style appropriate for a podcast audience. There are some grammatical slips and a few terms that could be polished, but overall it is coherent, mostly natural, and faithful to the original meaning. With minor edits to improve sentence structure and refine terminology, it would reach a higher standard of fluency and readability. Overall, a solid translation that communicates the intended concepts well to Spanish‑speaking listeners, yet leaves room for fine‑tuning to achieve full native fluency and precision.  The overall score is **85/100**."
