  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is easy to read and follows the original's logical flow. Sentences are clear, and complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in a way that a native Spanish speaker can grasp. Minor structural quirks (e.g., repeated parenthetical clarifications) do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds largely natural, with appropriate vocabulary and grammar. However, there are a few slightly awkward phrasing choices (“aprendizaje contextual, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)”), punctuation inconsistencies, and the use of “bachotaje” instead of a more conventional term for “cramming.” These do not significantly detract from readability but slightly lower fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly translated: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL (aprendizaje en contexto), anclaje, memoria. Consistency is maintained, and the level of explanation suits a general audience. Minor inconsistencies such as “aprendizaje contextual” vs. “aprendizaje en contexto” are tolerable.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the target audience’s cultural context. Idiomatic expressions are adapted where necessary, and the podcast feel is preserved. The use of “consultor brillante” and the metaphor of a consultant is appropriate for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French script are present. No essential information is omitted, and the translated dialogue remains concise without unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, maintaining clarity, technical accuracy, and the conversational tone of the original French podcast. Minor stylistic improvements could enhance fluency, but overall it is a solid, faithful rendition suitable for native Spanish speakers."
