  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version retains the dialogue flow and logical progression of ideas, making it easy for native readers to follow. Complex concepts such as pre‑training and in‑context learning are explained in a clear, step‑by‑step manner, mirroring the original structure. Minor readability hiccups exist (e.g., a missing article in “parte de un contexto vacío”), but overall the text remains comprehensible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a Spanish speaker. Sentence structures are largely idiomatic, and the vocabulary choice is contemporary. A few small stylistic quirks – such as the ellipsis usage and a singular article omission – slightly disrupt fluency, but these do not impede understanding.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated (e.g., \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"transfer learning\", \"ventana de contexto\"). The term \"grounding\" is left in English, which is acceptable in a tech context. Overall terminology usage aligns well with the target audience’s expectations.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Cultural adaptation is handled appropriately: titles and expressions are localized (e.g., \"consultor brillante\", \"ventana de contexto\"). The podcast’s name remains unchanged, respecting brand identity. No contextual misunderstandings are present, and the tone is consistent with the original French version.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present. No substantive omissions occur, and the dialogue remains faithful to the source material. The translation adds no extraneous content, keeping the piece concise and clear.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation demonstrates a high level of quality, faithfully conveying the original meaning while maintaining natural flow. Minor grammatical slips and a slight inconsistency in one term do not significantly impact the overall clarity. The translator successfully preserves both technical accuracy and contextual nuance, resulting in a text that is clear, fluent, and fully informative for Spanish‑speaking audiences.\n\nOverall Score: 18.4/20 (rounded to 18.4)."
