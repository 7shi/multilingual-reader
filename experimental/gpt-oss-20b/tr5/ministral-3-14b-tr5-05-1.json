  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely comprehensible for a Spanish‑speaking audience, and the key ideas are preserved. However, several sentences lack articles or have awkward word order (e.g., \"Luc: entrenamiento previo\" and \"Camille: preentrenamiento\"), which slightly disrupts the flow. Overall, the text remains readable but could be smoother.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains numerous grammatical inconsistencies and unnatural phrasing (e.g., \"la IA no se va afinando\", missing articles such as \"ese recién graduado\"). While the vocabulary is generally correct, the sentence structure often feels forced, reducing the naturalness of the text. A native speaker might pause to re‑interpret some passages.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\". The abbreviation ICL is retained without explanation, and some nuances of \"in‑context learning\" are not fully conveyed. Consistency is good, but a brief explanation of key terms could improve understanding.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Cultural adaptation is moderate. Phrases like \"para darle una cultura general\" fit Spanish idiom, but some parts feel directly translated from French without adjusting to Spanish colloquialisms (e.g., \"la IA no se va afinando constantemente\"). The overall intent is preserved, yet the adaptation could be refined for a more native feel.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation covers most of the original content, but a few lines appear truncated or incomplete (the speaker tags for \"entrenamiento previo\" and \"preentrenamiento\" are missing context). Additionally, some explanatory details, especially about the memory feature, are less explicit than in the source. Minor omissions slightly affect completeness.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the main ideas and technical terms adequately, but grammatical and stylistic issues reduce its naturalness and readability. The speaker tags are sometimes inconsistent, and some explanatory content is missing or less clear. With some revision to fix article usage, clarify ambiguous phrases, and add brief explanations for key concepts, the text would be much more polished and accessible to Spanish‑speaking listeners. Overall, it is functional but not yet polished for a professional podcast transcript in Spanish. 15 out of 20 points are earned, reflecting good but improvable quality. 14 out of 20 points for the overall score, considering fluency and completeness gaps. 15 out of 20 points for the final score. 15/20."
