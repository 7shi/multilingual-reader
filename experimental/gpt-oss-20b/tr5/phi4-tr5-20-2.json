  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely clear and understandable. Sentence structures are logical and most complex concepts are explained in a straightforward manner. Minor adjustments (e.g., “imagine que…” instead of “imagínese que…”) could improve readability further, but overall the text is easy to follow.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for native Spanish speakers. However, a few expressions feel slightly awkward: \"funciones de memorización\" would sound more natural as \"funciones de memoria\" and \"afinamiento\" is less common than \"ajuste fino.\" These small issues prevent a perfect score, but the overall flow is natural.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", \"memoria a corto plazo\". The choice of \"afinamiento\" instead of the more standard \"ajuste fino\" is a minor deviation, but the terminology remains understandable. Consistency across the text is good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone while adapting to Spanish-speaking audiences. Expressions are appropriate and culturally neutral. Some phrases could be slightly more idiomatic (e.g., \"desenredamos\" could be \"desciframos\"), but the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French script is preserved. No key concepts were omitted, and the translated text provides the same level of detail. Minor stylistic differences do not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is high quality: clear, fluent, and technically accurate. Minor refinements in terminology and phrasing would elevate it to near-perfect. The translator has successfully captured the content and nuance of the original podcast script while making it accessible to Spanish readers."
