  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to read, with clear sentence structures and logical flow. Complex concepts such as pre‑training and in‑context learning are explained with suitable analogies. Minor issues arise with occasional long sentences that could be split for even smoother comprehension, but overall the reader can follow the dialogue without confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for Spanish speakers, using appropriate colloquial expressions like \"como contratar a un consultor brillante\". However, the use of asterisks around technical terms (*prompt*, *grounding*, *transfer learning*) gives an unintended formatting impression and a few phrases are slightly literal (e.g., \"le transfiere sus habilidades matemáticas existentes\"). These small quirks prevent a perfect score.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\". There is some inconsistency in the use of English words in italics (e.g., *grounding*, *prompt*), which could be translated as \"anclaje\" or \"entrada\". Nevertheless, the chosen terminology remains understandable for the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator successfully adapts cultural references and idiomatic expressions. Phrases such as \"es como estudiar de memoria para un examen\" and the consultant metaphor resonate with Spanish-speaking listeners. No significant loss of intent is observed, and the content feels tailored to a Spanish-speaking context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue and key points from the original French version are preserved. No major information is omitted, and the translation includes necessary explanations. Minor redundancy is avoided, and the content remains concise while comprehensive.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation demonstrates a high level of quality, faithfully conveying the original meaning and maintaining the conversational tone. Small refinements—removing formatting asterisks, ensuring consistent terminology, and tightening a few long sentences—would elevate the text to near‑perfect fluency and precision. Overall, it is an effective, well‑adapted translation suitable for a native Spanish audience."
