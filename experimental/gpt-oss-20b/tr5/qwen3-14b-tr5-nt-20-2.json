  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is largely coherent and easy to follow for Spanish‑speaking readers. Long sentences are occasionally split, but the overall flow remains understandable. However, some clauses feel slightly clunky (e.g., *\"se le proporcionó una trampa justo antes de que comenzara a hablarle\"*), which can momentarily distract readers. The explanation of concepts such as pre‑training and fine‑tuning is clear, though minor phrasing choices could improve smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text mostly reads naturally, but several expressions feel forced or informal for a professional podcast transcript. Words like *\"trampa\"*, the use of quotation marks around *\"olvidado\"*, and some literal literalisms (*\"vaciar su espacio de trabajo temporal\"*) break the flow. Vocabulary is largely appropriate, yet a few awkward constructions reduce the overall smoothness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *ICL*, *grounding* → *anclaje*. The choice of *\"fine‑tuning\"* as *\"afinamiento\"* is acceptable. Terminology is consistent across the transcript, and no major inaccuracies appear. Minor clarifications could be added to aid non‑technical listeners, but the translation meets the criterion well.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and tone of the original are preserved. Cultural references remain neutral, appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The adaptation from French to Spanish is smooth, although certain idiomatic choices could be improved for local flavor. No loss of meaning or cultural nuance is evident.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present. No significant omissions are observed. The translation keeps the content concise, with only minor redundancies that do not alter meaning. The explanation of ICL versus fine‑tuning and the discussion of memory features are faithfully rendered.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and largely faithful to the original French script. While technical terminology and informational content are well preserved, a few phrasing choices disrupt naturalness and readability. Refining these expressions would elevate the transcript to a smoother, more polished level suitable for native listeners of a podcast setting. Overall, the translation meets the primary objectives but could benefit from a more nuanced stylistic polish to fully match native expectations for flow and idiomatic usage."
