  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains large amounts of extraneous commentary (e.g., *« Luc: 1. **Vocabulaire clé y expresiones** »* blocks) that do not belong to the dialogue. These blocks interrupt the flow and make it hard for a reader to follow the conversation. When the dialogue itself is read, the sentences are mostly clear and the concepts are understandable, but the presence of these meta‑annotations lowers overall comprehensibility. Overall score: 10/20.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several phrases are awkward or incorrect for native Spanish speakers. Examples include *« antiespuma »* (a literal, nonsensical translation of *“anti‑cheat”*), *« le modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus conversaciones. Simply utiliza un sistema más inteligente …”* (mix of English and Spanish) and *« se tiene la impresión de que la IA recuerda los detalles de mi proyecto, pero en realidad, le hemos proporcionado una antiespuma justo antes de que ella empiece a hablar con ustedes»* (clumsy wording). These reduce the naturalness of the text. Overall score: 8/20.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are translated appropriately (e.g., *pré‑entraînement* → *preentrenamiento*, *affinage* → *afinamiento*, *ICL* → *aprendizaje en contexto*). However, inconsistencies appear: *anclaje* is used instead of *ancrage* in some places, and *fine‑tuning* is rendered as *afinado* (acceptable but slightly informal). Additionally, the inserted commentary often repeats definitions unnecessarily. Overall score: 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sometimes uses expressions that feel out of place for a Spanish‑speaking audience (e.g., *« se tiene la impresión de que…»* instead of *« parece que…»*, *« le hemos proporcionado una antiespuma»*). Cultural references are largely preserved, but the meta‑commentary lines disrupt the intended tone of a podcast script. The script’s conversational style is mostly retained, but the adaptation could be smoother. Overall score: 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The core dialogue and key explanations are present, but the inserted commentary segments replace some original lines, leading to slight omissions and duplication. Some explanations (e.g., the function of *memory* features) are paraphrased but still convey the main idea. However, the extraneous notes reduce clarity and add redundancy. Overall score: 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation shows good grasp of technical terminology and preserves the main ideas, but it is severely hampered by the inclusion of unrelated commentary blocks and awkward phrasing. These issues compromise readability and naturalness. A cleaner, more faithful rendering without the meta‑notations would greatly improve the quality. The translation, as it stands, is acceptable for a technical audience but requires substantial editing to meet professional standards for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience."
