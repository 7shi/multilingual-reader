  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but several spelling mistakes (e.g., \"conocencias\" instead of \"conocimientos\"), awkward phrasing, and redundancies hinder the flow. The core ideas are conveyed, yet the reader may have to reread parts to grasp the meaning.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains multiple grammatical slips, such as wrong gender agreement and the use of the verb \"apretar\" where the French original meant a figurative sense of studying for an exam. Phrases like \"el aprendizaje en contexto es el apretar\" sound unnatural to native Spanish speakers. Some sentences feel disjointed and the overall prose lacks the smoothness expected in a polished podcast transcript.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms like \"preentrenamiento\" and \"fine-tuning\" are correctly rendered, and the abbreviation ICL is maintained. However, the translation misapplies the term \"grounding\" as \"sostén\" and mixes it with unrelated concepts. Consistency could be improved, especially in the use of \"ajustar\" for fine‑tuning versus the broader sense of learning.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the conversational tone and references, which is good for the target audience. Cultural adaptation is mostly adequate, but certain phrases (e.g., \"apretar\") misrepresent the original meaning, reducing effectiveness. Overall, the intent is preserved, but some local idiomatic choices could be refined.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French transcript are present. No critical content is omitted. However, the confusion caused by erroneous wording could lead to misunderstandings, slightly detracting from clarity. Redundancies are minimal and largely unnecessary.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the essential ideas but suffers from several grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and terminology misalignments that compromise readability and naturalness. With a few revisions—especially correcting misspellings, refining awkward expressions, and aligning terminology—the text could reach a high-quality standard suitable for native Spanish-speaking listeners. Currently, it reads as a competent but imperfect adaptation that would benefit from careful proofreading and editing before publication or broadcast. Overall, the translation is functional but needs improvement to achieve professional polish and clarity. The final score reflects the translation’s solid content foundation tempered by the noticeable language issues present in the draft."
