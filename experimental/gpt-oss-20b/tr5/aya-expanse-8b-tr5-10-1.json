    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is mostly easy to follow, but several long, complex sentences could be broken up for clarity. Some expressions such as “la IA se recuerda de esta información” are awkward and may confuse readers who expect a more natural phrasing. The general structure is logical, and the content is comprehensible, though a few points could be simplified for better flow.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains a few unnatural turns of phrase and grammatical inconsistencies—e.g., “la IA ‘se recuerda’ de esta información” and the use of “pré‑entrenamiento” with a non‑Spanish accent and hyphen. Some sentences feel stilted or overly literal, which detracts from the smoothness expected in native Spanish.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and ICL are present, but the orthography of ‘pré‑entrenamiento’ is incorrect for Spanish. Additionally, ‘ancrage’ is left untranslated, and there are occasional mismatches in terminology consistency (e.g., “aprender en contexto” vs. “aprendizaje en contexto”).",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational tone is largely preserved, and cultural adjustments like the show title ‘Tech Relámpago’ are acceptable. However, some phrases feel more literal than idiomatic, and the overall adaptation could better reflect Spanish-speaking media norms.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all content from the original is conveyed, and the narrative flow remains intact. Minor omissions include the untranslated term ‘ancrage’ and a slightly condensed explanation of the memory feature, but the core information is present.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the overall meaning and dialogue flow of the original French script, but it suffers from several linguistic and technical inaccuracies that reduce its naturalness and clarity for Spanish-speaking audiences. Addressing orthographic errors, refining awkward phrasing, and ensuring consistent terminology would markedly improve the quality. The content is largely complete, yet the stylistic polish needed to match native expectations is lacking."
