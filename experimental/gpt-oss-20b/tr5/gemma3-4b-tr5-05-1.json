  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to read and follows a logical flow. The dialogue structure is preserved, and complex ideas are explained in a straightforward manner. However, a few awkward phrasings (e.g., *Imaginen que enviamos una IA completamente nueva a la escuela* instead of *Imaginemos que enviamos una IA...*) and a missing accent (*Ahi* instead of *Ahí*) slightly reduce clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall, the translation sounds natural for Spanish‑speaking readers. Minor issues remain: some literal word‑for‑word choices create slightly clumsy sentences, and there is a small inconsistency in the use of *aprendizaje contextual* vs *aprendizaje en contexto*. The grammar is generally correct, but these minor quirks make the text less smooth than it could be.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately rendered: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *memoria a corto plazo*, *ventana de contexto*. The only potential confusion is the inconsistent use of *aprendizaje contextual* and *aprendizaje en contexto*, but both are acceptable and understood in the target audience. Overall, terminology handling is very good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, using culturally familiar expressions and idiomatic phrasing (e.g., *como contratar a un consultor brillante*). There is a slight lack of adaptation in the phrase *Ahi es donde entra en juego* (missing accent), but otherwise the cultural nuance is well maintained. The text feels appropriate for Spanish listeners who are familiar with AI terminology.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, the memory feature, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. No substantive information is omitted, and the translation does not add extraneous content. The text is concise and retains the same level of detail.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is highly accurate and comprehensible, faithfully reproducing the dialogue and technical content of the French original. Minor refinements in accent usage, consistency of terminology, and a few smoother phrasings would elevate the fluency to a perfect score. Overall, it is an excellent translation suitable for native Spanish‑speaking audiences familiar with AI concepts.  "
