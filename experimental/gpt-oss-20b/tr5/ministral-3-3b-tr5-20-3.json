  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation frequently breaks logical sentence flow, introduces incomplete clauses, and uses awkward phrasing (e.g., *Domina los conceptos generales de gramática* instead of *Domina los conceptos generales de gramática*). These issues make it harder for a Spanish‑speaking listener to follow the dialogue, especially for non‑native speakers. Overall readability is compromised but still somewhat understandable. Score: 8/20.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several sentences are ungrammatical or unnatural for native Spanish (e.g., *La IA **almacena** estas informaciones* instead of *La IA **almacena** esta información*). Phrases like *apri* or *apri* and mismatched verb tenses create a disjointed rhythm. While the vocabulary is mostly correct, the overall flow feels mechanical and lacks the smoothness expected in a spoken podcast script. Score: 6/20.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *afinado*, *in‑context learning* (ICL) are present, but their usage is inconsistent. The translation sometimes mixes English abbreviations (*ICL*) with Spanish equivalents (*aprendizaje en contexto*) without clear guidance. Some key concepts (e.g., *grounding* vs *anclaje*) are translated loosely, causing potential confusion. The translator also omitted explanations that were present in the French original. Score: 10/20.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the overall intent of explaining AI training stages, but several contextual nuances are lost or misrepresented. For instance, the Spanish version starts with a different introductory line (*desvelar cómo funcionan los modelos de IA…*) that diverges from the French *Tech Éclair* branding. Cultural references and idiomatic expressions are not fully adapted (e.g., *bachotage* is rendered as *bachotage* instead of a Spanish equivalent). The dialogue feels somewhat disjointed and does not match the conversational tone of the original. Score: 7/20.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Key details from the French script are omitted or altered: the explanation of *grounding* is truncated, the comparison between *memory* features and *ICL* is not fully articulated, and the final closing lines are incomplete. Some content is duplicated or missing (e.g., the final call‑to‑action “¡Nos vemos!” lacks the context). However, the bulk of the main ideas is present. Score: 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a basic grasp of the source material but falls short in several critical areas. Readability and fluency suffer from grammatical mistakes and unnatural phrasing, making the script feel disjointed. Terminology is partially correct but inconsistent, which could confuse listeners. Contextual adaptation and information completeness are also lacking, as the translator diverges from the original intent and leaves out important details. The final product would likely need substantial editing to meet the quality standards expected for a polished Spanish‑language podcast script. Overall, the translation scores moderately low, reflecting the need for significant refinement."
