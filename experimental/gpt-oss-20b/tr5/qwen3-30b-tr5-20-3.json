    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is disjointed and fragmented. Key sentences from the original are missing or replaced by unrelated fragments (e.g., random greetings, incomplete instructions). As a result, a native Spanish reader cannot follow the narrative or grasp the logical flow of ideas. The text lacks coherent paragraph structure and logical sequencing, severely limiting readability.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many phrases are literal or stilted, e.g., \"preentrenamiento\" instead of the more natural \"preentrenado\", and the overall syntax is awkward. The translation contains abrupt interjections like \"Hola\", \"El perro corre rápido\", and repeated instructions that break the natural rhythm. Consequently, the text feels clunky and unnatural to a Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Some technical terms are present (e.g., \"afinamiento\", \"memoria a corto plazo\"), but many are misspelled or misapplied. The concept of \"In-Context Learning\" is not clearly rendered, and terms such as \"contexto\" are used inconsistently. Additionally, the translation introduces unrelated technical vocabulary (“transferencia de aprendizaje”, “memoria a corto plazo”) that obscures rather than clarifies the original meaning.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to adapt the original cultural references or maintain the conversational tone of a podcast. The Spanish version includes irrelevant interjections and misaligned dialogues that diverge from the original intent. The context is lost, making the adaptation ineffective for Spanish-speaking audiences.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the source text are omitted or replaced with nonsensical fragments. Key explanations about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, and memory mechanisms are missing or incorrectly rendered. The translation lacks the depth and nuance necessary for full comprehension.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation demonstrates significant deficiencies across all evaluated aspects. It is fragmented, contains numerous unrelated interjections, and fails to convey the technical concepts and narrative structure of the original French text. The result is a text that is difficult to read, unnatural, and incomplete. A comprehensive rewrite is required to achieve a faithful, clear, and culturally appropriate translation suitable for native Spanish listeners of a technology podcast."
