  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely understandable and follows a logical sentence structure. However, occasional long sentences and an inserted bullet‑point list that was not in the original may slightly disrupt the flow for some readers. Overall, the text can be followed with relative ease.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for most Spanish speakers, but there are a few grammatical and punctuation issues (e.g., misplaced commas, use of the French word *bachotage* within quotation marks). The occasional retention of English terms such as *fine‑tuning* could be polished for consistency. Despite these minor hiccups, the text sounds smooth overall.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently – *preentrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *memoria*. The mix of English and Spanish terms is acceptable, though a fully translated version would improve uniformity. The terminology is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the original intent and conversational tone, adapting expressions to Spanish without losing cultural nuance. The added explanatory bullet point is not required, but it does not distort the context. Minor wording choices could be refined for a more idiomatic feel.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential ideas from the French source are present in the Spanish version. The extra bullet list does not omit any content and only adds a small explanatory note. No major information is missing, and redundancy is minimal.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and conveys the core concepts effectively. While there are small stylistic and grammatical adjustments that could improve fluency, the translation meets the key criteria of clarity, technical accuracy, and contextual fidelity. It is ready for a general Spanish‑speaking audience with only minor editorial polish needed."
