  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated dialogue is mostly understandable, but the text is heavily fragmented and contains numerous formatting errors (extra quotation marks, duplicated lines, misplaced 'Or,' fragments, unfinished sentences). These mistakes make it difficult for a native Spanish reader to follow the flow, especially in the middle of the transcript. The core concepts are conveyed but the reading experience is disrupted.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While many sentences read naturally, the translation includes awkward constructions (e.g., \"Camille: 'El pre-entrenamiento' becomes El pre-entrenamiento\"), inconsistent use of quotation marks, and incomplete phrases that break the rhythm. Additionally, some expressions (like \"le proporciona la información que necesita para la tarea a hacer\") feel literal and clunky. Overall, the fluency is acceptable but noticeably hindered by these issues.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as *pre-entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, and *in‑context learning* are correctly translated and used consistently. However, some terms are left untranslated or inconsistently handled (e.g., *grounding* is partially retained in English). Despite these minor lapses, terminology is largely appropriate for a general audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The cultural adaptation of the podcast context is adequate—names, idioms, and the overall tone match a Spanish-speaking audience. Nevertheless, the translation fails to smooth out the original's informal conversational style due to the structural errors noted, and the title *Tech Éclair* remains untranslated, which could be localized for greater resonance.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Significant portions of the original dialogue are missing or garbled, particularly in the middle and towards the end of the transcript. The translation contains duplicated passages, truncated sentences, and placeholder fragments like \"Mencionando 1.\" and \"long et 1 ...?\". These omissions result in a loss of crucial information and narrative continuity.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the gist of the original dialogue but is marred by formatting mistakes, incomplete sentences, and inconsistencies that severely affect readability and coherence. While terminology and contextual adaptation are largely correct, the overall quality is below acceptable levels for a polished, ready‑to‑publish transcript. Substantial revision is needed to produce a smooth, faithful Spanish version of the podcast script. The translation would benefit from a thorough proofread and reconstruction of the broken sections to ensure completeness and natural flow for Spanish listeners. The current version is best suited for an internal draft rather than a final product."
