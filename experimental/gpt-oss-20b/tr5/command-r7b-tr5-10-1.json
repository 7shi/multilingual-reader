    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable and follows the logical flow of the original. The dialogue structure and the key ideas are preserved. However, some phrases such as \"La fase de calentamiento\" feel awkward for a Spanish-speaking audience, and a few long sentences could be split for easier reading. Overall, the text is readable but could benefit from minor restructuring.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation sounds natural and maintains the conversational tone. Still, there are a handful of unnatural constructions: \"La fase de calentamiento\", \"el ajuste\" (instead of \"el afinamiento\"), and some repetitive wording. Punctuation is generally correct, but occasional commas are missing. The vocabulary is contemporary and appropriate, though a few terms could be refined for smoother flow.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely correct: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\". Consistency is mostly maintained, though \"ICl (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\" mixes capitalization. The translation provides sufficient explanation of concepts without excessive jargon. Overall, terminology is handled well.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and keeps the dialogue natural for Spanish listeners. Some idiomatic expressions from French (e.g., “l’atelier”) were translated literally, but this did not hinder comprehension. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is appropriate. A few phrases could be more idiomatic (e.g., \"punto crucial\" → \"punto clave\").",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All sentences from the original are present, and no essential information is omitted. The translation faithfully reproduces the dialogue and key explanations. Minor additions (e.g., clarifying that the model does not learn from conversations) are helpful. No unnecessary redundancies were introduced.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and captures the main ideas of the French original. While readability and fluency are good, some phrases feel slightly literal or awkward. Terminology and completeness are strong, and the contextual adaptation is adequate. With a few stylistic refinements, the translation would achieve a higher level of polish. Overall, it meets the expectations for a clear, accurate, and engaging podcast transcript in Spanish. The overall score, averaging the five criteria, is 15.4 out of 20, rounded to 15/20 for simplicity. This reflects a solid translation with room for minor improvements in naturalness and stylistic refinement. If a more detailed point allocation is needed, it can be provided upon request."
