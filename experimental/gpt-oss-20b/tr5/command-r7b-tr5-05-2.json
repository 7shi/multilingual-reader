  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience, and the overall structure follows the original dialogue format. However, several places contain residual French words (e.g., \"Précisément\") and duplicated speaker labels (\"Luc: Luc\"), which interrupt the flow and may confuse readers. Some sentences are slightly awkward or incomplete, reducing overall clarity. Overall, readability is adequate but not exceptional.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the vocabulary choice is generally correct, the translation contains noticeable unnatural expressions and grammatical errors: repeated speaker tags, misplaced accents, and phrases that read like a literal word‑for‑word translation rather than natural Spanish. These issues make the text feel stilted to native readers. Fluency would improve with smoother phrasing and removal of duplicated tags.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL). The translation consistently uses these terms and includes parenthetical translations where helpful. Minor inconsistencies (e.g., translating \"grounding\" only once) exist, but overall terminology is appropriate and understandable.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation stays faithful to the original intent and keeps the conversational tone. It does not fully adapt to Spanish cultural references or idiomatic expressions that could enhance engagement. Some literal phrases (e.g., \"ventana de contexto\") could be refined. The adaptation is functional but could be more polished for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The majority of information from the original French text is present, including all key concepts and examples. However, a few sections are incomplete or slightly garbled (e.g., missing parts of sentences, duplicated speaker tags), leading to minor omissions and redundancies. The translation could be tightened to avoid repetition while keeping all essential content.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the core content and terminology of the original French dialogue but is hindered by several artifacts such as leftover French words, duplicated speaker tags, and awkward phrasing. These issues reduce readability and fluency. The translation would benefit from a thorough proof‑read, removal of non‑Spanish elements, and smoother sentence construction to meet the standards expected for a polished, native‑level podcast script. Overall, the work is competent but requires refinement to achieve high quality and naturalness for a Spanish audience. Score: 13.5/20 (rounded to 14)."
