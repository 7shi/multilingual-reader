  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally easy to read, with clear sentence structure and logical flow. Most technical concepts are adequately explained, and the dialogue format preserves the original conversational tone. Minor issues arise in a few places where a phrase feels slightly abrupt (e.g., “Se puede decir que estas funciones…”) but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version sounds natural for a native speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. Occasional awkwardness occurs in the expression “Se puede decir que estas funciones de memorización son una forma astuta de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado.” The use of the term “memorización” instead of “memoria” for the feature is slightly unnatural. Nonetheless, the overall fluency is good.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently. Terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprender en contexto* (ICL), *anclaje*, and *memoria* are translated accurately. The translator retained acronyms and did not obscure meaning. Minor inconsistency in the capitalization of *Memoria* versus *memoria* could be noted, but it does not affect understanding.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and purpose. Cultural references are adapted suitably (e.g., “consultor brillante” instead of a literal literal phrase). The adaptation respects Spanish‑speaking audiences and does not introduce extraneous idioms. The text is appropriate for a general Spanish‑speaking tech audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the source is present. No important details are omitted, and the explanation remains concise. The translation does not add unnecessary repetition; it keeps the dialogue style. Thus the completeness is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a strong grasp of both the source material and the target language. It retains the original dialogue structure, conveys all technical concepts accurately, and presents them in clear, fluent Spanish. Minor refinements could further polish certain phrasing, but the overall quality is excellent and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience familiar with AI concepts. Overall score: 90/100 (18/20 × 5)."
