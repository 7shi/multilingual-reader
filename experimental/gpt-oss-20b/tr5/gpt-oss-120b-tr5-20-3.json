  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to read and follows the original sentence structure closely. Phrases such as “El preentrenamiento” and “El afinamiento” are clear. Some sentences are a bit long and could be broken up for better flow, and the use of the word “chuleta” introduces an informal tone that might not be appropriate for all audiences. Overall, the text is comprehensible, but minor refinements would improve readability.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly fluent, with correct grammar and punctuation. However, certain word choices (“afinamiento” instead of the more common “ajuste fino”, “chuleta” being informal slang, and the phrase “La IA no se afina constantemente con tus conversaciones”) make the text sound slightly unnatural to a native speaker. These issues reduce overall fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally handled well: \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\", and \"in‑context learning\" are accurately translated. The untranslated word \"prompt\" remains, which is acceptable for an audience familiar with AI terminology. Minor inconsistencies (e.g., using \"afinamiento\" vs. \"ajuste fino\") and lack of a Spanish equivalent for \"prompt\" slightly weaken consistency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original tone and most cultural references. However, the use of the informal term “chuleta” may not resonate with all Spanish‑speaking listeners, and the phrase “La IA no ha «olvidado» en el sentido humano del término” could be phrased more naturally. Cultural adaptation is largely preserved but could be polished.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original is present. No key points are omitted, and the speaker dialogue structure is maintained. The translation does not add extraneous content, though a few sentences are repeated conceptually, which does not detract significantly from conciseness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation accurately conveys the meaning of the French original and preserves the conversational flow. It demonstrates solid knowledge of AI terminology and keeps the structure faithful to the source. Minor issues—such as slightly awkward phrasing, informal slang, and minor terminology inconsistencies—prevent it from being a perfect, native‑level translation. With a few revisions to improve naturalness and consistency, the translation would reach an excellent level of quality. Overall, it is a competent and clear rendition suitable for Spanish‑speaking audiences, but not yet flawless for publication in a professional podcast script. 17/20"
