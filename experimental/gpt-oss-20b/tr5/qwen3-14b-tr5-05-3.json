    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, especially for Spanish-speaking listeners familiar with podcast dialogue. The sentences follow a logical order and the flow of ideas mirrors the original. However, a few constructions are awkward or overly literal (e.g., “Lo han entendido todo”), which slightly hampers smooth comprehension. Overall, readers can grasp the concepts but may notice some minor syntactic oddities.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation feels functional but is not entirely natural. Phrases like “Lo han entendido todo” and “Esto se hace posible gracias a la expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo de la IA” are slightly clunky. Some verb forms and article usage are inconsistent. While the vocabulary is generally appropriate, the flow would benefit from smoother phrasing and more idiomatic expressions. The text is intelligible, yet the overall native‑speaker experience is diminished.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\" and \"grounding\" (anclaje) are accurate and consistent. There are no major mistranslations, and the terminology aligns with current Spanish AI parlance. Minor improvements could be made (e.g., \"ajuste fino\" for fine‑tuning), but the existing choices are acceptable.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The script retains the original tone and conversational style. Cultural adaptation is minimal, which suits a Spanish‑speaking audience. The translation does not stray from the intent of the original, but some culturally specific nuances (e.g., references to consulting or education) could be slightly refined for Latin‑American contexts. Overall, the adaptation is faithful and appropriate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French version are present in the Spanish translation. There are no obvious omissions; the dialogue covers pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, and the memory feature. The translator sometimes uses a more explicit phrasing (e.g., “la IA no ha ‘ olvidado ’”), but this does not detract from the conveyed meaning. The content remains concise and clear, with no unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and generally faithful to the original French script. It successfully conveys the core concepts and dialogue flow, making it accessible to Spanish‑speaking listeners. However, some linguistic imperfections—particularly in verb usage and article placement—slightly affect the naturalness and readability. With minor stylistic polishing, the translation would achieve a high level of fluency and polish suitable for a professional podcast audience. Overall, it demonstrates a solid grasp of the subject matter and the target language, albeit with room for refinement in expression and idiomatic smoothness. The overall score reflects this balanced assessment, acknowledging the translation’s strengths while noting areas for improvement.\n\nTotal Score: 80/100."
