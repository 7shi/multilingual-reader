    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to read and follows a logical sentence structure.  Most concepts are explained clearly, though a few sentences suffer from minor awkwardness or missing articles that slightly hinder smooth comprehension.  Overall, readers can follow the dialogue without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation flows well for the most part, but there are several spots where phrasing feels literal or slightly off‑standard.  Examples include “Lo olvida todo” (acceptable but could be “Lo olvida por completo”), “cuando abres una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío” (should be “partes de un contexto vacío”), and some punctuation inconsistencies.  Vocabulary is largely appropriate and contemporary, but the overall naturalness would benefit from a final polish.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently and appropriately for a general audience.  Preentrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje por transferencia, anclaje, ICL, memoria a corto plazo, etc., are all correctly rendered.  The translation provides no unnecessary jargon and keeps terminology stable throughout the episode.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue’s intent and tone are preserved; idiomatic expressions are adapted reasonably to Spanish context.  The use of “empollar” to mirror “bachoter” works, and the metaphor about a consultant is retained.  Cultural references are neutral and do not create confusion for Spanish‑speaking listeners.  Minor stylistic adjustments could further enhance readability for specific target audiences.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French transcript are present in the Spanish version.  No essential content was omitted, and the translation does not introduce extraneous information.  Redundancy is minimal, and the dialogue remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and largely faithful to the original French script.  Technical terminology and core concepts are accurately conveyed, and the dialogue remains understandable for native Spanish speakers.  Minor grammatical tweaks and more natural phrasing in a few sentences would elevate the quality to near‑perfect, but as it stands the translation serves its purpose well."
