  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains numerous bullet‑point annotations, repeated translations of the same line, and awkward sentence structures. While the meaning is mostly understandable, the text is cluttered and hard to follow. Many paragraphs are interleaved with commentary that breaks the flow. The overall readability for a native Spanish speaker is moderate but impaired by redundancy and formatting issues.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text uses a mix of correct Spanish expressions and literal, sometimes unnatural translations (e.g., \"fin‑tuning\" → \"afinamiento\"), and some phrases feel stilted or unidiomatic. The abundance of parenthetical comments and duplicated lines makes the reading feel disjointed. Consequently, the fluency is acceptable but not smooth or natural.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"In‑Context Learning\" and \"grounding\" are largely preserved, but some translations (e.g., \"fine‑tuning\" → \"afinamiento\") may not be the most common Spanish equivalents. There are occasional inconsistencies and missing clarifications for non‑technical readers. Overall, terminology is understandable but could be improved.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original French podcast is adapted into Spanish, but many cultural references and idioms are left untouched or copied verbatim (e.g., \"cajas negras\" for \"boîtes noires\"). The translation also retains French formatting (bullet points, bold tags) which may confuse Spanish listeners. Some expressions could be culturally tailored better to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major content from the original is present; no substantial omissions are detected. However, the inclusion of repetitive commentary and annotations leads to redundancy, and some explanatory passages are unnecessarily verbose, slightly diluting clarity. The overall information is complete but could be presented more concisely.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely faithful in content but suffers from formatting clutter, redundant commentary, and some awkward phrasing. Readability and fluency are hindered by the interspersed annotations, and the terminology choices, while understandable, are not consistently optimal. A cleaner, more streamlined translation would greatly enhance comprehension and naturalness for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Overall, the work meets the basic requirements but requires significant editing to reach a high‑quality standard. The translation reflects a moderate effort but would benefit from tighter editing and better contextual adaptation to Spanish audiences. The overall score is 9/20, reflecting the need for improvement in several key areas, especially readability and fluency."
