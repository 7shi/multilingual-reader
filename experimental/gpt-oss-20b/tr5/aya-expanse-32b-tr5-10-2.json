    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely comprehensible, with clear explanations of complex concepts. Sentence structure is generally logical, though a few awkward phrasings (e.g., “en esta ventana de conversación” instead of the more natural “en esta conversación”) slightly impede flow. Nonetheless, a reader can follow the dialogue without confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation feels mostly natural for native speakers. However, there are several instances of slightly clunky wording and grammatical quirks – such as the use of \"apunta\" where a more common term like \"fragmento\" or \"nota\" would be preferable, and occasional redundancies like repeating \"en esta ventana\". Vocabulary is generally appropriate, but a smoother style would improve overall readability.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are well‑handled: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), ventana de contexto, anclaje, memoria a corto plazo. Consistency is maintained throughout, and the terms match the expected understanding level of the target audience. The minor typo \"apunta\" detracts slightly but does not undermine the overall terminology quality.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and cultural nuance. The choice to rename the podcast from \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Tech Relámpago\" is a sensible adaptation, although it slightly alters the original brand. Expressions are generally appropriate for Spanish‑speaking listeners, with no major cultural missteps. Minor stylistic improvements could enhance naturalness.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present in the Spanish translation. No substantive content is omitted, and supplemental clarifications (e.g., explaining ICL and memory) are adequately provided. A few sentences are slightly repetitive, but overall conciseness and clarity are preserved.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation achieves a solid balance between fidelity to the source text and readability for a Spanish audience. While it excels in terminology accuracy and content completeness, occasional awkward phrasing and a minor lexical choice error reduce fluency. With minor refinements—particularly smoothing sentence flow and correcting \"apunta\"—the translation would reach an excellent level of quality for broadcast or publishing use. Overall, it is a competent, largely faithful rendering that effectively conveys the nuances of the original French dialogue to Spanish‑speaking listeners. The final evaluation score is 18 out of 20, reflecting a high-quality, though not flawless, translation."
