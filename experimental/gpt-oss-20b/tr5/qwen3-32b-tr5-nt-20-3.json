  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to follow, with a logical sentence structure that mirrors the original French dialogue. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in clear terms. However, a few sentences feel slightly wordy (e.g., the extended explanation about the consultant analogy), and some long‑running parenthetical remarks could be tightened for smoother reading. Overall, readability is high but not perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most native Spanish speakers. Word choices are appropriate and contemporary. Some minor unnatural expressions appear, such as \"Tienes toda la razón\" where the original meant \"You have understood everything\", and occasional repetition of exclamations like \"¡Efectivamente!\". These do not severely impede comprehension, but they slightly lower the fluency score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "All technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"In‑Context Learning\" (ICL), \"grounding\" (anclaje) and \"Memoria\". Explanations of concepts are kept faithful to the original. No mistranslations or misleading jargon were found.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., using \"Hola y bienvenidos\" would have been slightly more inclusive). The overall tone matches a conversational podcast, and expressions such as \"desentrañamos\" and \"moldea\" fit Spanish idiom. Minor differences in phrasing are harmless and do not alter intent. Adaptation is good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves all key points of the French original: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, context window, ICL, grounding, memory features, and the analogy of temporary vs permanent knowledge. No significant omissions are present, and the content remains concise while still explanatory. Small redundancy could be trimmed, but it does not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the technical content and conversational tone of the original. Minor fluency and readability issues are present but do not detract from overall comprehension. Terminology is accurate and consistent, and the adaptation fits a Spanish‑speaking audience well. The translation could benefit from slight tightening and a few more idiomatic phrasing to reach perfection, but it is well‑executed overall. 86/100 points earned reflect strong competence in both linguistic accuracy and contextual adaptation. 86/100"
