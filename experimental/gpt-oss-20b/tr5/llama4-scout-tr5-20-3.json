  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely understandable to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Most sentences follow the same logical order as the original French and the key concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL, grounding) are explained in a straightforward way. However, a few sentences are overly long or awkwardly punctuated, which can momentarily confuse the reader. Overall, readability is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly fluent, but there are several instances where the wording feels literal or stilted. For example, the line \"El aprendizaje en contexto, es del bachotaje.\" uses an odd comma placement and the word \"bachotaje\" is less common in modern Spanish. There are also a few duplicated speaker labels (\"Luc: Luc:\") and a mix of French and English terms that break the flow. These quirks lower the fluency score.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are translated correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\". However, the term \"ancrage\" was left in French with the English word \"grounding\" in parentheses, which is inconsistent and confusing. Some terms could be further clarified (e.g., \"context window\" as \"ventana de contexto\") but overall terminology is largely appropriate.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and uses culturally appropriate expressions, such as comparing a newly trained model to a fresh graduate. Still, a few phrases are overly literal or feel out of place in Spanish (e.g., \"en la otra mano\" for \"en la otra mano\"). The adaptation is effective but could be polished to sound more natural.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French source is present in the Spanish version. There are no major omissions, and redundant content is largely avoided. Minor punctuation errors do not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation delivers the core ideas clearly and keeps the conversation structure intact. However, it shows several small issues that affect naturalness and consistency: duplicated speaker labels, mixing of French and English terminology, and a few awkward phrasings. With minor revisions, the text could reach a higher level of polish and fluency. Overall, it is a competent translation that would serve most Spanish‑speaking listeners, but native reviewers might notice the inconsistencies and could benefit from a cleanup for publication or professional use. The average of the criterion scores gives an overall rating of 15/20, indicating a solid but improvable translation effort. "
