  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is mostly understandable, with clear explanations of concepts like pre‑training and fine‑tuning. However, occasional fragmentary sentences (e.g., \"El afinado.\") and awkward word choices make some passages harder to follow. Overall, readers can grasp the main ideas, though a few revisions would improve flow.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many sentences contain grammatical or stylistic errors: \"El aprendizaje en contexto es como el bachotaje: las informaciones que proporcionas en el prompt son efímeros.\" (should be \"efímeras\") and the abrupt period after \"El afinado\" disrupts naturalness. Word choice is sometimes literal and not idiomatic. The result is a text that feels clunky to native speakers, lowering fluency.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms are generally present, but there are inconsistencies. \"Fine‑tuning\" becomes \"afinado\" (more natural would be \"afinamiento\" or \"ajuste fino\"). \"Grounding\" is left untranslated, which can confuse readers. Other terms like \"preentrenamiento\" and \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" are appropriate and consistent. Overall terminology is acceptable but not perfect.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation stays close to the original, preserving the informal conversational tone suitable for a podcast. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is limited. The lack of idiomatic adjustments makes the text slightly less engaging for a Spanish audience, but the intent and purpose are largely maintained.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys all major points from the original—pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and memory features. Minor omissions or distortions are present (e.g., incomplete sentences), but no essential information is lost. Redundancy is largely avoided, though some awkward phrasing could obscure meaning.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the core content of the French original but is marred by grammatical slip‑ups, inconsistent terminology, and occasional syntactic fragments. While the main ideas are intelligible, the text would benefit from polishing to enhance naturalness and readability for a Spanish‑speaking audience. It is functional for general listeners but not exemplary in linguistic precision or stylistic polish."
