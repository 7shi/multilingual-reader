  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and the main ideas are clear. However, there are several grammatical mistakes and awkward phrasing that can interrupt the flow—for example, repeated speaker labels (“Luc: \"Luc: Y soy Luc.””), the use of a French article “Le” in “Le pre‑entrenamiento,” and sentences that are too long or missing connecting words. These issues reduce overall readability. The structure is logical, but the execution needs refinement.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the vocabulary is mostly correct, the text contains several unnatural constructions and punctuation errors that make it sound mechanical. Phrases such as “Imaginad que enviamos una IA…” are not idiomatic Spanish and the frequent misplacement of quotes and colons gives the transcript a disjointed feel. The flow could be smoother with more natural phrasing and consistent formatting. Overall fluency is moderate.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"anclaje\" are appropriate. The translation also keeps key concepts such as transfer learning and memory consistent. Minor issues arise with the untranslated French phrase \"Telle est la réalité de l'ICL\" and the occasional missing explanation for non‑technical readers. Nonetheless, terminology handling is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to localize the content for Spanish speakers, using familiar expressions and avoiding overly literal translation of some French idioms. However, cultural adaptation is weakened by the presence of untranslated French fragments and by a few literal phrasing choices that feel out of place. The overall intent is preserved, but the adaptation could be polished.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original information is conveyed. There are no major omissions, but a few errors (e.g., the stray French phrase and duplicated speaker labels) introduce inaccuracies. The translation maintains the dialogue flow and covers the key concepts. Redundancy is minimal, though some sentences could be more concise.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation communicates the main ideas and retains most of the technical terminology, but it is marred by repeated speaker labels, grammatical slips, and a few untranslated French fragments. The readability and fluency would benefit from a careful proofreading and smoothing of phrasing. With these adjustments, the translation could reach a high level of quality, but as it stands it is good but not excellent. The score is a reflection of these strengths and weaknesses: 15 (readability) + 13 (fluency) + 17 (terminology) + 14 (contextual adaptation) + 15 (information completeness) = 74 out of 100, or a 7.4/10 overall.
