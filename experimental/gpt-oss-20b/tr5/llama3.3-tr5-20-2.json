  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version retains the overall structure and flow of the original French script. Sentences are generally clear, and complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in a way that should be comprehensible to a general audience. Minor long sentences and repeated “la IA” may slightly interrupt the reading rhythm, but overall readability is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but a few literal renderings and small grammatical slips reduce the sense of smoothness. Examples include “la IA no se afina constantemente con tus conversaciones” (more idiomatic would be “la IA no se afina continuamente a partir de tus conversaciones”), “tiene la impresión” instead of “tiene la impresión de que”, and a misplaced accent on “comenzás” instead of “comienzas”. Vocabulary choices are largely appropriate, but occasional awkward phrasing detracts from full fluency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and adapted correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"ICL\". The translation also consistently uses the Spanish equivalents for the main concepts and avoids mistranslations. The only minor issue is the brief appearance of the abbreviation \"ICL\" without an initial expansion, but the surrounding text clarifies the meaning. Overall, terminology handling is excellent.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the core intent of the podcast, preserving the informal dialogue style, the names of the hosts, and the cultural references. Minor expressions such as “la IA es como enviar una IA completamente nueva a la escuela” feel slightly literal, but they still convey the intended metaphor. The adaptation respects Spanish‑speaking audience expectations and does not introduce culturally inappropriate content.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation includes all key points from the original script. No substantial information is omitted: the sequence of pre‑training → fine‑tuning → in‑context learning, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, and the explanation of memory‑augmented features are all present. A few small details (e.g., the final exclamation mark) are missing, but they do not materially affect the overall message. The text is concise yet comprehensive.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and largely faithful to the original French. It captures the main ideas and the informal conversational tone of the podcast. However, it suffers from a handful of literal translations and minor grammatical errors that slightly hinder fluency. With a few stylistic refinements and proofreading, the translation could reach a near‑perfect standard for native Spanish readers. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for publication or broadcasting, but polishing would raise its professional polish further. The average score across categories is 17.6/20, rounded to 18/20 for the overall rating. This reflects a well‑executed translation with room for minor improvements in naturalness and polish."
