  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is largely understandable, especially for Spanish-speaking audiences familiar with basic technical concepts. However, several sentences are awkwardly structured or include unnecessary questions that break the flow, slightly hampering comprehension. Overall, readers can follow the conversation but may need to reread certain parts for clarity.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many expressions feel literal and unnatural—for example, \"Aprendizaje en contexto, o AIC (In-Context Learning)\" mis‑names the acronym and introduces a foreign abbreviation that Spanish readers will not recognize. Phrases such as \"aplicado a la nueva tarea\" or \"una forma inteligente de aprendizaje en contexto automatizado\" are clunky. These issues reduce the naturalness of the translation.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms like \"fine‑tuning\" and \"in‑context learning\" are generally well rendered as \"afinamiento\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\", but the mistranslation of the acronym to \"AIC\" is a notable error. Some terminology is inconsistent—\"afinamiento\" is used in several places, while \"fine‑tuning\" is absent. Overall, terminology is understandable but not consistently applied.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational tone of the original podcast is preserved, but cultural adaptation is limited. For instance, the opening greeting switches to \"Buenos días\" which is fine, but other expressions remain overly literal. The translation does not significantly tailor idioms or references to Spanish-speaking audiences, missing opportunities for smoother localization.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is present, but a few elements are slightly distorted or omitted. The inserted question about language learning is not in the original, and the explanation of the memory feature is slightly simplified. The core concepts remain, though, and no critical technical detail is lost.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and conveys the main ideas, but it suffers from several literal choices, a mistaken acronym, and some awkward phrasing that reduce readability and naturalness. With a few refinements—especially correcting technical labels and smoothing sentence structures—the translation would reach a higher level of quality suitable for native Spanish speakers familiar with AI terminology. Overall, it’s a good foundation but requires polishing for a professional release."
