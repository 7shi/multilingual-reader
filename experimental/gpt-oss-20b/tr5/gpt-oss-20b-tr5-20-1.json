  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, but several issues affect clarity. The opening speaker tag is duplicated (`Camille : Camille :`) which confuses the format. The phrase `¿Porque ya entiende los conceptos` is missing a space after the question mark and should read `¿Por qué ya entiende`. Several sentences are slightly wordy and could be streamlined for easier comprehension. Overall, readers can follow the content but the readability suffers from these typographical and syntactic quirks.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural expressions. For example, `¡Una analogía perfecta!` is correct but feels abrupt; the phrase `Se puede decir así.` is vague. The use of parentheses and quotation marks is inconsistent (`«in-Context Learning»` vs `ICL`). The text also includes some literal repetitions from the original that sound stilted in Spanish. Despite these flaws, the general flow is smooth enough for native speakers to understand, so fluency scores moderately.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly and consistently: `preentrenamiento`, `ajuste fino`, `aprendizaje por transferencia`, `ventana de contexto`, `in-context learning (ICL)`, `anclaje`, and `memoria a corto plazo` are all appropriate and contemporary. Minor alternatives could be considered (e.g., `aprendizaje contextual`), but the chosen terms are accurate and well understood by a Spanish-speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and sense, and it uses culturally neutral phrasing suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience. The only notable shortfall is the duplicated speaker label at the start, which could be confusing. Aside from that, the adaptation is faithful and no awkward cultural references appear that would mislead listeners.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are present in the Spanish version. No essential information is omitted, and the explanation of concepts such as fine-tuning and in-context learning remains intact. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., the order of clauses) do not affect the overall content. Thus, the translation is largely complete and concise.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the gist and technical content of the original French script, with correct terminology and a clear, mostly coherent structure. However, typographical errors, some redundant speaker tags, and slightly awkward phrasing reduce readability and fluency. The translation is adequate for a general audience but would benefit from a final proofreading to polish these issues and improve naturalness.\n\nOverall score: 15/20."
