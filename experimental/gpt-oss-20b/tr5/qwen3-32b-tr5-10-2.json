  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated dialogue is largely understandable and follows the original structure. However, duplicate lines, misplaced accents (e.g., \"¿Porque\" instead of \"¿Por qué?\"), and the presence of untranslated French fragments interrupt the flow. These issues lower overall readability.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural, but the retention of French wording in several places (e.g., \"Telle est la réalité de l'ICL\", \"C'est incroyablement flexible\", \"l'équilibre\") and the repeated phrase \"Ella olvida todo\" make the text feel uneven and somewhat awkward for a native Spanish reader.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"fine-tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ICL\" and \"anclaje\" are accurately rendered. Minor issues include the French word \"antisèche\" which is left untranslated, but overall terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation generally respects Spanish idiomatic expressions and cultural context. The occasional use of French terms reduces the cultural adaptation quality. Some phrases could be further naturalized (e.g., \"la competencia está anclada\" could be \"la competencia está consolidada\").",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the full content of the original script; no substantive information is omitted. The duplicate line is a minor error but does not remove any information. Overall, the completeness is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully conveys the main ideas and technical concepts, but several linguistic errors—duplicate sentences, leftover French fragments, incorrect question forms—affect readability and naturalness. Correcting these issues would make the translation excellent for a Spanish-speaking audience. Overall quality: 15/20 points.  The work is good but needs refinement to reach a professional standard for broadcast or publication in Spanish-speaking markets.  The score reflects strong content fidelity but room for improvement in linguistic polish and consistency."
