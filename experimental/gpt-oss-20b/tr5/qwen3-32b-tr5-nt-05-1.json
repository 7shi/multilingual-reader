  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the script’s conversational tone is preserved. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are explained in plain language. Minor repetitions (e.g., “se le proporcionan las informaciones” vs. “le proporciona”) slightly disrupt flow, but overall readability is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary choices are contemporary and appropriate (e.g., \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\"). Some expressions feel a bit literal, such as “una forma ingeniosa de aprendizaje contextual automatizado” which could be smoother, but no major grammatical errors. The text reads fluently, so the score is close to perfect.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are translated consistently and correctly: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL (aprendizaje en contexto). The use of acronyms is clear. The Spanish equivalents are accurate for a general audience, and the explanation of terms is consistent with the original French script.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and informal style, and uses culturally familiar expressions (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenidos\"). The podcast’s name remains unchanged. Minor adaptations could improve idiomatic feel, but the content is well tailored to Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French source is retained; no major omissions or additions are present. The script remains concise, and redundancy is minimal. The translation keeps the logical progression of ideas intact.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version faithfully conveys the meaning and tone of the original French script. It is clear, natural, and technically accurate, with only minor areas where phrasing could be tightened. Overall, it is a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience of the podcast’s target demographic. The average score is 18.2/20, reflecting strong performance across all evaluation criteria. The translation demonstrates a good balance between literal fidelity and fluid, culturally appropriate language usage, making it well‑suited for the intended listeners.\n\nScore: 18.2/20"
