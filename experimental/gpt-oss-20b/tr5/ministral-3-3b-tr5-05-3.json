  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated passage is mostly understandable, but several sentences are awkwardly constructed and some have missing verbs or incorrect capitalization (e.g., \"Expansión\" at the beginning of a sentence). The flow is generally logical, and complex ideas are broken into short sentences, which aids comprehension. However, minor grammatical slips detract from a fully smooth reading experience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains several unnatural expressions and errors in gender, accentuation, and word order. Phrases like \"Mécánica cuántica\" (French accent) and \"Capa de Cachado de Inferencia\" are unidiomatic in Spanish. Capitalization mistakes and incomplete clauses reduce the overall naturalness. While the vocabulary is largely appropriate, these issues lower fluency.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered (e.g., \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\"). However, the translation of \"Fine‑tuning\" as \"El afinado\" is acceptable, but the subsequent explanation of \"ICL\" as \"Capa de Cachado de Inferencia\" is incorrect and confusing. The consistency of terminology is moderate, but some key terms are misrepresented or missing clarifications.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation to Spanish culture is limited. The show title changes from \"Tech Éclair\" to \"Tech Flash\", altering the original brand. Some cultural references remain in French (e.g., \"Mécánica cuántica\"), and the translation does not fully account for Spanish idiomatic expressions or audience expectations. Therefore, contextual adaptation is partially achieved but not optimal.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French transcript are present in the Spanish version. The translation preserves the sequence of ideas and the explanatory style. Minor omissions are negligible, and no major content is lost. The text remains concise and clear, though some repetition could be tightened.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers the core content with reasonable clarity, but it suffers from several linguistic inaccuracies that affect fluency and terminology. The title change and a few French terms lingering in the text suggest incomplete contextual adaptation. Overall, the work is functional but would benefit from a careful proof‑read and refinement of key terms to improve naturalness and consistency for a Spanish-speaking audience. Average overall score: 14/20."
