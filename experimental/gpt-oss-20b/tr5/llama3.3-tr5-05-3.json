  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely understandable. Sentence structures mirror the original dialogue and complex concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL) are explained with clear analogies. Minor typographical issues (missing accents, plural “informaciones”) do not impede comprehension. Overall readability is high but not perfect.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker, but some expressions feel slightly awkward or redundant. For example, “El aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)” repeats the same phrase, and “se le proporcionan las informaciones” uses an unnecessary plural. Overall the fluency is good but has small stylistic flaws.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are preserved: preentrenamiento, afinado, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, grounding (anclaje). The acronyms are kept consistent, and the translation avoids mistranslations. However, “anclaje” for “grounding” could be clearer with an explanation. Term consistency is solid, but minor refinements would improve precision.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Cultural references (consultor brillante, bicicleta) fit Spanish-speaking audiences, and the conversational tone matches the original podcast style. The translation keeps the intent of the speakers and adapts idioms appropriately. A few phrasings could be polished for naturalness, but overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves all essential information from the original. No significant omissions are detected, though the parentheses after ICL repeat the phrase rather than translate ‘In‑Context Learning’. Minor textual redundancies exist but do not compromise clarity. The content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and largely faithful to the original. Readability and contextual adaptation are strong, while fluency and terminology receive minor points for awkward phrasing and a slightly unclear choice for ‘grounding’. Overall, the translation communicates the technical content effectively but could benefit from a final polish to enhance naturalness and precision. Overall score: 16/20. 17+15+16+17+16 = 81 → average ≈ 16.2, rounded to 16 out of 20."
