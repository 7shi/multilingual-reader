  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version uses clear sentence structures and straightforward wording, allowing readers to follow the dialogue without difficulty. Minor points are lost for a slightly awkward use of “atiborrarse” and the occasional repetition of phrases, but overall the content remains highly understandable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly for native Spanish speakers, with appropriate verb forms and colloquial expressions. Some phrasing such as “El aprendizaje en contexto es como atiborrarse para un examen” could be rendered more idiomatically (e.g., “estudiar intensamente para un examen”). The term “ajuste fino” is acceptable but less common than “afinación”. Overall, the fluency is high with only minor naturalness issues.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly translated: “pre-entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto”. However, the word “ancrage” remains untranslated and “grounding” is only partially explained. Consistency could be improved by fully localizing these terms. Minor omissions do not affect comprehension significantly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and conversational tone, respecting cultural expectations of a podcast script. Slightly formal wording such as “El modelo en sí no aprende ni evoluciona” may feel a bit stiff, but overall the adaptation is effective. There is room for more natural Spanish idioms, but the key messages are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogues and key explanatory points from the French script are present. No major information is omitted, and the Spanish text maintains the same logical flow. The only small gap is the lack of a fully localized explanation for “ancrage/grounding”, but this does not materially alter the content.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is faithful, clear, and largely natural. It conveys the original meaning with minimal loss, though a few terminology choices could be refined and a couple of expressions made more idiomatic. It is suitable for a general audience and retains the informative and conversational style of the source."
