    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable and follows the logical flow of the original. Sentence structures are clear and the use of everyday Spanish makes the content accessible. Minor readability issues arise from awkward phrasing such as “en el prompt” and the incorrect acronym “AICL”, which may momentarily confuse readers. Overall, comprehension remains high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural, but several spots feel stilted or carry a literal English flavor. Expressions like “Aprendizaje In-contextual”, “en el prompt” and the misuse of the acronym “AICL” disrupt fluency. The overall rhythm is good, yet a few sentences could be smoother if localised more fully (e.g., using *ajuste fino* instead of *afinamiento*).",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *anclaje*, *memoria a corto plazo*. However, the term *afinamiento* is uncommon in Spanish, where *ajuste fino* is preferred, and the acronym *AICL* is a typo for *ICL*. The consistency across the text is good, but a few term choices could be refined.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references appropriately—e.g., “una nueva ventana” for *une nouvelle fenêtre*—and the overall intent of the podcast is preserved. Nonetheless, some idiomatic touches could be improved (e.g., using *en la conversación* instead of *en la sesión* in certain contexts). The text respects the Spanish-speaking audience’s expectations, but a few subtle adjustments would enhance contextual resonance.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the original French script are present: pretraining, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, temporary vs permanent knowledge, and the notion of memory features. Minor omissions or distortions exist mainly around the acronym error and the usage of *prompt*, but the overall message remains intact and concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers a clear, mostly fluent Spanish rendition of the original French podcast script. While it successfully conveys the technical concepts and the conversational tone, it suffers from a few linguistic slips—particularly with the acronym *AICL* and the literal use of *prompt*—that could be smoothed out for a more native feel. Addressing these minor issues would bring the translation into a higher caliber of polished, professional quality. Overall, it is a competent translation with a solid foundation for further refinement to achieve near‑native fluency and precision in terminology usage."
