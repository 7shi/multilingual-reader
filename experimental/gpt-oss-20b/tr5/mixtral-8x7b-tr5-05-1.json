  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is highly fragmented, containing many incomplete sentences, stray numbers, and inserted commentary. As a result, readers find it difficult to follow the narrative flow or grasp the intended meaning. The overall clarity is low, so the score is modest. 5/20.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation includes numerous awkward phrasings, abrupt line breaks, and unnatural word choices (e.g., \"¡Hola y bienvenidos a \"Tech Iluminado\"…\", repeated exclamation marks, and literal but incorrect renderings). These elements break the natural rhythm expected from a native Spanish speaker, yielding a very low fluency score. 4/20.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Some technical terms were translated correctly (e.g., \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"memoria a corto plazo\"), but many were mishandled or omitted (e.g., \"affinage\" as \"ajuste fino\" instead of \"fine‑tuning\", mis‑translation of \"grounding\", and loss of terms like \"ICL\"). Consistency is lacking. 6/20.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The cultural adaptation is generally inadequate; the translator often retains literal phrasing or inserts irrelevant commentary that does not serve the target audience. The intent of the original podcast script is not clearly conveyed, reducing the effectiveness of the adaptation. 5/20.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are missing or significantly altered, leading to omissions of key explanations and examples. Redundancy is introduced through repeated explanatory fragments. Therefore the information is not fully preserved. 4/20.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is far from a professional or polished rendition of the original French script. It suffers from incoherent structure, many linguistic inaccuracies, and a lack of faithful representation of the source material. This version would likely confuse listeners and fails to serve the purpose of a clear, engaging podcast script. Improvement in all categories is necessary before it could be considered usable. 5/20 total."
