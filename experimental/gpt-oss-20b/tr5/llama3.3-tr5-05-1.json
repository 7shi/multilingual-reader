  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to read, with clear sentence structures that mirror the French dialogue. Technical concepts such as *preentrenamiento* and *aprendizaje por transferencia* are introduced with simple explanations, making the content accessible to a general audience. A few long sentences could be split for greater clarity, but overall the flow remains coherent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly smooth and natural for Spanish speakers. Some expressions feel slightly literal (e.g., \"aprenderá el francés a una velocidad increíble\" could be \"aprenderá francés rápidamente\") and the repetition of parenthetical terms like \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\" can feel redundant. Minor grammatical adjustments would enhance fluency, but the text remains largely idiomatic.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently and appropriately: *preentrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning* (kept in English, acceptable for tech context), *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *grounding* → *anclaje*. Explanations are present where needed, and term usage is uniform throughout the transcript.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural adaptation is modest but sufficient; Spanish idioms are not over‑used, which keeps the dialogue universal. The content remains relevant to Spanish‑speaking listeners without losing nuance from the French version.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present, including explanations of *preentrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *anchoring*, and the memory‑like feature. No essential information is omitted, and redundancy is avoided by maintaining a concise structure.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is strong and faithful to the original, successfully conveying technical concepts in clear Spanish. Minor fluency tweaks and a few more natural phrasings would elevate the quality, but as it stands it meets the needs of a general Spanish‑speaking audience while preserving the dialogue’s original spirit and clarity. Overall, a competent and reliable translation with room for minor polishing in style and flow to achieve a truly native feel. The final overall score is 17/20, reflecting a solid but slightly improvable result in fluency and stylistic nuance. The reasoning behind each score is detailed above and takes into account readability, fluency, terminology, contextual adaptation, and completeness of information. The translation effectively communicates the content while maintaining consistency and clarity throughout the conversation. Overall, it is a good job, but a few small edits could bring it up to a more polished, professional standard."
