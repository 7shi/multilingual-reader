    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable for a general audience. The sentences are mostly coherent, but some awkward constructions (e.g., “¡Exactamente! Esto es el Aprendizaje en Contexto en acción.”, “La diferencia entre estudiar de memoria… es…”) interrupt the flow. Technical ideas are mostly conveyed, but a few phrases could be simplified for clarity.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text feels largely natural, but there are several stilted or non‑idiomatic expressions: “El afinamiento” is correct, yet “ajuste fino” would sound more native; “en una nueva ventana de conversación” is a literal translation that sounds awkward in Spanish. Some verb tenses and articles are misplaced (“una cantidad mucho menor de texto”). Overall, it reads smoothly but could benefit from polishing.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered (pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL). Consistency is good, though “ajuste fino” could replace “afinamiento” for consistency with common usage. Explanations are present where needed (e.g., transfer learning). Minor issues: “aprendizaje en contexto” is repeated correctly, but “anclaje” could be clarified as “grounding.”",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The cultural adaptation is adequate: the translation keeps the conversational style, uses Spanish idioms where appropriate, and localizes expressions (e.g., “consultor brillante” instead of a literal “consultant.” However, some phrasing feels too literal (e.g., “en una nueva ventana de conversación”), and the title “Tecno Flash” deviates from the original “Tech Éclair” but remains understandable.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, short‑term vs long‑term memory. Minor omissions: the fragment “La diferencia entre estudiar de memoria… es…” is incomplete, which slightly reduces clarity. No significant information is lost, and the translation is concise.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely faithful and comprehensible, preserving the original meaning and technical detail. Minor issues with natural phrasing and a few incomplete sentences detract from an otherwise solid job. With some polishing—especially of idiomatic expressions and sentence structure—the text would read like native Spanish content."
