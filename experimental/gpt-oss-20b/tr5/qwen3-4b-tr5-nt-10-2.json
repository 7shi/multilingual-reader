  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated dialogue is understandable but heavily cluttered by the numerous annotation blocks (e.g., “1. **Vocabulario y expresiones clave**…”) that interrupt the flow.  The sentence structure is generally correct, but the interspersed bullet‑point notes break logical continuity and make it hard for a reader to follow the conversation smoothly.  The core ideas are present, yet the readability suffers due to this formatting issue.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains several literal, somewhat awkward constructions (“se tiene la impresión”, “se inserta automáticamente estos extractos en el prompt”) that do not sound entirely natural to a native Spanish speaker.  Some verb tenses and prepositions are slightly off, and the overall rhythm feels stilted in places.  While the translation is intelligible, it does not read as a polished, fluent Spanish script.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are handled reasonably: “fine‑tuning” → “afinamiento”, “in‑context learning” → “aprendizaje en contexto”, “grounding” → “anclaje”.  However, consistency is occasionally lost (e.g., “fine‑tuning” is sometimes left in English).  The terminology is suitable for a general audience, but more precise Spanish equivalents (“ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje en contexto”) could improve clarity.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent of the original podcast—explaining AI training concepts—is preserved.  Cultural references are largely unchanged, but some idiomatic nuances (“consultor brillante”, “conocer los conocimientos”) feel a bit literal.  The adaptation works, but could benefit from more natural Spanish idioms that resonate with a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French source are present in the Spanish version, and no critical content has been omitted.  The extra annotation blocks actually add detail rather than remove information, but they also create redundancy and distract from the main dialogue.  Aside from this formatting issue, the translation is comprehensive.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the main ideas and keeps the technical accuracy, but readability and fluency are hampered by the inserted annotation notes and some literal phrasing.  Removing the explanatory bullet points and refining a few awkward expressions would significantly improve the text, making it clearer and more natural for Spanish‑speaking listeners.  The terminology is mostly correct, and the information coverage is solid, but attention to style and cultural nuance would raise the overall quality to a professional standard for podcast scripts in Spanish."
