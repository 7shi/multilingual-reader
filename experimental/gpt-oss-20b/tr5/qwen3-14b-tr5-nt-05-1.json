    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely understandable and follows the original narrative flow. Sentences are generally short and clear, with only occasional complex structures that might slightly challenge casual listeners. Overall, readers can grasp the technical concepts without confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads well for a native Spanish speaker, though a few expressions feel slightly literal or awkward (e.g., \"se le ha dado una nota previa justo antes de que comenzara a hablar contigo\"). Vocabulary is contemporary and appropriate, and punctuation is correct. Minor tweaks would improve naturalness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine-tuning\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"ICL\" are correctly rendered and consistently used. Explanations accompany the terms, aiding comprehension. No significant mistranslations observed.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and tone. Cultural references are neutral and suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience. Minor adjustments (e.g., gender agreement with \"vuestras conversaciones\") could fine‑tune the adaptation, but overall it is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the source text are preserved. No critical information is omitted, and redundancies are minimal. The translation remains concise while conveying the same level of detail.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version faithfully reproduces the French original’s meaning and structure. It is clear, technically accurate, and largely natural for native speakers. Minor linguistic refinements would raise the fluency, but the translation meets high standards of readability, terminology, and completeness. Overall, it is an excellent rendition suitable for the target audience, with only small room for polishing to achieve perfect naturalness and consistency across all instances of key terms and phrasing. The translation can be considered a strong B+ in quality, suitable for broadcast or professional listening contexts with minimal editing required. The overall rating reflects a solid 18/20 balance between accuracy, clarity, and stylistic smoothness. Overall rating: 18/20 (very good)."
