    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is straightforward and the sentences are logically arranged, making it easy for a Spanish‑speaking audience to follow. The speaker turns and explanations mirror the original dialogue structure, preserving clarity. Some very long sentences could be shortened for better flow, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for a native Spanish speaker. Idiomatic expressions such as \"se le proporciona la información\" and \"se le proporciona un anclaje\" sound natural. Minor quirks include the repetition of \"ajuste fino\" and the use of \"lo olvida todo\" which is acceptable, though slightly abrupt. No major grammatical errors or awkward phrasings are present.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL), \"anclaje\" for grounding, and \"memoria a corto plazo\". The translation maintains terminology that is familiar to Spanish‑speaking technical audiences, and provides the same explanations as the original. Slight variation between \"memorización\" and \"memoria\" could be unified, but overall it is consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version adapts expressions to Spanish cultural norms while keeping the original intent. Phrases such as \"consejero brillante\" for a consultant and the comparison with a university graduate resonate with Spanish listeners. The structure and tone of the dialogue are preserved, and the cultural references (e.g., discussing AI as a consultant) are appropriate. The translation does not lose nuance or intent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant information from the original French text is omitted. All key concepts—pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, short‑term memory, and the memory feature—are present. The Spanish translation provides sufficient detail to be fully understood, with no unnecessary redundancies. Minor variations in phrasing do not affect the conveyed meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the original dialogue’s meaning, tone, and technical content while adapting it naturally to Spanish. Minor stylistic refinements could raise fluency, but overall it is clear, accurate, and reader‑friendly. It would serve well for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts and podcast-style narration. The overall score reflects an excellent translation with only small room for polish, resulting in a solid 18/20 overall rating. The translation preserves intent, terminological precision, and cultural relevance while maintaining clarity and ease of reading. The final evaluation: 18/20. This reflects a highly competent translation suitable for professional and casual listeners alike."
