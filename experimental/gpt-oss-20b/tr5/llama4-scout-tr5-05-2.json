  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand for a native audience. Sentence structures follow typical Spanish patterns, and the dialogue format is preserved. Some minor awkwardness in phrasing (e.g., “señor” instead of “yo”) slightly reduces clarity, but overall comprehension is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation flows smoothly in most parts, but there are noticeable naturalness issues. Expressions like \"Es un comentario excelente\" or \"Se puede decir eso\" feel somewhat stilted. Verb tenses and article usage are mostly correct, yet occasional literal word‑for‑word phrasing (e.g., \"aprenderá francés a una velocidad increíble\") can sound unnatural to native listeners.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"grounding\" (translated as \"anclaje\") and \"memoria\". The terminology remains consistent throughout the script, and key concepts are explained adequately. Minor inconsistency in the word order for some phrases does not affect understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the original intent and humor of the podcast. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation was straightforward. However, some Spanish idiomatic nuances could be refined (e.g., \"consultor brillante\" vs. \"consultor excepcional\"), and a few colloquial turns could be more locally natural. Overall, the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French source are present in the Spanish version. The dialogue structure and speaker labels are preserved. The translation does not omit significant technical details or contextual cues. Slight re‑phrasing of some explanations may add redundancy, but this does not hinder understanding.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation achieves a solid level of comprehension and conveys the technical concepts accurately. It could benefit from more natural phrasing in a few places and a tighter editing to remove minor redundancies. Overall, it is a competent adaptation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience, though a few stylistic refinements would elevate the polish."
