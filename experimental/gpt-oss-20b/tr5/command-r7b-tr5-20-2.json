  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is hard to follow because of frequent repetition, abrupt shifts in speaker labels, missing punctuation, and incomplete sentences. Sentences are often fragmented or cut off, making it difficult for a Spanish reader to grasp the flow of the dialogue.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural phrasing and grammatical errors (e.g., \"Lucas: Exactamente.\", \"la ICL\", “Tech Linterna”). It also mixes French and English remnants, which reduces the natural flow for native Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, and *ventana de contexto* are present, but inconsistently used. The abbreviation *ICL* appears in English in several places, and terms like \"anchor\" are rendered as \"ancoraje\" with no explanation. Some terminology is correct but overall consistency and clarity suffer.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation does not fully capture the original intent. There are inserted explanatory notes (e.g., \"Primero, analizaré el texto...\"), mis‑spelled show titles (\"Tech Linterna\" instead of \"Tech Éclair\"), and non‑existent French fragments. Cultural adaptation is therefore weak, and the dialogue feels disjointed for the target audience.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Important portions of the original conversation are omitted or duplicated. Several lines are missing entirely, and the Spanish version includes extraneous commentary that was not present in the source. Consequently, key information is not conveyed accurately or concisely.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation exhibits a number of critical flaws—repeated text, mixed languages, grammatical errors, and inconsistent terminology. While some core concepts are retained, the overall quality is unsatisfactory for a professional Spanish audience. The dialogue is difficult to follow, and many essential details from the original French script are lost or distorted. A thorough rewrite is needed to achieve clear, fluent, and complete communication in Spanish."
