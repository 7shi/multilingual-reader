  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but several grammatical slips and odd phrasing (e.g., \"Imaginen\" instead of \"Imagínese\", \"Usted ha entendido todo\" being overly formal) slightly hinder smooth reading. Sentence structures are mostly correct, though the flow can feel abrupt in places where the original nuance is lost or awkwardly rendered.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Naturalness is compromised by a few unnatural expressions: the plural pronoun \"Imaginen\" where the dialogue is directed at a single person, the formal \"Usted\" in a conversational setting, and a repetition of the phrase \"Aprendizaje en contexto\". These quirks make the translation feel less fluid to native readers.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms are correctly translated: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\". The consistency and appropriateness of terminology are high, with only minor punctuation/spacing differences (e.g., \"preentrenamiento\" instead of \"pre-entrenamiento\").",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation largely preserves the intent and cultural tone, but the shift from informal French pronouns to formal Spanish ones (e.g., \"Usted\" vs. \"tú\") and the use of plural pronouns in a one‑to‑one dialogue reduce cultural congruence. Adaptation of idiomatic expressions could be improved for a more authentic listener experience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present, with no significant omissions or extraneous additions. The content stays concise while covering every segment of the dialogue, maintaining the logical progression of ideas.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the overall message and most technical details accurately, but it is marred by a few grammatical and stylistic errors that affect readability and fluency. A more careful attention to pronoun usage, formal/informal register, and natural phrasing would elevate the quality to a professional standard. The terminology remains solid, and the information completeness is strong, but contextual adaptation and fluency need refinement to fully meet the expectations of native Spanish speakers in a conversational podcast setting. Overall, the work is competent but would benefit from a thorough copy‑editing pass focused on naturalness and register consistency. The average score across criteria is 15.6 out of 20, reflecting a good but improvable translation effort."
