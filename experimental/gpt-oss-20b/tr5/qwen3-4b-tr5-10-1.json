    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely understandable and conveys the technical concepts, but it contains several linguistic inaccuracies and an unintended bullet‑point section that interrupts the flow. Spanish prepositions and idiomatic expressions need refinement, and all English terms should be fully translated for a polished result. With those adjustments, the text would achieve high quality in both readability and naturalness, but as it stands it falls short of perfect fluency and consistency. The overall evaluation reflects solid performance that would benefit from further editing to remove residual errors and improve naturalness for native Spanish speakers. Overall score: 15/20 (average)."
