  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is fragmented and often stops abruptly, making it hard for readers to follow the conversation. Key parts of the original dialogue are missing or replaced with placeholder text such as \"El texto no contiene una traducción en español…\". Consequently, the overall comprehensibility is severely impaired. 6/20.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains numerous unnatural repetitions (e.g., multiple \"Hola\", \"Hola mundo\"), incomplete sentences, and awkward phrasing that is not idiomatic Spanish. The flow feels disrupted and many words are misplaced or omitted, lowering the naturalness of the text. 4/20.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms like \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\" and \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" appear correctly, but many important terms are missing or mistranslated, such as \"In‑Context Learning (ICL)\" and the phrase \"contextual learning\". Additionally, some explanations are omitted or replaced by nonsensical placeholders. 7/20.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to adapt idiomatic expressions or cultural references for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Random interjections and placeholders break the narrative. There is no effort to align the tone or register with the target readership, so the contextual adaptation is minimal. 5/20.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are absent or replaced with placeholder sentences that do not convey the intended meaning. Key explanations about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and context memory are lost, leading to a very incomplete translation. 3/20.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely unusable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. It contains numerous omissions, repetitions, and placeholders that obscure the meaning of the original text. While some technical vocabulary is preserved, the lack of coherence, fluency, and completeness severely diminishes its effectiveness as a reliable translation. Significant revision and re‑translation are required to produce a quality, faithful version of the source material."
