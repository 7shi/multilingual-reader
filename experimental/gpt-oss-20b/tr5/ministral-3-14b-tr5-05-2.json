  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is mostly understandable to native readers, with clear sentence structure and logical flow. However, several phrasing choices feel forced (e.g., \"como para darle\" or \"Lo olvida todo\"). These quirks reduce readability slightly but do not render the text incomprehensible.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text generally sounds natural, but there are awkward expressions and minor grammatical slips. Using the English word \"prompt\" instead of a Spanish equivalent and the inconsistent use of hyphens in \"preentrenamiento/pre‑entrenamiento\" contribute to a slightly lower fluency rating.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are largely preserved: \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"fine‑tuning\" rendered as \"afinamiento\", \"In‑Context Learning\" as \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\", and \"memory\" as \"memoria\". Inconsistencies appear with the untranslated word \"Mémoire\" and the mixed use of \"prompt\". Overall terminology is accurate but could be more consistent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original intent for a Spanish‑speaking audience, keeping cultural references and humor. Minor cultural mismatches (e.g., keeping the French word \"Mémoire\" instead of translating it) and some over‑literal phrasing slightly detract from perfect adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is present, including the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning. A few details (such as the exact phrasing of \"prompt\" or the quotation marks around \"Mémoire\") are omitted or left in French, but the core information remains intact.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers a comprehensible and largely faithful rendition of the French original. It conveys the main concepts and narrative flow, yet it suffers from occasional awkward phrasing, inconsistent terminology, and the retention of some untranslated words. These issues slightly reduce the overall quality, but the text remains useful and readable for a Spanish audience. With minor refinements—especially in phrasing consistency and fully translating all terminology—the translation could reach a higher standard of fluency and precision."
