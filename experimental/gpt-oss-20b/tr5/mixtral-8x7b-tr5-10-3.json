  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish sentence is concise and straightforward, making it easy for a native reader to grasp the meaning. The wording follows a natural subject‑verb‑object order, and the key ideas (thanks, goodbye, next episode) are clearly expressed. Minor minor loss of a coordinating conjunction does not hinder comprehension. Score: 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The overall flow feels natural, but a few small issues slightly reduce fluency: the omission of the coordinating conjunction 'y' before 'hasta pronto' and the slightly awkward preposition 'para' instead of 'en' or 'al'. Despite these, the sentence sounds acceptable and would be easily understood by native speakers. Score: 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "All technical terms are correctly rendered: the podcast title is preserved, 'próximo episodio' is the standard phrase, and 'habernos escuchado' is idiomatic for 'nous avoir écoutés'. No terminology is missing or misinterpreted. Score: 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the friendly, informal tone of the original while staying appropriate for a technology podcast audience. The use of exclamation marks and the structure reflect the celebratory feel of the closing line. No cultural references were misaligned. Score: 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the same essential information as the source: thanks to listeners and a promise of a future episode. The only omission is the coordinating conjunction 'y', which does not alter the meaning. Overall, the content is complete and concise. Score: 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is clear, largely fluent, and technically accurate, successfully conveying the speaker’s gratitude and the call to return for the next episode. Minor stylistic tweaks—such as adding a coordinating conjunction and choosing a more idiomatic preposition—could raise the fluency even further. Overall, it is a solid, well‑executed translation suitable for the target audience and context. The overall score reflects its high quality while acknowledging the small improvements that could be made. Score: 17/20."
