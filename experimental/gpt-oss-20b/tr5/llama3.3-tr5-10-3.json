  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is easy to follow. The dialogue structure is preserved and the explanations of technical concepts are clear. The sentence flow is logical and the content is understandable for a general audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly natural but contains a few minor awkward expressions (e.g., \"solo se le ha proporcionado una pista\", \"para su conversación\" instead of \"para la conversación\"). Vocabulary choices are appropriate, though some wordings feel slightly literal. Overall, it sounds smooth to native Spanish speakers with only occasional stilted phrasing.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly translated and consistently used throughout the text. \"Preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"in‑context learning\" (as \"aprendizaje en contexto\") are all accurately rendered. Minor inconsistencies are negligible.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone, adapting idiomatic expressions where necessary. Some cultural references (e.g., \"consultor brillante\") are appropriate for Spanish-speaking audiences. A few expressions could be refined for better local resonance, but overall it works well.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French are present. No significant information is omitted, and the translation remains concise without unnecessary repetition. The explanatory notes are faithful to the source.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version is a solid and faithful translation of the French original. It accurately conveys the technical content and conversational tone while maintaining clarity. Minor fluency improvements would enhance naturalness, but overall the translation is of high quality and suitable for its target audience."
