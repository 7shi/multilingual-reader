  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is clear and logically structured. Sentence construction follows natural patterns, making complex concepts like pre‑training and in‑context learning understandable. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve flow, but overall readers can grasp the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for native Spanish speakers. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary. Occasional minor awkwardness (e.g., \"una expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo de la IA\" instead of the more idiomatic \"expansión masiva de la memoria a corto plazo de la IA\") does not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), etc. Consistency is maintained throughout. The abbreviation ICL is preserved, which aligns with common usage among AI practitioners.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects cultural norms and idiomatic expressions (e.g., comparing an expert to a seasoned consultant). It retains the informal conversational tone of the original. Minor localization opportunities (such as choosing between \"empiezan\" and \"comienzan\") were handled acceptably.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish version. No critical omissions were found, and the content remains concise while preserving essential details. Minor editorial adjustments could tighten redundancy but are not detrimental.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers a high‑quality Spanish rendition of the original French script. It maintains fidelity to content, uses suitable terminology, and preserves the dialogue’s informal, explanatory style. A few minor linguistic refinements could bring it to perfection, but it already stands as an excellent example of technical translation."
