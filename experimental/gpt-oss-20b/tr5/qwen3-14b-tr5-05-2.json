  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to read. The sentence structure follows the original closely and the dialogue format is preserved, making it straightforward for native speakers to follow the conversation. Some longer sentences could be split for added clarity, but overall comprehensibility is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, but there are a few awkward or slightly literal expressions (e.g., \"por lo tanto\" instead of the more common \"por tanto\", or the repetition of \"la IA\"/\"el modelo\" in a way that feels slightly mechanical). The vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, yet a few phrases could be smoothed out for better flow.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well. Terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *aprendizaje por transferencia* and *In‑Context Learning (ICL)* are correctly translated and consistently used throughout. Explanations accompany the terms when necessary, maintaining clarity for readers with different expertise levels.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone. Cultural nuances are respected, and the dialogue feels appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor improvements could be made to fully adapt idiomatic expressions (e.g., using \"proporcionar\" instead of \"dar\" in some places). Overall, contextual adaptation is good.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original is present; there are no omitted ideas or sentences. The translation remains concise and does not add unnecessary repetition. The only slight concern is that some explanations feel a bit redundant but this does not compromise clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation effectively conveys the content of the original French script. It maintains clarity, uses appropriate technical terminology, and preserves the conversational style. While a few phrases could be refined for smoother fluency, the overall quality is high and the translation is suitable for a native Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts."
