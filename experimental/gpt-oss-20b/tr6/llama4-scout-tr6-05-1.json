  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated dialogue is largely understandable, with clear sentence structures that mirror the original. However, some sentences contain minor grammatical slip‑ups (e.g., missing articles, slightly awkward phrasing) that can momentarily distract the reader. Overall, the text is readable but not flawless.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version reads smoothly in most places and uses contemporary vocabulary. A few constructions feel slightly stilted or carry punctuation mistakes (e.g., \"Entendido. Es como contratar…\" lacks a verb after \"es\") and there are occasional word choice inconsistencies. Nonetheless, it remains natural for native speakers.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"fine-tuning\" (as \"ajuste fino\" or \"afinamiento\"), \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"grounding\", \"memoria\". The only issue is the mixed use of \"afinamiento\" and \"ajuste fino\" for the same concept, which could confuse readers.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the tone and intent of a podcast conversation. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is straightforward. The Spanish version is appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience and does not require significant localization.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original is present. No major omissions or unwarranted additions were detected. Redundancy is minimal and the translation remains concise while preserving the dialogue structure.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the original dialogue while maintaining clarity and technical accuracy. Minor grammatical and stylistic refinements would elevate the text to perfection, but the current version is already suitable for a native Spanish audience in a podcast context."
