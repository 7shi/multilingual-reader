  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the overall narrative flow and most sentences are logically structured. However, a few constructions (e.g., “lo olvida todo”) feel slightly literal and could be phrased more naturally. Overall the content remains easily understandable for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly with only minor awkward phrasing such as “lo olvida todo” and “consecuencia.” Vocabulary choices are contemporary and appropriate, and the dialogue sounds natural to native speakers. Minor adjustments would enhance flow, but overall fluency is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated: “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “grounding”→“anclaje”. Explanations accompany terms where needed, and no key concept is omitted. The terminology aligns with common Spanish AI parlance.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Cultural adaptation is adequate: greetings and closing remarks suit Spanish‑speaking audiences. The translation keeps the informal, conversational tone of the original podcast. Minor cultural references remain unchanged but are understandable. Overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines are present; no significant omissions or additions that distort meaning. The translation remains concise, and redundancies are avoided while preserving clarity. The information from the original is fully conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is clear, fluent, and technically accurate, faithfully preserving the original's intent and nuance. Minor linguistic refinements could elevate the naturalness of some expressions, but the overall quality is strong and suitable for a native audience. The translation demonstrates a solid grasp of both content and language style, making it an effective localized version of the French source."
