  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "I cannot evaluate readability without the source and target texts. Readability depends on how clearly the translation conveys the meaning, how well sentence structures are adapted, and whether the target readers can understand the content without confusion.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Fluency assessment requires inspecting the actual wording and flow of the Spanish translation. Only then can I judge whether it sounds natural to native speakers or contains awkward phrasing. Without the text, I cannot score this criterion.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology evaluation demands that I examine how specialized terms from the French source are rendered in Spanish, whether they are accurate, consistent, and appropriately explained for the intended audience. This cannot be done without the texts.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Assessing contextual adaptation involves comparing the intent, tone, and cultural nuances of the original French text with those in the Spanish version. Without the documents, this assessment is impossible.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Information completeness can only be judged by comparing both texts to ensure no key points are omitted, added, or distorted. The absence of the content precludes such an evaluation.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "I am unable to evaluate the translation because neither the original French text nor its Spanish translation has been provided. Please supply both so that I can perform a thorough assessment according to the specified criteria. Thank you!"
