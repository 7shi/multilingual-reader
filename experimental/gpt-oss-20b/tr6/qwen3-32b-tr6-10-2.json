  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely comprehensible, with clear sentence structures and explanations of complex concepts. Minor issues such as repeated use of “por tanto” instead of the more natural “por lo tanto” and slightly clunky phrasing do not impede understanding. The overall flow is logical and easy to follow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation reads smoothly for most parts and uses contemporary vocabulary. However, some sentences feel slightly awkward (e.g., “enviar una IA completamente nueva a la escuela” and the repetition of “por tanto”). There are also minor grammatical inconsistencies that could be polished to sound more native.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly translated and consistently applied: “preentrenamiento,” “afinamiento,” “aprendizaje por transferencia,” “aprendizaje en contexto,” “ICL,” “ventana de contexto,” “anclaje.” The terminology aligns well with common Spanish AI terminology and is appropriate for a general audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and tone of the original French dialogue are preserved. Cultural adaptation is largely adequate, with idiomatic expressions such as “es como contratar a un consultor brillante” fitting the target audience. Minor adjustments could improve contextual nuance, but no major issues are present.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original is retained; there are no significant omissions. The translation provides adequate explanations for technical concepts and avoids unnecessary repetition, keeping the content concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation faithfully conveys the content and intent of the original French script. It is largely readable and uses appropriate terminology, though some phrasing feels slightly awkward or redundant. With minor polishing, it would be highly effective for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Overall quality is strong, earning an average score of 17/20 for the entire translation effort (85/100)."
