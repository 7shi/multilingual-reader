  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentence structure closely mirrors the French source, making it straightforward for a Spanish-speaking listener to grasp the technical concepts. Minor punctuation issues (missing accent in “¿Porque”) slightly reduce readability but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The overall flow feels natural, with idiomatic expressions such as “¡Hola y bienvenidos!” and “¡Una analogía perfecta!”. Occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., “proporcionarle los documentos de información exactos”) and a missing accent slightly detract from perfect fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently (pré‑entraînement → pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning → afinamiento, ICL → aprendizaje en contexto, grounding → anclaje). However, the phrase “mémoire à usage unique” was rendered as “memoria a corto plazo”, which misrepresents the original nuance, lowering the score.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the cultural context well: it uses familiar Spanish expressions and keeps the original’s conversational tone. The only significant adaptation issue is the mis‑translation of “mémoire à usage unique” as “memoria a corto plazo”, but otherwise it is well tailored to Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No substantive information is omitted. The dialogue retains all key points, explanations, and examples. The small semantic shift about the memory type is the only minor incompleteness, but it does not affect overall content understanding.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation accurately conveys the original French text, preserving its technical depth and conversational style. While it suffers from a few minor issues—most notably a missing accent and a slight mis‑translation of a key concept—it remains clear, fluent, and largely faithful. This makes it suitable for a professional audience without requiring significant revision."
