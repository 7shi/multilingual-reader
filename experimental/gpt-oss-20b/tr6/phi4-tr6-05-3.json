    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and follows the same narrative flow as the original. However, some sentences are slightly awkward (e.g., “aprendizaje In-Contexto” and “Recuerde el proyecto” in the middle of a paragraph) and the punctuation is occasionally inconsistent, which can interrupt the reader’s flow. Overall, the text is readable but could be smoother.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation uses a fairly natural register for a podcast script, but several phrases feel stilted or non‑idiomatic. Examples include “Aprendizaje In-Contexto”, “Se recorre” (instead of a more natural “se recorre”), and occasional missing accents. These issues lower the naturalness of the text, though the overall style is close to native speaker expectations.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently: pre‑entrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL. The translation sticks to the French original’s terminology without introducing unnecessary synonyms. The only minor issue is the awkward “Aprendizaje In‑Contexto”, which would be better rendered as “Aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”. Overall terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator has kept the intended tone and purpose of the original podcast dialogue. Cultural adaptation is generally adequate (e.g., using “consultor” instead of “consultante”), but some expressions could be more idiomatic for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The overall intent is preserved, but a few phrases feel directly translated rather than naturally localized.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present in the Spanish translation. No significant omissions are detected. Minor details (e.g., the exact phrase “Il n'est pas constamment affiné par vos conversations”) are paraphrased but still convey the same meaning. Redundancies are minimal and the text remains concise.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and captures the core content of the original French script. It conveys the technical concepts and the conversational flow well, though it suffers from some non‑idiomatic phrasing and occasional grammatical quirks that slightly hinder fluency. With a few refinements to sentence structure and terminology wording, the text would read more naturally for a native Spanish audience. Overall, it is a solid translation that could be polished to achieve a higher level of quality."
