  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is fragmented and contains large blocks of nonsensical tokens that break the flow. Where the Spanish appears, sentences are generally comprehensible, but the abrupt jumps, missing clauses, and garbled sections make it difficult for a reader to follow the narrative. Overall, the readability is moderate at best.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Apart from the garbled sections, the Spanish used is mostly grammatically correct but sometimes stilted. Certain expressions are awkward (e.g., \"la ventana de contexto\" instead of the more natural \"ventana de contexto\"), and the repetition of the same phrase with subtle variations creates a disjointed tone. Fluency suffers mainly due to the corrupted parts, so the score reflects a lower naturalness.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pré-entraînement*, *affinage*, *apprentissage en contexte*, and *grounding* are generally translated correctly (*pre-entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *anclaje*). However, consistency is lacking—sometimes the same concept is referred to with slightly different words (e.g., *aplicación* vs *aprender*), and some terms are omitted or lost in the corrupted sections. Thus, the terminology handling is acceptable but not flawless.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the core meaning of the original and does not attempt to adapt the content to a specific Spanish-speaking audience beyond literal rendering. Cultural references (e.g., the opening greeting) are preserved, but the overall adaptation is minimal. The presence of nonsensical content detracts from effectively conveying the intent, so the score reflects a modest level of adaptation.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original French script are missing or replaced by garbled token strings. Key dialogues, explanations, and even the main structure are lost. While the parts that remain are largely accurate, the omission of substantial content means the translation fails to provide a complete picture. Consequently, the completeness score is low.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation shows a basic understanding of the original text but is severely undermined by large sections of corrupted content. While many technical terms are translated correctly and the narrative flow is partially preserved, the presence of nonsensical token blocks makes the text unreadable in places and leads to significant information loss. A clean, faithful rewrite is needed to achieve an accurate, fluent, and complete Spanish version of the episode script. The current version would not serve a real audience without substantial revision and proofreading to remove the artifacts and fill in missing dialogues and explanations. The translation quality as a whole is therefore unsatisfactory and requires a major overhaul to meet any professional standard."
