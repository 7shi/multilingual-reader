  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and logical, with most sentences easy to follow. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., *su intercambios anteriores* instead of *sus intercambios anteriores*) slightly impede flow but do not obstruct comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall, the text reads naturally for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Some phrasing feels slightly stiff (e.g., *la IA no ha 'olvidado'* and *se le ha proporcionado una antisèche*). The mixture of English technical terms is acceptable, though the French word *antisèche* should have been translated.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms (*pre‑entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *grounding*, *in‑context learning*) are accurately rendered. Consistency is good, but the use of *antisèche* (a French word) is a minor misstep and could confuse readers.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original tone and structure while adapting idioms and cultural references appropriately. The dialogue format is preserved, and the explanations fit a general audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential points from the French original are present. The ICL abbreviation is kept, which mirrors the source. No critical information is omitted, though the explanation of *antisèche* could have been expanded for clarity.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is high‑quality, maintaining the original's clarity and intent. Minor grammatical issues and a single untranslated French word reduce the score slightly, but the overall readability, fluency, and technical accuracy are strong. With a few edits—especially replacing *antisèche* with a Spanish equivalent—the text would be almost flawless for native readers.\n\nTotal score: 90/100 (90%)"
