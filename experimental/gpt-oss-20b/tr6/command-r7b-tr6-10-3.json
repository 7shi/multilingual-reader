  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation contains several grammatical mistakes (e.g., \"el podcast en el que desciframos la tecnología que modelar nuestro mundo\"), awkward phrasing and inconsistent punctuation. While the overall idea is understandable, the sentence structure is often confusing, especially for non‑technical listeners. Thus readability is acceptable but not fluent.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Many expressions sound stilted or incorrectly translated, such as \"enraizamiento\" for \"grounding\" and the repeated insertion of “Traducción final”. Several sentences lack natural flow, with missing accents and verb agreement errors. Overall, the text does not read like native Spanish prose.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core terms like \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\" and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly rendered. However, other key terms are mistranslated or redundant (e.g., \"enraizamiento\" instead of \"anclaje\", repeated phrases). The consistency of terminology could be improved, especially in technical explanations.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely literal and fails to adapt idiomatic expressions or cultural references to Spanish‑speaking audiences. While the intent of the original is largely preserved, the lack of localization reduces the effectiveness of the communication.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translated version largely contains all the content from the French original, but it includes redundant sections and some omitted clarifications (e.g., the explanation about memory functions is truncated). The redundancy reduces conciseness, and a few explanatory sentences are missing or garbled, which slightly diminishes completeness.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the gist of the original but suffers from significant grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and occasional terminology mistakes. While it is readable enough for a general audience, the lack of fluency and contextual adaptation limits its professional quality. Refining the syntax, correcting mistranslated terms, and removing redundant sections would markedly improve the text. The current version is acceptable for a basic understanding but not for polished, native‑level communication in Spanish."
