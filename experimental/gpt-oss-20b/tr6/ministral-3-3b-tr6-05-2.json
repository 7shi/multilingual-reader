  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow, with clear sentence structure and most concepts translated correctly. Minor grammatical slips (e.g., gender mismatch “las nuevas **conocimientos**”) slightly hinder smooth reading, but overall readers can understand the dialogue without confusion.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation feels somewhat literal and occasionally awkward, such as “afinamiento” instead of the more common “ajuste fino” or “ajuste fino” and “aprendizaje contextual” instead of “aprendizaje en contexto”. Some phrasing (e.g., “reentrenar” for “re‑train”) is acceptable but not idiomatic, leading to a slightly stilted tone.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly accurate, but inconsistencies appear: “afinamiento” vs. “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje contextual” vs. “aprendizaje en contexto”, and “grounding” rendered as “anclaje” (acceptable but could be “enraizamiento” in some contexts). Overall, terminology remains comprehensible but not fully polished.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The intent of the original French is preserved; cultural references are neutral. However, some expressions remain too literal (e.g., “levantar el velo” is fine, but “desvelar la manera” could be smoother). The translation doesn’t fully adapt to Spanish idiomatic preferences, but it conveys the purpose.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present. No major omissions, and the added explanatory phrases help comprehension. Redundancies are minimal and the dialogue remains concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation achieves a solid basic transfer of meaning, keeping the dialogue understandable for Spanish readers. Nonetheless, several grammatical errors and slightly unnatural phrasing reduce the overall quality. A careful proof‑read and some idiomatic adjustments would bring the text to a near‑native level."
