  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version contains several grammatical and lexical mistakes (e.g., *bienvenido* instead of *bienvenidos a*, *antisèche* from French, *conocencias* misspelled), which make the text harder to read for native Spanish speakers. Sentence structure is sometimes awkward and not fully coherent, especially in long dialogues where the flow is broken by mis‑placed articles and word order problems. The core ideas are still traceable, but the readability suffers because the reader must constantly readjust to the errors.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text does not sound entirely natural. Phrases such as *se le ha dado una antisèche justo antes*, *la IA no 'olvida' en el sentido humano; su espacio de trabajo temporal simplemente se ha vaciado*, and *la IA no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus conversaciones* contain literal or awkward constructions that a native speaker would find jarring. Vocabulary choices are mostly correct, but several idiomatic expressions are either directly translated from French or not fully adapted, reducing the smoothness of the translation.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are mostly retained (*preentrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning* → *afinamiento*, *grounding* → *anclaje*, *context window* → *ventana de contexto*). However, some terminology is slightly off or inconsistently used: *conocencias* instead of *conocimientos*, *antisèche* (French word) used, and the explanation of ICL (“aprendizaje en contexto”) is slightly abbreviated. The overall terminology is acceptable but could be tightened for consistency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the general intent of the original but struggles with cultural adaptation. The opening line *¡Hola y bienvenido en* is ungrammatical for Spanish podcasts and lacks the appropriate preposition (*a*). Additionally, some phrasing such as *la IA no está constantemente afinada por sus conversaciones* deviates from the original nuance. Cultural references and idiomatic expressions could be refined to match Spanish listening habits more closely.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all of the original dialogue is present, but a few details are missing or misrepresented. The metaphor about *consultor brillante* is partially lost, and the nuance that the memory feature is a form of automated ICL is slightly muddled. Redundancy is generally avoided, yet some sentences are duplicated in meaning or missing the subtleties of the original explanation. Overall, the essential information is conveyed but not with perfect fidelity.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation shows a solid grasp of the source material but is undermined by numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and occasional lexical inaccuracies. While the main concepts are understood, the text would benefit from a thorough copy‑edit to improve readability, fluency, and contextual adaptation. A more careful review of terminology and the removal of literal French borrowings would raise the quality to a professional level. The translation is usable for a general audience but needs refinement for polished, native‑speaker standards.\n\nOverall, the translation achieves a moderate level of quality but falls short of a near‑perfect score due to the highlighted issues.\n\nOverall score: 12/20."
