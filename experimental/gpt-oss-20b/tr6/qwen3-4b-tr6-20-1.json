  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally easy to read and follows the same logical flow as the original. Minor typographical errors such as *conocences* and *informaciones* break the flow, and some gender‑neutral wording (*bienvenido/a*) feels clunky, but overall listeners would understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural in Spanish, with appropriate syntax and vocabulary. However, there are several awkward phrases—e.g., *El aprendizaje en contexto, es del cramar* (literally “is from cramming”), *le di un truco justo antes de que ella comenzara a hablar con ustedes*—which reduce the smoothness. These do not hinder comprehension but lower the overall fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: *preentrenamiento*, *fine-tuning*, *ICL (Aprendizaje en contexto)*, *grounding (anclaje)*. The translation keeps a consistent terminology, though the misspelling *conocences* and the plural *informaciones* could cause confusion. The core terms remain accurate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation preserves the podcast’s informal, conversational tone and keeps cultural references intact. The choice of *Hola y bienvenido/a* and the use of Spanish equivalents for *decryption* and *grounding* show good contextual adaptation. Minor issues—such as the gender‑neutral form and literal “practical trick” phrasing—are the only detractors.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the concept of memory, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. No substantive omissions, and the translation does not add extraneous material. Minor typographical errors do not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is a solid rendering that conveys the original meaning with good readability and terminology. Minor awkward phrasing and typographical errors slightly reduce fluency and clarity, but the overall quality is high. The translation would serve listeners well, though a brief proofreading would polish the final product."
