  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation follows the original structure closely and most sentences are understandable. However, some sentences are a little long and could be split for easier reading. Additionally, a few phrases such as \"Cuando abres una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío\" feel slightly abrupt. Overall, readers can grasp the content, but a few adjustments would improve flow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text generally reads smoothly, but there are several instances of awkward phrasing that could mislead native speakers: \"Lo han entendido todo\" (should be \"Lo has entendido todo\"), \"Se ha la impresión\" (should be \"Se tiene la impresión\"), and \"Se tiene la impresión\" is repeated unnecessarily. These small errors detract from the naturalness of the translation. Vocabulary is largely appropriate, though some technical terms are kept in English (e.g., \"fine‑tuning\").",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly correct: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\" (though \"fine‑tuning\" remains in English), \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\". The terms are consistent and the explanations match the original. A few minor inconsistencies: \"grounding\" is translated as \"anclaje\" (good), but the phrase \"memoria a corto plazo\" could be better expressed as \"memoria de corto plazo\". Overall, terminology handling is solid.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone, with the casual, conversational style preserved. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is straightforward. The Spanish version could benefit from slightly more idiomatic expressions (e.g., \"entender\" instead of \"entendido\" in some contexts), but it is otherwise well adapted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present. No significant omissions or additions that alter meaning. The translation does not add unnecessary repetition, and the flow of dialogue remains intact. Minor typographical errors (e.g., missing accents in a few words) do not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and conveys the main ideas effectively. It is readable and largely faithful to the source, but a few grammatical and stylistic corrections would elevate the quality to near‑perfect. Attention to agreement, article usage, and natural phrasing would improve the overall fluency and professional polish of the final version. The technical terms are handled correctly, and contextual adaptation is appropriate, making this a solid but not flawless translation. A final review focusing on natural Spanish idioms and minor grammatical fixes would bring it to a top score across all criteria. Good job overall, but a little polishing will make it shine.  "
