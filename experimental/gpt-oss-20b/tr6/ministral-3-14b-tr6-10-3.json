  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally easy to follow and the dialogue flow is preserved. However, a few sentences are a bit literal or slightly awkward (“es estudiar” instead of “es igual que estudiar”), which mildly hampers clarity. Score: 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most expressions sound natural, but there are some small grammatical slips (e.g., inconsistent pluralization “Pueden usar”, punctuation errors) that make parts feel slightly mechanical. Score: 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered – ajuste fino, preentrenamiento, aprendizaje en contexto, ventana de contexto – and remain consistent. The only minor issue is a hyphenation inconsistency. Score: 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version keeps the informal tone suitable for a podcast and respects cultural expectations. A few literal translations (e.g., “es estudiar” for “es cramming”) feel a touch mechanical, slightly reducing cultural adaptation. Score: 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present; no essential content is omitted and the translation remains concise. Minor punctuation details aside, completeness is high. Score: 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation faithfully conveys the original French content with a clear and engaging tone. While there are minor fluency and stylistic issues, the text is readable, technically accurate, and culturally appropriate for Spanish-speaking listeners. It maintains the essential information and preserves the conversational flow of the podcast dialogue. Overall, it is a solid translation that would serve well in a Spanish‑speaking context, with room for small refinements to improve naturalness and consistency. The average score is 17/20, reflecting a high quality translation with minor areas for improvement. (See detailed reasoning above.)"
