  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation uses clear sentences and explains technical concepts in an accessible way. However, some phrases (e.g., *una antisèche*, *apros*) are awkward or incorrect, slightly reducing clarity. The overall structure remains logical and easy to follow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences flow naturally for a Spanish-speaking audience. Nonetheless, the inclusion of a French loan word (*antisèche*), the use of *apros* instead of *apuros*, and a few literal word choices (e.g., *vaciar* “vaciar su espacio de trabajo temporal”) create occasional jarring moments. The overall naturalness is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms such as *pre-entrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *grounding* (anclaje), and *memory* (memoria) are consistently and appropriately rendered. The only questionable choice is the loan word *antisèche*. Explanations accompany technical terms where necessary. The terminology handling is largely correct.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the conversational tone and intent of the original French script. It adapts cultural references (e.g., *consultor brillante*) appropriately, though a few expressions could be more idiomatic in Spanish. The overall adaptation is faithful to the source context.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present. There are no significant omissions, and the added explanations aid comprehension. The translation remains concise and clear while retaining the essential content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely accurate and preserves the intent of the original French text. Minor issues with unnatural phrasing and a loan word affect fluency and readability slightly. Terminology is handled well, and the content is complete, making the translation a solid, though not perfect, adaptation for a Spanish-speaking audience. Overall, the translation demonstrates strong competency with room for minor refinement in naturalness and terminology consistency. The overall score is 16 out of 20, reflecting a good but not flawless translation. If a more polished version is required, focus on replacing non‑idiomatic expressions and avoiding unnecessary loan words would further enhance the quality. Overall score: 16/20."
