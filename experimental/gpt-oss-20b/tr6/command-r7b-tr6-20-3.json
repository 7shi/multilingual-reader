  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows a logical structure that mirrors the original dialogue. However, several sentences contain awkward phrasing (e.g., \"El aprendizaje en contexto es como aprender de memoria\"), occasional missing articles, and a few untranslated English words such as \"disappear.\" These minor issues slightly hinder clarity but do not prevent comprehension for a native reader. Consequently a score of 14/20 is justified.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the translation captures most of the dialogue, many expressions feel forced or unnatural. Repetition of the pronoun \"tú\" and the mix of formal and informal address break consistency. Words such as \"Aprendizaje In-Contexto\" are incorrectly formed, and the gender agreement for \"La IA\" is sometimes wrong (\"ella\" instead of \"él\" or \"la IA\"). Overall the prose sounds more like a literal rendering than a polished natural translation, warranting a score of 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms are largely preserved: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\". Nonetheless, some terms are misspelled or mistranslated (e.g., \"Aprendizaje In-Contexto\" instead of \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\"), and the term \"grounding\" is not consistently rendered as \"ancrage\" or \"grounding\". Additionally, the translation sometimes uses the same term in a different sense (e.g., \"memoria a corto plazo\" versus the original \"context window\"). Still, the overall terminology remains intelligible, deserving a score of 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the conversational tone and cultural references appropriate for Spanish-speaking listeners. However, some idiomatic expressions were not adapted (e.g., \"like cramming\" translated literally as \"como aprender de memoria\" instead of a more idiomatic Spanish equivalent). Also, the addition of unsolicited explanatory sentences that were not in the original text alters the pacing and can confuse listeners. These factors reduce the effectiveness of contextual adaptation, justifying a score of 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Essential information from the original script is largely present, but some lines are omitted or changed. For example, Luc’s original remark \"La IA n’est pas constamment affinée par vos conversations\" is translated correctly, but the Spanish version adds extra commentary that was not in the original (e.g., speculation about memory fading). Conversely, some segments are slightly truncated or misordered, leading to a small loss of nuance. Because of these omissions and additions, a score of 12/20 is appropriate.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is functional but contains several inaccuracies and stylistic issues. The translator retains most of the content and key technical terms, yet the fluency suffers from awkward phrasing, inconsistent pronoun use, and occasional literal translations. There are also unnecessary additions that slightly alter the original meaning. With some revision—especially polishing the naturalness, correcting terminology, and aligning pronouns—this translation could reach a higher quality level. As it stands, it is a competent but imperfect rendering that would be suitable for a quick understanding but may not satisfy an audience seeking a polished, native-like script for a professional podcast or publication. The overall quality is moderate, reflecting both strengths in content preservation and weaknesses in linguistic fluency and contextual fidelity."
