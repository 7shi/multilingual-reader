  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the conversational flow and logical sequence of the original French script. Sentences are generally clear and follow a natural order. Some compound sentences could be simplified for easier reading, but overall a native Spanish speaker would understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation reads smoothly, but a few phrases feel slightly literal or awkward (e.g., \"La IA no se afinada constantemente\" instead of \"La IA no se afina constantemente\"). There are minor grammatical inconsistencies and some punctuation errors that detract from perfect naturalness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia* and *aprendizaje en contexto* are used consistently and correctly. The term *grounding* is translated as *anclaje*, which is acceptable, though more common usage could be *fundamentación* or *apoyo contextual*. Overall terminology handling is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the informal tone suitable for a podcast introduction. Cultural references are minimal and appropriate. The adaptation is faithful, though occasional formatting differences (bold markers) are present but do not affect meaning. The Spanish expression \"¡Hola y bienvenidos!\" matches the original greeting well.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines are present and no key information is omitted. The structure mirrors the original, and explanatory paraphrases are provided where necessary. Redundancy is minimal and the translation remains concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is overall good, faithfully conveying the meaning, tone, and technical content of the original French script. Minor fluency and formatting issues are present but do not significantly impede comprehension. With small refinements to grammar and style, the Spanish version would be polished to a near‑perfect level. The overall quality is strong, suitable for native Spanish-speaking audiences in a podcast context. Overall score: 16.5/20 (average of individual criteria)."
