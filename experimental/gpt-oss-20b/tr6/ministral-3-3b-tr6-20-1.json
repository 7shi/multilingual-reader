  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and follows the original’s logical flow. However, several sentences suffer from missing punctuation, abrupt phrasing, and occasional literal phrasing that disrupts the natural reading rhythm (e.g., “La IA no se afinan constantemente” instead of “La IA no se afina constantemente”). These small issues reduce clarity but do not make the text incomprehensible.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most expressions sound correct, the translation contains noticeable grammatical mistakes (e.g., “La IA no se afinan” and repeated “Luc: Luc:”), awkward word choices (“es una forma astuta” instead of a more idiomatic “una forma inteligente”), and inconsistent capitalization (“ajuste fino”). Such errors interrupt the flow and make the text feel less polished for native listeners.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved (e.g., pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, ICL, grounding). Minor inconsistencies appear (“ajuste fino” vs. “ajuste fino”) and some terms are left untranslated or slightly altered, but overall the terminology is accurate and consistent with contemporary Spanish AI lexicon.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original to Spanish‑speaking audiences with appropriate cultural references (e.g., “consultor brillante”). However, a few expressions feel too literal (“la IA no se afinan constantemente”), and the abrupt “Luc: Luc:” breaks contextual flow. Still, the main intent and humor of the dialogue are preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all information from the French source is retained. The only noticeable omissions are minor clarifications that were inadvertently left out, such as a brief explanation of “IA no se afinan” which in the original was “la IA no se afina”. No major content is missing, and redundant segments are kept minimal.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the gist and many details of the original French dialogue, but it is hindered by a handful of grammatical, punctuation, and consistency errors. These issues slightly diminish readability and fluency, yet the overall meaning remains intact. With a few refinements—particularly correcting verb agreement, tightening punctuation, and smoothing awkward phrases—the translation could achieve a high level of naturalness and clarity for Spanish‑speaking listeners.\n\nOverall, the translation is competent but needs polishing to reach a professional standard suitable for a public podcast audience.\n\nScore (average of criteria): 15.8/20 ≈ 16/20.
