  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, but the inclusion of French terms such as \"El pré-entraînement\" disrupts the flow and can confuse readers who expect a fully Spanish terminology. Some sentences are long and contain mixed-language fragments, which slightly hinders comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall, the translation sounds fairly natural, yet there are several awkward expressions and a typographical error (‘rfine’ instead of ‘refina’). Some phrases feel literal and could be phrased more idiomatically, e.g., \"es una artimaña\" might be better as \"es un truco\". These issues reduce the smoothness of the text.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\". However, the persistent use of French lexical items (e.g., \"El pré-entraînement\") undermines consistency. Still, the terminology is understandable to a Spanish-speaking audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally preserves the conversational tone and intent of the original, but some culturally specific references (like the use of \"vuestras\" for a formal audience) could be adjusted. The adaptation could be improved by replacing literal translations with more natural Spanish expressions.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the main points and dialogue exchanges are present, and the translation does not omit any critical information. Minor wording variations exist, but the overall content remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent but not flawless. It effectively conveys the main ideas and maintains a conversational tone. However, the mix of French terminology, occasional typographical errors, and some literal phrasing reduce readability and fluency. With a few refinements—particularly removing the remaining French terms and polishing awkward expressions—the translation could reach a higher level of quality for Spanish-speaking audiences. Overall, it is a solid effort that would benefit from careful proofreading and contextual adjustments to achieve naturalness and consistency across all aspects of the text. 16/20 points."
