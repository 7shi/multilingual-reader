  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and the logical flow of the conversation is preserved. Some sentence structures feel slightly choppy (e.g., *«El preentrenamiento.»* and *«Ciertamente. Y este aprendizaje…»*), but overall readers can follow the technical explanations without major confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for most of the text, but there are a handful of unnatural phrasings and punctuation issues (e.g., *«El aprendizaje por transferencia es la clave. Imaginen que…»* instead of *«El aprendizaje por transferencia es la clave. Imaginen que…»*). Minor grammar slips and the use of brackets for the original quotation marks make it feel slightly mechanical. These issues lower the overall fluency slightly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms such as *pré-entraînement*, *fine-tuning*, *apprentissage par transfert*, *In-Context Learning (ICL)*, and *grounding* are correctly translated into *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino* (though *afinado* is used), *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, and *anclaje*. Terminology is largely consistent, but there are occasional mismatches (e.g., *«affinage»* → *«afinado»* instead of *«ajuste fino»*) and a missing clear reference to *grounding* as *anclaje*. Overall, technical language is understandable but not perfectly precise.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original tone and conversational style suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references are largely unchanged (the podcast name *Tech Éclair* remains). The script could benefit from slightly more natural idiomatic phrasing in a few spots, but the essential intent and humor are preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All main points from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No significant content was omitted. Minor variations in wording do not alter meaning, and the dialogue retains the same structure.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is overall good and conveys the original meaning accurately. It could be improved by smoothing out some phrasing, standardizing terminology (e.g., using *ajuste fino* for fine‑tuning), and polishing punctuation. With these refinements, the Spanish version would read more naturally while maintaining technical precision and contextual fidelity."
