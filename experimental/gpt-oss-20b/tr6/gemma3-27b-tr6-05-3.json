  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally easy to follow and the ideas are conveyed in a straightforward way. However, some sentences are awkwardly constructed, such as *«El aprendizaje en contexto es el memorizado»* and the repeated *«Lo olvida todo»*, which can momentarily confuse the reader. The logical flow is maintained but the readability suffers a little from these small issues.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural to a Spanish speaker, but there are several places where word choice and syntax feel stiff or incorrect. Phrases like *«es el memorizado»* and the occasional use of *«grounding»* in English parentheses break the flow. Additionally, the formal‑informal mix (using *usted* in some lines while the dialogue feels conversational) adds a touch of unnaturalness. Overall, fluency is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: *pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje* are all appropriate. The use of the French term *Mémoire* is questionable; a Spanish equivalent would be clearer. The consistency of term usage is generally good, with only minor lapses. The explanation of concepts is adequate and does not omit any key term.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the intent and the informal conversational tone of the original podcast script. Cultural adaptation is minimal, which is acceptable given the technical content. However, the repeated lines and some literal phrasing detract from a polished adaptation. The translator kept most idiomatic expressions intact but did not fully smooth out some unnatural constructions.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major information from the French original is present. There is no omission of concepts, and the dialogue structure is largely intact. The minor duplication of lines does not remove information but can create confusion. No additional content is inserted that alters meaning. Thus completeness is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the essential ideas and terminology of the original French podcast script and is largely intelligible to a Spanish-speaking audience. However, a few awkward phrasings, repeated lines, and the occasional use of English terms in parentheses slightly diminish readability and fluency. With minor revisions—removing duplicate lines, smoothing out stiff sentences, and replacing the French term *Mémoire* with a Spanish equivalent—the translation would reach a high professional standard. Overall, it is a competent, though not flawless, translation worth polishing for final publication or broadcast use. The average score is 17/20, indicating strong performance with room for fine‑tuning in style and consistency.\n\nReasoning for overall score: The average of the five criterion scores is (16+15+18+17+18)/5 = 16.8, which we round to 17/20. This reflects the translation's solid handling of technical content and context, while acknowledging minor issues that prevent it from achieving a perfect score. "
