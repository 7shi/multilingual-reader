    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and follows the same logical flow as the original. Sentences are mostly clear and concise, though a few compound sentences feel a bit heavy. Minor issues such as the double “proceso” in the opening sentence and a few missing accents (e.g., *aprenderá*) slightly affect readability, but overall a native reader can follow the discussion easily.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly in most places, but there are occasional unnatural choices: “Flash Tech” replaces the original brand name “Tech Éclair”; “Lo has comprendido todo” sounds forced instead of *Lo has entendido*; inconsistent capitalization of “Aprendizaje en Contexto” and “aprenderá el francés”. These quirks break the flow for a native speaker, but they are not so severe as to render the text difficult to read.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly – *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento* (here rendered as *afianzamiento*), *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *ventana de contexto*. The Spanish equivalents match the concepts and the terms are used consistently throughout. Minor variations (“afianzamiento” vs. “afinamiento”) are acceptable but could be standardized.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references are minimal, but the brand name change (“Flash Tech”) might confuse listeners familiar with the original. Otherwise, expressions are appropriately adapted to a Spanish-speaking audience, though some idiomatic phrasing could be smoothed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French source is present. The narrative structure, explanations of pretraining, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning are retained. No significant content is omitted, and redundant phrasing is largely avoided, except for a few repeated words in the first paragraph.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the essential meaning and structure of the original French script. It is mostly clear and well‑organized, with only a handful of awkward word choices and a brand‑name substitution that could mislead listeners. Technical terminology is accurate and consistent. For a polished final version, a few linguistic tweaks and a review of the brand name would improve fluency and authenticity. Overall, the translation is competent and functional for a Spanish‑speaking audience."
