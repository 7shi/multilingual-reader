  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and easy to follow. Long sentences are broken up in appropriate places, and the flow mirrors the conversational tone of the original. Minor readability hiccups arise from some slightly awkward phrasing (e.g., “enviar una IA completamente nueva a la escuela”) but these do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for most native speakers. However, a few expressions feel a bit literal or slightly formal (“la IA no se perfecciona constantemente con sus conversaciones”), and the use of the word “completamente” is uncommon in this context. Overall, the text sounds natural, but there is room for small stylistic adjustments.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are handled correctly: “pre-entrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “memoria a corto plazo”, “In-Context Learning”. The retention of the French word “ancrage” in quotes is acceptable, though “anclaje” would be a more idiomatic choice. Terminology is consistent throughout the passage.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and the informal, explanatory style suitable for a podcast audience. Cultural references are minimal and are appropriately translated (e.g., “ventana de chat” instead of “ventana de discusión”). The adaptation is faithful and engaging for Spanish-speaking listeners.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the French original is present; no major omissions. The passage includes the same explanations, examples, and clarifications. Redundancy is avoided, and the text remains concise while covering every key point.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the content, tone, and technical details of the original French script. Minor linguistic tweaks could improve naturalness, but the overall readability, terminology consistency, and contextual adaptation are excellent. The translation would be well-received by Spanish-speaking podcast audiences."
