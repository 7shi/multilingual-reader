  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text contains extensive repetitive nonsense fragments (e.g., “Skip Cartesian token” sequences) that break the flow and make comprehension impossible. Only a few coherent sentences remain, so overall readability is extremely low.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The presence of repeated, unrelated tokens makes the Spanish version feel disjointed and unnatural. Native speakers would immediately notice the garbled sections, and the remaining sentences feel abrupt and poorly constructed.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Some technical terms are translated correctly (e.g., ‘pre‑entrenamiento’, ‘afinamiento’, ‘aprendizaje en contexto’). However, because the surrounding context is corrupted, it is unclear whether these terms are used appropriately. Consistency is lost, and many key terms are omitted or obscured by the noise.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original conversational tone and cultural references are largely preserved in the fragments that remain, but the repeated nonsense tokens destroy the intended message. Consequently, the adaptation fails to convey the original intent to Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are missing or replaced by meaningless sequences. Crucial explanations about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and context‑learning are either truncated or rendered unintelligible, leading to significant omissions.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation suffers from severe corruption: a vast amount of unrelated text has replaced the intended content, resulting in a nearly unreadable version. While a few correct technical terms survive, the overall message is lost, making this an unusable translation for any Spanish‑speaking audience. Significant revision is required, starting with the removal of the nonsensical fragments and re‑translating the entire script faithfully and naturally. The current state does not meet basic quality standards for readability, fluency, or completeness. The translation quality is effectively zero for practical use, and it should be redone entirely rather than corrected in isolation. This evaluation reflects the need for a comprehensive rewrite and quality assurance before it can be considered acceptable."
