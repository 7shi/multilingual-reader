  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally easy to follow for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Sentences are logically ordered and the dialogue structure is preserved. Minor issues (e.g., “la IA lee una cantidad masiva de datos en Internet” could be phrased more naturally as “de Internet”) do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text is mostly fluent, but there are several points where the wording feels forced or incorrect. Examples include the misspelling “Buenos tardes” (should be “Buenas tardes”), the use of the less common verb “empollar” instead of a more idiomatic phrase, and the occasional awkward placement of modifiers. These affect the overall naturalness for native listeners.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: ‘preentrenamiento’, ‘afinamiento’, ‘aprendizaje por transferencia’, ‘ventana de contexto’, ‘memoria a corto plazo’. The translation of “grounding” as “enraizamiento” is literal and not the usual expression (commonly “anclaje” or “fundamentación”), but still understandable. Consistency is good across the dialogue.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent but some idiomatic choices feel off, such as “desciframos la tecnología” (could be “desentrañamos” or “exploramos”) and the mention of “empollar para un examen” which is not a standard Spanish idiom. Cultural adaptation is adequate overall, but a few expressions could be improved for a more native feel.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points of the original script are present, including the discussion of pretraining, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, memory features, and the concluding remarks. No significant content is omitted, and the dialogue flows through all segments.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the meaning of the original French script and preserves its structure and intent. While readability and terminology are strong, fluency and contextual adaptation could benefit from more natural phrasing and idiomatic choices. The overall quality is good, suitable for a general Spanish‑speaking audience with a few refinements needed for a polished, native‑level result. The average score across criteria is 16/20, reflecting a solid but improvable translation effort. This assessment should guide revisions to enhance fluency and cultural resonance while maintaining the informative content of the episode.  The final score out of 20 points is 16.0."
