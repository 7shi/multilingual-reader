  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to read. Sentence structures follow the source and most technical ideas are clearly expressed. A few small grammatical slips (e.g., “partes” instead of “partes de”) slightly hinder flow but do not obstruct comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall the translation sounds natural for a native Spanish speaker. Some expressions feel slightly mechanical or carry minor punctuation errors, e.g., the repeated quotation marks around ‘olvida’ and the odd placement of commas. These reduce the sense of smoothness by a point or two.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto* and *aprendizaje en contexto* are used accurately and consistently. Minor stylistic choice (*afinamiento* vs *ajuste fino*) could be noted, but overall terminology handling is correct.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the podcast style, keeps the name *Tech Éclair*, and adapts idiomatic expressions (e.g., the consultant analogy) for a Spanish audience. Cultural references are minimal, but the adaptation remains faithful and appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French script are present. No substantive omissions. The only gaps are typographical errors and the occasional missing question mark, which do not alter the conveyed information.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version is a strong, faithful translation that communicates the original content clearly. Minor grammatical and stylistic slips lower its naturalness slightly, but it remains comprehensible and technically accurate. With a few small edits for flow and punctuation it would reach a near‑perfect score. Overall, a quality translation suitable for native Spanish speakers and podcast listeners alike, though not without room for minor polish to eliminate the residual quirks noted in the evaluation. The average score across the five criteria is 18.8, which I round to 19 out of 20 for an overall assessment of the translation quality. This rating reflects the strong fidelity, clarity, and contextual adaptation of the text, tempered by the small errors that slightly detract from perfect fluency and readability. The translation would serve well for a Spanish‑speaking audience, and with a brief final review could be polished to near‑native fluency and error‑free quality."
