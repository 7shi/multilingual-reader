  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly understandable, but there are a few minor errors that interrupt flow – for example, the non‑existent word *descodificamos* and the misplaced preposition in *en un papel*. Overall sentence structure follows the original well, though occasional phrasing feels slightly clunky.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally reads smoothly, yet several typographical mistakes (*se rfine*, *descodificamos*) and some awkward turns (*en el contexto*, *en una conversación*) lower the naturalness for a native speaker. Minor grammar adjustments would raise the score.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto* and *grounding* (translated as *anclaje*) are consistently and correctly used. The abbreviation *ICL* is kept intact. Minor nuance – *grounding* could have been left in English for clarity – does not detract from accuracy.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue’s register and humor are preserved, and cultural references (e.g., closing with *¡Hasta pronto!*) fit Spanish audiences. A few phrases could be polished (*para el próximo episodio de « Tech Éclair »* could be *en el próximo episodio de Tech Éclair*), but the overall intent is conveyed faithfully.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No substantial content is omitted; all key points of the original French script are present. Minor stylistic changes do not alter meaning, and there is no unnecessary repetition beyond the normal conversational format.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the main ideas and technical nuances of the original French dialogue. It is understandable and largely faithful, though a handful of typographical errors and slightly awkward phrasings affect readability and fluency. With some proofreading and minor adjustments, the translation would be polished to a professional level."
