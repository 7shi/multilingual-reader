  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely easy to follow. Sentences are short and the logical flow from pre‑training to fine‑tuning and ICL is preserved. Minor readability hiccups arise from occasional punctuation errors (e.g., duplicated “Luc:” labels, missing colons, stray quotation marks) and a few awkward phrasing such as “La IA no se ajusta constantemente a través de tus conversaciones.” These do not obscure meaning but slightly interrupt the reading rhythm.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text mostly sounds natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The use of informal “tú” fits the podcast style. However, some expressions feel literal or slightly clunky: “entre bastidores” for “behind the scenes”, “se ajusta constantemente” for “continually learns”, and a hyphenated “pre‑entrenamiento” that is non‑standard in Spanish. Minor grammatical inconsistencies (missing accents, inconsistent punctuation) lower fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: “preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)”, “anclaje (grounding)”, “memoria”. The translation keeps the terminology consistent throughout the script. The only small issue is the hyphen in “pre‑entrenamiento”; the preferred form is “preentrenamiento”. Overall, terminology is appropriate and clear for a general audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts the original French tone to Spanish, retaining the conversational podcast style. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is largely straightforward. The translation could further localize some expressions (e.g., “un consultor brillante” could be “un consultor talentoso”) but overall the intent and purpose are conveyed well.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present: the stages of learning, the difference between temporary and permanent knowledge, the explanation of ICL and its limitations, the concept of automated memory, and the final reflective question. The only slight redundancy is the duplicated “Luc:” label, and there is no substantive omission of content.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and conveys the original meaning with minor lapses in punctuation, flow, and terminology formatting. It is readable, largely fluent, and technically accurate, making it useful for the intended podcast audience. Small editorial tweaks would elevate it to near‑perfect quality, but as it stands it fulfills the translation brief satisfactorily."
