    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is mostly clear and follows a logical structure that mirrors the French dialogue. Sentences are straightforward, and the explanation of concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning is understandable. Minor issues arise from some repetitive phrasing and occasional literal word choices that slightly hinder smooth reading, but overall the text is comprehensible to native Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural, with appropriate use of exclamation marks and conversational tone. However, a few expressions feel slightly literal or awkward – e.g., “El modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de tus conversaciones” could be phrased more fluidly as “El modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de tus conversaciones.” Some missing accents (e.g., “pérdida” in the original) are omitted. Overall, the fluency is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: pre‑training → pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning → afinamiento, in‑context learning → aprendizaje en contexto, grounding → anclaje. The hyphen in “pre‑entrenamiento” is acceptable but “preentrenamiento” is more idiomatic. Some terms such as “memoria a corto plazo” for the context window are appropriate. Terminology consistency is maintained throughout the script.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and conversational style suited for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Cultural references remain neutral, and the playful use of exclamations fits a podcast tone. Minor adjustments could better align idiomatic expressions, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines and key explanatory points from the French source are present. No substantive content has been omitted, and the script maintains the same length and structure. Redundancy is minimal and does not detract from clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the original French content with high fidelity. It is readable, largely fluent, and uses appropriate technical terminology. A few literal phrasings and minor stylistic adjustments could enhance naturalness, but the translation effectively communicates the intended meaning to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Overall, it is a solid, professional rendering suitable for a podcast script."
