  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to read and follows a logical flow that mirrors the original French dialogue. Sentences are long but coherent, and the use of simple conjunctions makes the script approachable for a broad audience. Minor issues arise with the occasional awkward pronoun choice (“ella” for IA) and slightly repetitive phrasing, but overall the comprehension level is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds fairly natural to a native Spanish speaker, but there are several minor grammatical slips and slightly clunky phrasing. For example, “la IA no ha « olvidado »” uses quotation marks unnecessarily, “Los nuevos conocimientos” should be used instead of “Las nuevas conocimientos”, and “Se puede tener una conversación larga” is slightly redundant. These issues reduce the overall smoothness, though the text remains understandable.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently and accurately: ‘preentrenamiento’, ‘ajuste fino’, ‘aprendizaje por transferencia’, ‘ventana de contexto’, ‘aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)’, ‘anclaje’, and ‘Memoria’. Explanations are provided where needed, and the terminology matches the level expected of a lay audience. No major terms are omitted or mistranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The script preserves the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural adaptation is appropriate for Spanish‑speaking listeners; idiomatic expressions are minimal, keeping the dialogue clear. Some stylistic choices could be further refined (e.g., avoiding the guillemets around verbs), but the overall contextual adaptation is strong.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present in the Spanish version. The translation does not omit any critical information, and redundancy is generally avoided. A small nuance about “no es constantemente afinada por sus conversaciones” is slightly rephrased, but the meaning remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, effectively conveying the technical content and conversational style of the original French script. While it is largely clear and accurate, a few grammatical corrections and smoother phrasing would bring it to an even higher standard."
