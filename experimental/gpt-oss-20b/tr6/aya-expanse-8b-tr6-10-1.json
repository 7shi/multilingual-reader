    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely comprehensible and follows the original structure, but the inclusion of meta‑tags such as “Luc afirma:” repeated twice and the occasional abrupt sentence fragments interrupt the flow. Readers can understand the gist but may be momentarily confused by these artifacts.",

    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly translated: pre‑entrenamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto (ICL), anclaje, ventana de contexto. Minor alternatives (ajuste fino instead of especialización) could improve precision, but overall terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts expressions to Spanish culture well, using idiomatic equivalents like “imagínense que enviamos a una IA…”. However, the repeated meta‑tags disrupt the conversational tone and deviate slightly from the original’s smooth dialogue. Overall, adaptation is good but imperfect.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present; no substantive content is omitted. The extra meta‑tags add redundancy rather than new information, but they do not cause loss of meaning. The text remains concise and clear overall.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates solid technical competence, retaining most terminology and the general flow of the original French script. Strengths include faithful rendering of key concepts (pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL, grounding) and a generally natural voice. Weaknesses stem from editorial mistakes – repeated meta‑tags, awkward phrasing, and occasional grammatical errors – which reduce readability and fluency. With minor cleanup and polishing, the translation would meet professional standards."
