    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and follows a logical sentence structure. The dialogue flow is preserved and complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in an understandable way. Minor issues include a slightly awkward phrasing in the line “enviar este graduado seguir una especialización” (missing a preposition) and the use of “tal” instead of “telle” in the translation of “Telle est la réalité de l'ICL.” These do not hinder comprehension, but they slightly affect the smoothness of the reading experience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Overall, the language reads naturally for a Spanish speaker. Word choices are appropriate and contemporary, and the text avoids most grammatical pitfalls. A few expressions feel slightly literal, such as “proporcionarle los documentos” (instead of “proporcionarle los documentos”) and “la memoria a corto plazo de IA” (missing the article). The erroneous abbreviation “ACL” instead of “ICL” is a notable slip but does not drastically reduce fluency.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately rendered: “pré-entraînement” → “preentrenamiento,” “affinage” → “afinamiento,” “In‑Context Learning” → “aprendizaje en contexto,” and “grounding” → “anclaje” (slightly expanded to “anclaje en el conocimiento”). Consistency is maintained throughout the dialogue. The only terminology mistake is the abbreviation “ACL” where “ICL” was intended.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and tone, adapting idiomatic expressions for a Spanish audience without losing meaning. Cultural nuances are respected (e.g., “consultant” → “consultor”). The only slight mismatch is the phrase “emergiendo” instead of “emergiendo” (both correct, but “emergiendo” is slightly more natural). The adaptation is effective overall.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All sections of the original transcript are present, and the dialogue flow is intact. No substantive information is omitted, and the translation provides the same level of detail. The small error in the abbreviation “ACL” does not constitute a loss of information but is a typographical oversight.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is a strong rendition of the original French dialogue. It maintains clarity, preserves technical terminology, and adapts contextual references well. Minor errors—chiefly a misplaced abbreviation and a few slightly awkward phrasings—do not significantly impede understanding. With slight refinements, this translation would reach near‑perfect quality for native Spanish speakers."
