    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the conversational flow of the original and is generally easy to follow.  Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in straightforward language.  Minor readability issues arise from a few awkward verb forms (“parte de un contexto vacío” instead of “parte de un contexto vacío”) and the insertion of commas where none are needed (“El aprendizaje en contexto, es el bachotaje”).  Overall, the text is understandable but could be polished slightly for smoother reading.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences read naturally for a Spanish speaker, and vocabulary is contemporary.  However, there are several small fluency problems: a misplaced comma after “contexto” in “El aprendizaje en contexto, es el bachotaje”; a slightly clunky phrase “cuando abres una nueva ventana, parte de un contexto vacío”; and occasional literal translations that feel less idiomatic (“se le ha integrado” instead of “se le ha añadido”).  These quirks interrupt the flow but do not prevent comprehension.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently and appropriately: “pre‑entrenamiento” → “entrenamiento previo”, “fine‑tuning” → “ajuste fino”, “ICL” → “aprendizaje en contexto”, and “context window” → “ventana de contexto”.  The translation keeps the terminology clear for a non‑specialist audience and provides brief explanations where needed.  No critical terms are omitted or mistranslated.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and tone, adapting cultural references appropriately.  Idiomatic expressions such as “contratar a un consultor brillante” mirror the original metaphor of a consultant.  Minor cultural adaptation could improve the phrase “parte de un contexto vacío” to “parte de un contexto vacío”, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue is present; no significant content is missing or duplicated.  The translation keeps the same structure and preserves key points such as the difference between temporary context and permanent fine‑tuned knowledge, and the nature of the new “memory” feature.  The only slight loss is the omission of a comma in “El aprendizaje en contexto, es el bachotaje” which does not alter meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is clear and largely faithful to the original.  It successfully conveys the technical concepts and conversational tone, with only minor fluency and stylistic issues that could be tightened.  For a general audience, the translation is adequate and easily understood, though a quick polish would raise it to a near‑perfect level."
