  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and follows the logical flow of the original. Sentence structures are mostly straightforward, making it easy for a native speaker to follow. Minor issues such as the repetition of the word “todas” in one line do not significantly hinder comprehension. Overall readability is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly fluent, but several awkward or incorrect expressions reduce naturalness. Examples include “Lo han entendido todo” (should be “Lo has entendido todo” in this context) and the erroneous word “antiche” (intended to be something like “anticipo” or “resumen”). These errors interrupt the flow for a native reader, lowering fluency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, anchoring, etc. The translation maintains consistency and uses Spanish equivalents that are appropriate for the target audience. The only terminology mistake is the invented “antiche.” Overall, terminology is well managed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation to Spanish preserves the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references are suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience, and idiomatic expressions like “es como contratar a un consultor brillante” fit naturally. However, a few phrases (e.g., “Lo han entendido todo”) feel slightly literal and could be smoother. Contextual adaptation is strong.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All points from the original script are present in the translation. No significant information is omitted, and the script remains concise while retaining clarity. The only issue is the incorrect word “antiche,” which momentarily obscures meaning but does not remove essential information. Overall completeness is very good.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and largely faithful to the original. It accurately conveys the technical concepts and conversational tone. However, a few linguistic inaccuracies—particularly the invented word “antiche” and some slightly awkward phrasing—reduce fluency. With minor corrections, the translation would be considered excellent for a native Spanish audience. The total score of 82/120 reflects these strengths and areas for improvement. The average per criterion is 16.4/20, indicating a good overall quality with room for polish in fluency and minor terminology errors. The translation successfully communicates the core ideas while maintaining a natural, engaging style for Spanish listeners, but it would benefit from a final proofreading to address the highlighted issues."
