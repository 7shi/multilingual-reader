  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable and follows the same logical flow as the original. However, some sentences feel cumbersome, such as the repetition in “El aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en contexto)” and the awkward structure of “Ustedes entendieron todo.” These issues mildly impede quick comprehension, especially for readers unfamiliar with the context.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the vocabulary is largely correct, several expressions feel non‑native or awkward. The use of the French word \"bachotage\" in a Spanish context is jarring, and the sentence structure in parts such as \"El aprendizaje en contexto es del bachotage\" lacks natural flow. These errors reduce the overall smoothness of the text.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly translated appropriately: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL\", \"anclaje\", \"memoria\". There is consistency in terminology, and the explanations are clear. Minor inconsistencies arise only from redundancy rather than misnaming.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the original tone and intent. Cultural references are preserved without unnecessary localization. Some phrasing could be more idiomatic, but the overall context and humor are maintained adequately.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original is present; no significant content is omitted. The translation sometimes repeats points for emphasis, which is acceptable, and it does not add irrelevant information. The text remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely faithful and covers all key points, but it suffers from several linguistic and stylistic issues that affect readability and naturalness. With some refinement in phrasing and removal of non‑native words, the quality could be elevated to a near‑perfect level. Currently, the translation is competent but would benefit from a polish to enhance flow and idiomatic expression for native Spanish speakers. Overall, it scores 15 out of 20, reflecting solid content with room for improvement in fluency and naturalness.  The average of the individual criteria gives a total score of 15/20, indicating a good but not exceptional translation.  The main recommendation is to adjust the flow and replace foreign borrowings with Spanish equivalents for better readability among the target audience."
