  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable; most sentences follow a logical order and the key concepts are expressed in plain language. However, some sentences are wordy or awkward (e.g., *“Cuando abren una nueva ventana, parten de un contexto vacío”*), which slightly hampers smooth comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds largely natural to a native speaker, but there are several places where the phrasing feels formal or slightly off‑tone. Examples include *“¡Hola y bienvenidos a « Tech Éclair », el podcast donde desciframos la tecnología que moldea nuestro mundo”* (missing exclamation, unnecessary quotation marks) and *“la IA no ha olvidado en el sentido humano del término; su espacio de trabajo temporal simplemente se ha vaciado”* (too literal). These issues lower the overall fluency score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled very well. *Pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL, anclaje* are all correctly translated and consistently used. The only minor slip is the occasional mixing of English parentheses (*grounding*) in a Spanish sentence, but this does not detract from comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator has largely preserved the conversational tone of the original podcast script. Cultural references are kept intact, but some expressions could be localized better (e.g., *“¡Hola y bienvenidos a « Tech Éclair »”* vs. a more colloquial greeting). Overall, the adaptation is adequate but could be tightened.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the flow of ideas remains intact. Minor stylistic changes do not affect the information conveyed.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid overall, accurately conveying the technical content and conversational style. Fluency and contextual adaptation could be improved with a bit more natural phrasing and localization, but the text is clear, well‑structured, and technically precise. It would be a reliable script for a Spanish‑speaking podcast audience with only minor polishing required. 17/20 is a fair overall assessment reflecting these strengths and small weaknesses, with an average score that indicates good but not perfect quality. 17/20"
