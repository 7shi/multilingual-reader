  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version uses clear sentence structures and explains concepts in an accessible way. Most idiomatic expressions are easy to follow, though some sentences are slightly clunky (e.g., *‘su área de trabajo temporal ha simplemente sido vacía’*). Overall, readers can grasp the content without confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker, with appropriate vocabulary and grammatical construction. Minor issues appear, such as the phrase *‘es una forma astucia’* and the slightly awkward wording of *‘ha simplemente sido vacía’*. These do not impede understanding, but they reduce naturalness slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely retained and correctly translated: *pré‑entraînement* → *pre‑entrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning* → *afinamiento*, *In‑Context Learning* → *aprendizaje en contexto*, *grounding* → *anclaje*. Terminology is consistent throughout the transcript, with no major omissions.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The conversational tone of the original is preserved, and cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish-speaking audience. The adaptation does not distort the intent of the hosts’ dialogue. A few phrasing choices (e.g., *‘se olvida todo’* vs. *‘se olvidará todo’*) could be refined, but overall the context remains intact.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present in the Spanish translation. No substantive content is omitted, and the transcript stays faithful to the original structure. Minor redundancies exist but do not detract from clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, effectively conveying the original French dialogue in Spanish. Readability and terminology are excellent; fluency and contextual adaptation are very good, with only minor stylistic tweaks needed. The translation remains faithful and complete, making it suitable for a native Spanish-speaking audience."
