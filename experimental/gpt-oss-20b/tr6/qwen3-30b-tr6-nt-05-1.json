  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "I cannot evaluate readability without seeing the target text and the source. The user did not provide either the original French passage or the Spanish translation. A meaningful assessment of readability would require an actual sample to examine sentence structure, clarity, and how well concepts are conveyed.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Fluency evaluation also requires the translated text to check for naturalness, grammar, and vocabulary. Without the text, I cannot judge whether it sounds smooth to a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Terminology appropriateness can only be judged if technical terms are visible in the translation. The user hasn't supplied the translation or the domain-specific vocabulary in question.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Assessing contextual adaptation necessitates the full passage to determine if intent, cultural references, and style are preserved. No text was provided.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Information completeness depends on comparing the source and target texts for omissions or additions. This cannot be done without both texts.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "The evaluation cannot be performed because the required texts (original French and its Spanish translation) were not included in the request. Please provide the specific passages you would like assessed, and I’ll gladly score each criterion and give detailed feedback."
