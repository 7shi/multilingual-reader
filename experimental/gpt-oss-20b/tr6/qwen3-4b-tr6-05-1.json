  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is largely understandable and follows a clear, logical sentence structure. Most concepts are expressed in plain language, and the dialogue flow is preserved. Minor issues such as missing accents and a few awkward word orders slightly reduce clarity, but overall readers can follow the conversation easily.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly in many places, but there are several spots where phrasing feels forced or unnatural. Examples include the use of “una ‘antisèche’” (mixing French slang), inconsistent punctuation, and occasional word order problems. These reduce the naturalness for a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms like *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia* and *ventana de contexto* are correctly rendered. However, the term *ancrage* is left untranslated, which is inconsistent. Additionally, the capitalization of *Memoria* and the French “Exactement !” inside the Spanish text undermine terminology consistency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the informal, conversational tone of a podcast and adapts idiomatic expressions appropriately for a Spanish-speaking audience. Cultural references are preserved and adapted sensibly, although a few literal phrasings could be improved for local flavor.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the original French script are present in the Spanish version. Minor omissions or inaccuracies are limited to the untranslated *ancrage* and the retained French interjections, which slightly affect completeness but do not remove essential information.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation faithfully conveys the main ideas and maintains the conversational style of the original. Some issues with untranslated terms, awkward phrasing, and minor punctuation errors affect fluency and terminology consistency. Nonetheless, the overall clarity and information are largely preserved, making it a competent, though improvable, translation."
