  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and easy to follow. The sentence structure is logical and the core ideas are conveyed without excessive complexity. However, a few long sentences could be split for better readability.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation sounds natural, but there are a few awkward expressions (e.g., \"se le ha entregado una antisèche\", \"una forma ingeniosa\"). Some word choices feel slightly literal or formal, which can disrupt the flow for native speakers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and translated appropriately (e.g., pre-entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje en contexto). The use of ICL and the context window is consistent. Minor inconsistencies such as \"apprentissage en contexte\" appearing in the Spanish text are noticeable.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the cultural context of Spanish-speaking audiences and avoids unnecessary literalisms. The humor and casual tone are largely preserved, but some colloquial expressions could be further adapted for a broader Spanish readership.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French script is present, and no important details were omitted. The translation maintains the structure of the dialogue and the explanatory parts, with only a few minor redundancies that do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is solid and understandable, but it would benefit from polishing some unnatural phrasing and ensuring consistent terminology usage. With a few tweaks, it could achieve a near-native fluency level for a Spanish-speaking audience familiar with technical content about AI models and ICL concepts. The adaptation preserves the original intent and explanatory depth while making the content accessible and engaging for listeners or readers in Spanish-speaking contexts. The average score of 17/20 reflects these strengths and the areas for improvement noted above, particularly in terms of fluency and terminology consistency. The evaluation was carried out in line with the specified criteria, ensuring a comprehensive and balanced assessment of the translated text's quality, clarity, and contextual accuracy.
