  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely clear and easy to understand for Spanish speakers. Sentences are straightforward and complex ideas (like pre‑training and in‑context learning) are explained without excessive jargon. Some minor structural oddities—e.g., “la IA es como un joven graduado universitario” instead of a more natural “un joven recién graduado”—do not impede comprehension. Overall, readers can follow the conversation smoothly.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally in Spanish, with appropriate punctuation, accent marks, and idiomatic usage. A few phrases feel slightly literal or stiff (“se ajusta constantemente a partir de tus conversaciones”), but they do not disrupt the flow. The dialogue maintains a conversational tone that fits the podcast context. Minor tweaks could improve smoothness, but the overall fluency is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled accurately and consistently: “preentrenamiento,” “afinamiento,” “aprendizaje por transferencia,” “aprendizaje en contexto (ICL).” The translator consistently uses Spanish equivalents for English terms, preserving the meaning. No significant terminology mistakes or omissions were detected.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts culturally appropriate elements (e.g., exclamation marks, colloquial style). The title “Tech Relámpago” matches the French “Tech Éclair” while sounding natural in Spanish. Expressions are generally faithful to the original intent, and no inappropriate cultural references appear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French transcript are present in the Spanish version. No significant content was omitted, and the conversation flow remains intact. The translation is concise and avoids unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is clear, technically accurate, and largely faithful to the original French podcast script. Minor stylistic refinements could enhance naturalness, but the overall quality is strong and suitable for native Spanish-speaking listeners seeking to understand the discussion about AI training concepts."
