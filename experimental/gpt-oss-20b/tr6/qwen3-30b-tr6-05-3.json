  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is fragmented and contains numerous abrupt interruptions (e.g., repeated \"Hola\", incomplete sentences, and out‑of‑place meta‑comments). As a result, a native Spanish reader would struggle to follow the logical flow of the dialogue, especially through the technical explanations. Therefore, the readability is limited but not zero, yielding a score of 10/20.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several sentences are ungrammatical or overly literal, and the text includes non‑native phrasings such as \"El texto traducido al español es el siguiente.\" The overall flow is stilted, with abrupt stops and starts. This reduces naturalness, so the fluency score is 8/20.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core terms such as \"preentrenamiento\" and \"ajuste fino\" are present, but the translation is inconsistent (e.g., \"aprender en contexto\" vs. \"aprendizaje en contexto\") and many technical points are omitted. Because of these gaps, the terminology handling is only moderate, earning 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to adapt cultural references or idiomatic expressions for a Spanish audience; instead, it inserts literal, meta‑textual commentary that is irrelevant to the content. This lack of contextual sensitivity results in a low score of 9/20.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are missing or garbled, including key explanations about transfer learning, in‑context learning, and memory features. The omission of these details leads to a very incomplete rendering, giving 7/20.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation provided is severely fragmented and incomplete. It contains many irrelevant interjections, lacks coherence, and fails to convey the technical depth of the original French dialogue. While some terminology is correct, the overall readability, fluency, and completeness are highly compromised. A significant revision is required to produce a clear, natural, and fully accurate translation."
