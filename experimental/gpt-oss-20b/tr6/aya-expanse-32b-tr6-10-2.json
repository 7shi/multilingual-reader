  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and uses clear sentence structures. Paragraph breaks and dialogue tags are preserved, making it straightforward for native readers to grasp the flow of conversation. Minor issues arise with a few long sentences that could be split for better clarity, but overall the text is comprehensible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly and uses appropriate Spanish idioms. Some small unnatural phrasings such as \"para la tarea a cumplir\" could be refined, but they do not impede understanding. The overall flow feels natural to a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL) and \"anclaje\". Consistency is maintained throughout the transcript, and explanations are included where helpful. The terminology aligns well with contemporary Spanish usage in the tech field.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone. Cultural references are adapted appropriately (e.g., \"Tech Relámpago\" mirrors \"Tech Éclair\"). Expressions are suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners, and no awkward cultural mismatches appear. The adaptation is effective and occasionally even more natural than the source.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines and explanations from the French source are present. No substantive information is omitted. Minor stylistic redundancies are avoided, and the content remains concise while conveying the same details.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation demonstrates strong fidelity to the source text, clear readability, and consistent technical terminology. While there is room for minor stylistic refinements, the overall quality is high and suitable for a native Spanish audience."
