  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable for a native audience. Sentences are coherent and the main ideas are conveyed clearly. However, some constructions are long or slightly awkward, which can momentarily disrupt the flow. Overall, readers can grasp the technical concepts without major confusion.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural phrasings and grammatical slips – e.g., \"Lo has entendido\" instead of a more idiomatic \"Lo has entendido\", the use of formal \"su\" in a conversational context, and the odd phrasing \"la integralidad del historial de su discusión\". These errors affect the smoothness of the text. Nonetheless, the majority of sentences read naturally enough for a competent Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"enraizamiento\". The word \"fine‑tuning\" is left in English, which is acceptable but could be translated as \"ajuste fino\" for consistency. Overall terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original tone and intent. Cultural adaptation is adequate, though the persistent use of the formal \"su\" instead of the more natural \"tu\" in a friendly podcast setting slightly detracts from authenticity. No major cultural missteps were made.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present in the Spanish version, and no critical details are omitted. Minor additions (e.g., clarifications on memory mechanisms) do not detract from conciseness. The overall message remains intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely faithful and conveys the intended meaning, but it could benefit from a cleanup of a few awkward phrases and grammatical errors. With minor polishing, the text would read smoothly and naturally to a Spanish-speaking audience while maintaining all technical nuances."
