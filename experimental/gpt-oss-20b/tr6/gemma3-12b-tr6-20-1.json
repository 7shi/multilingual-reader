  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is mostly easy to follow; the dialogue retains its conversational flow and the concepts are explained clearly. Minor issues include the use of a slash in “bienvenidos/as” and a slightly awkward phrasing in “partes de un contexto vacío” (better: “partes de un contexto vacío” or “estás partiendo de un contexto vacío”). Overall, the text is quite comprehensible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for most parts, but there are a few non‑native constructions: the slash in “bienvenidos/as”, the literal rendering of “fine‑tuning” as English, and a minor grammatical slip in “partes de un contexto vacío”. These do not obstruct understanding but slightly reduce the smoothness. Overall fluency is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely correct – “pre‑entrenamiento”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, “aprendizaje en contexto” – and the speaker‑style use of “grounding” is explained in Spanish as “anclaje”. However, the term “fine‑tuning” is left in English in a few places, and “grounding” is mentioned in parentheses. Consistency would be improved by fully translating these terms. Still, the essential technical vocabulary is preserved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and tone. Gender‑inclusive greetings (“bienvenidos/as”) are a nice touch for Spanish readers. Cultural references remain appropriate and the format of the podcast dialogue is preserved. Minor improvements could be made in phrasing, but overall contextual adaptation is good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All content from the French original is present. No significant omissions or additions that would distort meaning. Redundancy is minimal, and the translation remains concise while fully conveying the technical explanations.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is very good overall. It accurately conveys the original content and retains the conversational style of the podcast. Minor issues arise with terminology consistency and a few slightly awkward phrasings, but these do not impede comprehension. With a few small adjustments—especially fully translating “fine‑tuning” and smoothing some sentences—the Spanish version would reach a near‑perfect level of quality and naturalness for native readers of a technical podcast context. The translation is therefore solid and suitable for its intended audience, with only minor refinements needed to polish the final product. The overall score reflects the strong alignment with the original while acknowledging the small areas for improvement that have been identified above. Overall score: 17.5/20 (average of the individual criteria)."
