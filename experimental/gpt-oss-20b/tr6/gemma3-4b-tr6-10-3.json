    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the overall structure of the original French dialogue and most ideas are expressed clearly. However, some sentences feel clunky (e.g., \"aprende el francés a una velocidad increíble\" could be smoother) and the repetition of phrases such as \"aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto con ICL)\" breaks the flow. Overall, the text is understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience but could be more concise and natural. Score: 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural expressions and minor grammatical slips (e.g., \"Se puede decir eso\", \"aprendizaje en contexto es como estudiar para un examen rápido\"). Some word choices feel literal or stilted, and the use of the French word \"ancrage\" instead of a Spanish equivalent disrupts fluency. The overall register is conversational, but the sentence structures could be smoother. Score: 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", and \"memoria a corto plazo\" are correctly rendered. However, \"grounding\" is left as \"ancrage\" with no Spanish equivalent, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the French term. The consistency of terminology is otherwise acceptable. Score: 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps many Frenchisms (e.g., \"ancrage\", \"apertura de ventana\") that do not naturally fit Spanish idiom. Cultural references are largely preserved, but some expressions could be adapted to Spanish‑speaking contexts (e.g., using \"consultor\" instead of literal \"consultor brillante\"). The intent of the original is clear, but the adaptation could be smoother. Score: 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are present, and no essential information is omitted. The text is sometimes verbose, but it covers the same content and does not add unnecessary details. Score: 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the main ideas of the original French dialogue and maintains a conversational tone. Nevertheless, it suffers from several linguistic and stylistic issues: repetitive phrasing, occasional literal or awkward expressions, and the retention of French technical terms that should be adapted. The translation is largely comprehensible and faithful but would benefit from a revision to improve fluency, consistency, and cultural adaptation. Overall, the work is solid but not exemplary, indicating room for improvement in naturalness and terminology handling. Final overall score: 15/20."
