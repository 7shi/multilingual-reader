    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the dialogue flow and presents complex concepts in a generally clear manner. Some sentences, however, could be streamlined for better readability, e.g., “En lugar de reentrenar la IA para convertirla en una especialista.” The overall structure is logical and easy to follow.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly overall, but a few expressions feel slightly formal or awkward for spoken Spanish, such as “Usted lo ha entendido todo” and “En lugar de enviar un programa de formación”. These could be rendered more naturally as “Lo has entendido” and “en lugar de hacer un programa de formación”.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "All technical terms are correctly translated and consistently used: preentrenamiento, afinamiento, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto, anchoring (anclaje). The terminology aligns with common Spanish-language AI terminology and is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the original conversational tone and effectively conveys the intent. Cultural nuances are adequately addressed, though a few idiomatic choices could be refined (e.g., “el aprendizaje en contexto es memorizar para un examen”). Overall, the adaptation is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present, with no significant omissions. The translation includes the same examples, explanations, and analogies, maintaining the content's conciseness and clarity.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is high quality, faithfully reproducing the original's meaning, tone, and technical accuracy. Minor refinements in phrasing could enhance naturalness, but the text is clear, fluent, and technically sound for a Spanish-speaking audience familiar with AI concepts. Overall, the translation meets the high standards expected for professional, educational content in Spanish. The overall score reflects strong performance across all evaluated dimensions, with room for slight naturalness improvements. The translation is ready for publication with minimal polishing work required. The overall score is 18/20, based on the weighted average of the individual criteria scores. This indicates a professional-grade translation suitable for the target audience."
