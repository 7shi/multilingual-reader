    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and follows the original structure, making it easy for native readers to grasp the main ideas. However, some sentences are overly long or contain awkward phrasing that could impede smooth reading. There is also a slight lack of clarity in places where the French source used concise phrasing (e.g., \"Vea usted:\" and the double negative in the transfer‑learning example). Overall, the text is comprehensible but could benefit from tighter sentence construction.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the translation is largely grammatical, there are several unnatural or archaic expressions that break the flow for a native Spanish speaker. Examples include \"no enseñaríais\" (wrong conjugation), \"antes de que él no se ocupara\" (double negative), and \"Vea usted:\" (formal and out of place). The choice of \"ajuste fino\" for fine‑tuning is acceptable but the repeated use of \"enraizado\" for grounding feels forced. These issues lower the naturalness of the text. On the other hand, most sentences are syntactically correct and the overall tone remains conversational, so the score is moderate.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", and \"ICL\" are correct. The translator chose \"ajuste fino\" for \"fine‑tuning\", which is understandable though less common than \"afinamiento\". The word \"enraizado\" for \"grounding\" is technically correct but not idiomatic; \"anclaje\" would be more natural. Consistency is generally good, but occasional mis‑translations (e.g., the double negative in the transfer‑learning example) show a slight lapse in handling the terminology. Overall, terminology is handled well but could be polished.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and conversational style. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is limited. The main issue is that some expressions feel literal and lack the idiomatic flair expected in Spanish podcasts (e.g., \"Vea usted:\"). Despite these minor shortcomings, the core meaning and tone are preserved. The translator could improve by tailoring expressions to Spanish listening habits, but the adaptation is acceptable.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French source are present in the Spanish version: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. There is no noticeable omission of key ideas. Minor details, such as the explanation that the system searches past conversations to insert relevant excerpts, are retained. The translation does not add extraneous information and stays concise. Hence, the completeness is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the main ideas of the original French text and is largely understandable. However, several awkward phrasings, grammatical mistakes, and slightly non‑idiomatic terminology choices reduce the overall quality. A revision focusing on natural Spanish expression and consistent terminology would raise the translation to a higher level of fluency and readability while preserving the accurate technical content it currently achieves. Overall, the translation is good but still requires polish to reach professional standard for a podcast script aimed at Spanish‑speaking listeners. 12/20 points are assigned to each criterion based on the observed strengths and weaknesses, with an overall score of 13.5 out of 20 for the translation as a whole.
