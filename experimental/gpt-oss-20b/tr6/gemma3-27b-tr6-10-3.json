  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly easy to follow, with clear sentence structure and adequate explanations of technical concepts. Minor issues arise from literal phrasing in a few places (e.g., \"La IA no se ajusta constantemente a través de tus conversaciones\" feels slightly awkward), but overall the content remains comprehensible to a native Spanish reader.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally smooth, but there are a few unnatural expressions and untranslated English terms. For example, the word \"grounding\" is left in English, which disrupts flow. Phrases like \"Lo has entendido todo\" and \"Lo has entendido todo\" are correct but could be refined for better rhythm. Vocabulary choices are appropriate, yet occasional awkwardness reduces overall fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"ICL\" are accurately translated and used consistently. The only notable omission is the term \"grounding\", which remains untranslated, potentially confusing readers unfamiliar with the English term.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the conversational tone and adapts idiomatic expressions well (e.g., \"bachotage\" → \"estudiar intensamente\"). Cultural references are minimal, and the adaptation respects the target audience’s background. Overall, the intent and purpose of the original are effectively conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French script is retained. No major omissions are present. The only slight redundancy is the repetition of certain explanatory phrases, but they contribute to clarity. The translation remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation demonstrates a solid grasp of the source material and conveys the core concepts with clarity. While a few terminology inconsistencies and minor fluency issues appear, the overall quality is high, making the text suitable for a native Spanish audience seeking to understand AI training concepts. Minor revisions, particularly concerning untranslated terms like \"grounding\", would further polish the final version."
