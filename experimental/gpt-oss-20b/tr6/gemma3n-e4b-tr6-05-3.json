  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally clear and follows the original logical flow. Sentences are mostly concise, but occasional formal pronouns (“vuestras”) and a few minor syntactic slips slightly reduce smoothness. Overall, readers can understand the concepts without major effort.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally in Spanish, with most expressions sounding idiomatic. Minor awkwardities such as “el modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de vuestras conversaciones” and the use of the English abbreviation ICL in parentheses could be smoothed. No glaring grammatical errors are present, so the translation feels mostly fluent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core terms (pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, aprendizaje en contexto) are correctly rendered. However, the term “grounding” is left untranslated in one instance, which breaks consistency. Some technical words are not explicitly defined, but the context makes them understandable. The overall terminology handling is solid, with a minor lapse.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references appropriately; informal tone and conversational style match the original. Use of “vuestras” may feel slightly formal, but it does not hinder comprehension. The translator maintained the playful analogy (e.g., “hacer trampa”) which fits Spanish-speaking audiences. Contextual adaptation is good, with only a few minor stylistic choices that could be tweaked.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue turns and key content are preserved. A small typo (“se rfine” instead of “se refina”) and a missing period do not change the meaning, but the overall message remains intact. No significant omissions or additions were made, and redundancy is minimal.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the essence of the original French dialogue with a high degree of readability and naturalness. Minor issues in terminology consistency and occasional word choice slightly lower the score, but the text remains clear and faithful to the source. With a few refinements, it would be an excellent localized version."
