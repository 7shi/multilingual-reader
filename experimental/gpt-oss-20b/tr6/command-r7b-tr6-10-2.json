  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but the presence of duplicated passages and occasional formatting artefacts (e.g., repeated “**Traducción final:**” tags) disrupts the flow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured, yet the redundancy can confuse readers and reduce clarity.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adopts a natural register overall, but some expressions feel mechanical or slightly off—e.g., “Se puede decir eso” instead of a smoother alternative, and the repeated text makes the narrative feel choppy. The use of idiomatic Spanish is adequate, yet the artefacts detract from a seamless read.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"pré-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are correctly rendered. Minor inconsistencies appear (e.g., alternating between “ajuste fino” and “ajuste”), and the word “Memoria” is capitalized unnecessarily. Overall, terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and conversational tone, using culturally familiar expressions (e.g., “consultor brillante”). However, the unnecessary repetition and the insertion of formatting markers weaken the adaptation. The show title is preserved correctly as “Tech Éclair”. Overall, contextual adaptation is adequate but could be polished.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The majority of the original dialogue is preserved, including explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL, and memory features. No substantive content is omitted, though the duplicated passages add redundancy. The translation could be more concise by removing repeats, but the informational content is intact.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the core concepts and maintains the informal, explanatory style of the original French dialogue. Nevertheless, the presence of repeated segments and formatting artefacts disrupts readability and fluency. Terminology is handled well, and all key information is present. With minor cleanup—especially eliminating duplicate lines and polishing some phrasing—the translation would be near‑perfect."
