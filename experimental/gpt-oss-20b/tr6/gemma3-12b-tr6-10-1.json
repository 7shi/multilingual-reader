    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and follows a logical sentence structure. However, a few passages are slightly awkward—e.g., *“la IA no se está ajustando constantemente con sus conversaciones”* feels clunky, and the repetition of *“¡Exactamente!”* can interrupt the flow. Overall, readers can grasp the content, but minor rephrasing would improve clarity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally for most native Spanish speakers, but there are minor grammatical hiccups: *“la IA no se está ajustando constantemente”* should be *“la IA no se ajusta constantemente”*, and *“en el prompt”* is a direct borrowing that might be better rendered as *“en la petición”*. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary, but occasional literalisms slightly hinder smoothness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *grounding*, *ICL*. Consistency is maintained throughout, though *“grounding”* as *“ancaje”* could be more idiomatic (e.g., *“enraizamiento”*). Overall, terminology is accurate and clear for the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and tone, adapting cultural references appropriately for Spanish listeners. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., repeated exclamations) could be refined, but the overall narrative flow and conversational style are preserved.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French source is present. No key points are omitted, and the translation does not introduce irrelevant content. Redundancy is minimal, and the text remains concise while thorough.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and conveys the original message accurately. Minor grammatical and stylistic adjustments would elevate it to a near‑perfect level. The translator demonstrates good command of technical terminology and contextual adaptation, with only slight room for polish in fluency and readability aspects."
