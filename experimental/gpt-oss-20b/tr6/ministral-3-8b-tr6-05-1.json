  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and follows a logical flow. However, several sentences contain awkward word order or literal translations that make them feel clunky (e.g., *«le damos las informaciones de las que necesita…»* instead of *«le damos la información que necesita»*). Despite these small issues, the overall message remains clear to a Spanish‑speaking reader.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation often sounds slightly unnatural because of literal phrasing and occasional grammatical errors (e.g., *«en lugar de reentrenar la IA para convertirla en especialista»*). Vocabulary choices are largely appropriate, but the phrasing could be smoother and more idiomatic in many places. This reduces the fluency score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por contexto* (ICL), *transfer learning* and *grounding* are mostly correctly rendered. Nonetheless, there are inconsistencies—*aprendizaje en contexto* vs *aprendizaje por contexto*, use of *informaciones* (plural) instead of *información*, and an uncorrected French fragment *«Telle est la réalité de l'ICL»*. These inconsistencies slightly weaken terminology consistency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the core intent of the original French script and adapts most cultural references to Spanish contexts. Some expressions are literal and could be more natural (e.g., *«le damos la información que necesita…»*). Overall, the adaptation is adequate but could be polished for a more native feel.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The majority of the original dialogue is present, but there are notable omissions and inaccuracies: the line *«Telle est la réalité de l'ICL»* is left untranslated; *«Vous avez tout compris»* is rendered incorrectly; and a few sentence fragments are lost or mis‑translated. These gaps reduce the completeness score.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the essential ideas of the French source but suffers from several literal phrasings, grammatical slips, and missing or incorrectly rendered lines. While the content is largely present and understandable, the naturalness and precision of the language could be improved. With some editorial refinement—especially correcting the untranslated fragments, tightening the phrasing, and ensuring consistent terminology—the translation would reach a higher level of quality."
