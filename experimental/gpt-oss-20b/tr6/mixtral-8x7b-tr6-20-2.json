  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is heavily fragmented and interspersed with explanatory notes, incomplete sentences, and stray English fragments. Readers would struggle to follow the narrative flow, and many key ideas are broken across awkward line breaks. Overall readability is low, with only a few well‑structured passages. Score: 6/20.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains many unnatural expressions, literal literalisms, and odd word choices such as \"antiseche\" and \"recuerda\" in contexts that sound forced. Additionally, repeated use of the speaker’s name and stray comments disrupts the natural rhythm. The result is a disjointed, stilted read. Score: 5/20.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms like \"pré‑entraînement\" → \"pre‑entrenamiento\" and \"in‑context learning\" → \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are largely correct, but inconsistencies appear (e.g., \"afinación\" vs. \"afino\"), and many terms are not fully explained for a lay audience. Some specialized phrases are omitted or misrepresented. Score: 7/20.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to adapt idiomatic expressions and cultural references to Spanish‑speaking listeners. It also retains many English‑style interjections and meta‑commentary that break immersion. The overall tone is therefore mismatched to the target audience. Score: 5/20.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are missing or truncated; explanatory notes replace substantive content. Key ideas such as the distinction between fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are only partially preserved, leading to significant omission of information. Score: 4/20.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is markedly deficient in structure, fluency, and completeness. While some technical terms are correct, the overall rendering is fragmented, often incoherent, and filled with extraneous commentary. It would not serve a Spanish‑speaking audience effectively without substantial revision and re‑editing to eliminate the stray notes, correct awkward phrasing, and fully restore the original content. The result is a translation that is difficult to read, contains many errors, and omits essential information from the source text. Further work is required to produce a coherent, accurate, and culturally adapted Spanish version of the podcast script. Overall score: 5.5/20."
