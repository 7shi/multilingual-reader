    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely coherent and easy to follow. Dialogue is clearly separated, and the logical flow mirrors the original French script. However, a few sentences feel slightly awkward, such as the opening of the “ajuste fino” section (“El afinamiento...”). Overall, readers can understand the content without much effort.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds mostly natural to a native Spanish speaker. The use of everyday vocabulary and idiomatic expressions is appropriate. Minor issues arise with the alternation between “afinamiento” and “ajuste fino,” which may feel inconsistent, and some phrasing (“para convertirla en una especialista”) could be smoother. Nevertheless, the overall fluency is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento/ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL, anclaje, memoria. The terms are consistently used, except for the small inconsistency between “afinamiento” and “ajuste fino.” Explanations are provided where necessary (e.g., why transfer learning works). Terminology is appropriate for a general‑tech audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references are adapted appropriately (e.g., “consultor brillante” instead of literal “consultant”). The adaptation enhances readability for Spanish‑speaking listeners while staying faithful to the source.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines and key concepts from the French script are present. No important information is omitted, and the translation includes all explanations of learning phases and memory mechanisms. Redundancies are minimal and do not obscure meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, capturing the essence of the original French podcast. It remains faithful, clear, and largely fluent, with only minor inconsistencies in terminology usage and some slightly awkward phrasing. The overall score reflects a solid, well‑executed translation suitable for a general audience interested in AI technology."
