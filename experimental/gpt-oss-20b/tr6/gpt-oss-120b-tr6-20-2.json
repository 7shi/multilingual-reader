  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely clear and the sentences are logically ordered. Complex concepts such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning are conveyed in straightforward language. Minor syntactic quirks (e.g., “la misma información mañana” instead of “las mismas”) do not significantly hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker, with natural word order and idiomatic expressions. A few places feel slightly formal or carry the literal sense of the original (e.g., “una chuleta” for “antisèche”), but overall the style is natural and contemporary.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently translated (preentrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL). Where necessary, brief clarifications are provided (e.g., explaining fine‑tuning as ‘especialización’). The terminology aligns with common Spanish technical usage in AI.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the original tone and intent. Cultural references are appropriately localized (e.g., “consultor brillante” instead of literal “consultant”). Minor cultural adaptation such as switching to “ustedes” keeps the dialogue natural for Spanish‑speaking audiences.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No major content is omitted; the dialogue flow and explanatory segments are preserved. Redundancy is minimal, and the translated text remains concise while retaining all key points. The small grammatical slip (“las mismas información”) does not affect overall completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is accurate, clear, and largely natural. Minor grammatical and stylistic tweaks would bring it to perfection, but the overall quality is high and effectively conveys the original French content to a Spanish‑speaking audience with minimal loss of nuance or detail."
