  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue is easy to follow and the ideas are explained in a clear, linear fashion. Some sentences feel slightly literal or wordy, but overall the Spanish text is understandable for a general audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences read naturally for a native speaker. Minor awkwardness appears in expressions such as \"Tú lo has entendido todo\" or \"el sistema busca rápidamente\". No major grammatical errors, but the flow could be smoother in a few places.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly rendered: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL), \"anclaje\". The hyphen in \"pre-entrenamiento\" is omitted but acceptable. Terminology is consistent throughout the text.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone. Cultural adaptation is minimal, as the content is technical and universal. The Spanish wording is appropriate for a podcast audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French source are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory features. No major omissions, and redundant parts are not added.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid, maintaining accuracy and clear communication. A few minor stylistic tweaks could improve naturalness, but overall it is a high‑quality rendering."
