    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and follows the logical structure of the original. However, some sentences are slightly awkward or missing accent marks (e.g., \"tiene la idea de\" instead of \"no tiene idea de\"). The explanation of technical concepts is clear, but occasional literal translation leads to minor readability issues. Overall, the text is fairly easy to read.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several expressions feel unnatural or mechanical. Phrases such as \"en las sombras\" or \"El modelo mismo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de tus discusiones\" read oddly to a native speaker. Grammar and punctuation errors (missing accents, inconsistent capitalization) also affect fluency. Despite these issues, the translation still sounds conversational overall.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms are largely preserved: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine-tuning\" translated as \"afinado\" (though \"ajuste fino\" would be more idiomatic), \"In-Context Learning\" left as ICL, \"grounding\" as \"anclaje\". Consistency is good, and explanations for complex terms are included. Minor improvements could be made for more natural technical terminology.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the intent and tone of the original podcast. Cultural references are minimal and generally preserved. Some expressions could be better localized (e.g., \"para su nueva solicitud\" instead of \"para su nueva petición\"), but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant information is omitted. The content remains faithful, with no unnecessary repetition. Minor differences (e.g., slight rephrasing of certain sentences) do not affect meaning. The translation retains all key points from the original.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the core message and technical explanations of the original French text. While readability and fluency could benefit from polishing and more idiomatic phrasing, the terminology remains accurate and the information is complete. Overall, it is a solid translation that would be understood by native Spanish speakers, though some naturalness improvements are recommended."
