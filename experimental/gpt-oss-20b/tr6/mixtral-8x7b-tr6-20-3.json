  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text contains many fragmented sentences, misplaced quotation marks, and repetitive fragments that make it hard for a Spanish reader to follow the dialogue. Key concepts are often buried in long, confusing constructions. The overall flow is uneven, which reduces comprehensibility.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is replete with awkward phrasing (e.g., *« Il » en español*, *« En transférant »*, *« recuerda el contexto pasado»*), grammatical errors, and literal word‑for‑word transfers that do not sound natural to a native Spanish speaker. Some sentences are even syntactically incorrect or missing verb agreement.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pré-entraînement*, *fine‑tuning*, *in‑context learning* are inconsistently rendered. In several places the French words are left unchanged or incorrectly translated (e.g., *« Il »* for *Il*). Where terms appear, they lack proper contextual explanation and the chosen equivalents are sometimes nonsensical, which can mislead readers unfamiliar with the subject.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to adapt idiomatic expressions to Spanish. Cultural references and the conversational tone expected in a podcast are lost. The repeated use of *« Luc »* and *« Camille »* as direct quotes without proper punctuation further weakens contextual clarity.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several important parts of the original dialogue are omitted or misrepresented (e.g., the explanation of how memory works, the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge). Additionally, the text includes extraneous commentary that was not in the source. This leads to a partial and inaccurate transmission of the original content.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of poor quality. It demonstrates a lack of careful editing, consistent terminology, and natural Spanish expression. The result is confusing, incomplete, and unintelligible for a target audience. Significant revision is necessary to produce a faithful and fluent Spanish version of the original French podcast script. The translator should focus on correct technical terms, natural sentence flow, and proper contextual adaptation before attempting another draft. The overall score reflects these deficiencies and indicates a translation that falls short of professional standards for Spanish-speaking audiences. The translator should consider revising the entire passage with attention to grammar, consistency, and clarity to meet the expectations of native listeners and readers."
