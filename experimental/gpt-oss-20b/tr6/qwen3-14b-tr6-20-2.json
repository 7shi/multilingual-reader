    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable; the main ideas are conveyed clearly. The structure follows the original dialogue format, making it easy for a reader to follow. Minor issues with sentence flow (e.g., the comma in *El aprendizaje en contexto, es estudiar intensivamente*) slightly interrupt readability but do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly overall, but there are occasional unnatural constructions: *Imaginen que se envía una IA...* instead of *Imaginen que se envía una IA...* is correct but feels slightly literal; *informaciones* is used where *información* would be more natural. The use of the English term “cheat sheet” in a Spanish context is understandable yet informal. Punctuation errors (extra commas) reduce fluency slightly.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, and *in‑context learning* are correctly rendered. The translation keeps the original terminology consistent. The only deviation is the plural *informaciones* where singular *información* would be preferable, but overall the terminology is appropriate for a general audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the cultural context of Spanish‑speaking listeners. It keeps the informal, conversational tone of the podcast. However, some expressions could be further localized (e.g., replacing *cheat sheet* with *hoja de trucos*). The core intent of the original is preserved, and the adaptation is suitable for a Spanish audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue content from the original French transcript is present in the Spanish version. No significant omissions or additions that alter meaning were found. Redundancies were minimal, and the translation stays concise.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and largely faithful to the source text. It effectively conveys the technical concepts in a way that Spanish‑speaking listeners can grasp. Minor fluency issues and a few word‑choice corrections would polish the final version, but the overall quality is high."
