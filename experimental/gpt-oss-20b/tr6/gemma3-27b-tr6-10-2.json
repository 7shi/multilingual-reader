  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are logically ordered and the flow mirrors the original French dialogue. Some minor long sentences (e.g., the explanation of the memory‑window) could be split for additional clarity, but overall readers can grasp the concepts without confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is appropriate and contemporary. A few expressions feel slightly literal, such as \"un truco\" for \"une astuce\" and the phrase \"el espacio de trabajo temporal simplemente ha sido vaciado.\" These are understandable but could be phrased more naturally. Overall fluency is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", and \"Memoria\" are accurate. However, the term \"grounding\" is left untranslated, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the concept. Consistency is generally good.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references remain appropriate for Spanish-speaking audiences. Some idiomatic adjustments could improve naturalness, but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the consultant‑vs‑expert analogy. No essential information is omitted, and redundant sections are not unnecessarily expanded.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "This Spanish translation is of high quality. It captures the main ideas, keeps the dialogue natural, and handles most technical terms well. Minor issues include the untranslated term \"grounding\" and a few slightly literal expressions. With minor polishing, it would be a polished, publish‑ready translation suitable for a Spanish-speaking audience familiar with AI concepts."
