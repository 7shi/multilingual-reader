  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to read and the sentence structure follows the original French.  Some minor redundancies and missing articles slightly disrupt flow, but overall the narrative is logical and comprehensible to a native speaker.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most sentences sound natural and use contemporary vocabulary.  Occasional awkward phrasing such as \"El ajuste fino, en cambio, busca crear una habilidad permanente\" and the lack of an accent on \"preentrenamiento\" make the text feel a bit uneven.  However, overall it is smooth enough for native readers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are correctly translated: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"anclaje\".  Consistency is generally good, though capitalization of \"Aprendizaje en Contexto\" varies.  No major terminology mistakes were found.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation takes into account Spanish cultural and linguistic norms, using appropriate idioms and formal register.  Minor stylistic choices (e.g., \"se puede tener una conversación larga y detallada\") fit the target audience, but some phrases could be further localized.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French script are preserved; no critical content is omitted.  Minor details such as the exact phrasing of \"El modelo en sí no aprende ni evoluciona\" are retained, keeping the overall meaning intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation faithfully conveys the original content and technical concepts with good readability and fluency.  A few small errors and stylistic choices detract from polish, but native Spanish readers will understand the material without difficulty.  With minor refinements, this would be an excellent version for a Spanish-speaking audience of the podcast.\n\nOverall score: 17.2/20 (average of the five criteria)."
