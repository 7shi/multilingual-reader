  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the dialogue structure and uses clear, concise sentences that are easy to follow. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in plain Spanish, making the content accessible to a general audience. Minor instances of awkward wording (e.g., “preentrenamiento” instead of “pre‑entrenamiento”) do not impede comprehension, so a score of 18/20 is justified.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the text reads smoothly and sounds natural to a Spanish‑speaking listener. The dialogue maintains a conversational tone. However, the use of the formal pronoun “usted” in the line “Usted lo ha entendido todo” is inconsistent with the informal register of the rest of the conversation, creating a slight unnaturalness. Consequently, the fluency score is 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are consistently rendered in Spanish: ‘preentrenamiento’, ‘afinamiento’, ‘aprendizaje por transferencia’, ‘ventana de contexto’, ‘aprendizaje en contexto’, and ‘anclaje’ are all correct and widely understood. The hybrid “ICL (In‑Context Learning)” preserves the original acronym for clarity. No key terms are missing or mistranslated, so a 19/20 is appropriate.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the informal, friendly tone of a podcast conversation and adapts idiomatic expressions suitably. The slight mismatch in formality (use of ‘usted’) detracts a bit from the cultural adaptation, but overall the intent, humor, and explanatory style are well preserved. Score: 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogues and explanations from the original French are present in the Spanish version. No essential information is omitted, and redundant parts are avoided. Therefore, a perfect score of 20/20 is awarded.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is highly accurate and largely natural. Minor formal register inconsistencies slightly reduce the fluency, but the text remains clear, technically correct, and culturally appropriate. Overall, it is a strong translation that faithfully conveys the original meaning while being accessible to Spanish‑speaking audiences."
