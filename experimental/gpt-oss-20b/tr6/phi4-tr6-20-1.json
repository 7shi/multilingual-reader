  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to follow and the flow of ideas mirrors the French original. Some sentences are long and slightly awkward (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto es como el bachillerato de último momento”), but readers can still grasp the meaning. Minor article omissions (e.g., missing “un” before “bachillerato”) slightly reduce clarity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the translation reads fairly smoothly, several phrases feel literal or slightly stilted—such as “Tienes todo entendido” and “El aprendizaje en contexto es como el bachillerato de último momento.” These irregularities lower the naturalness for a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary is generally appropriate, but the overall flow could be smoother with more idiomatic phrasing.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly rendered: preentrenamiento, afinamiento (fine‑tuning), aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, ICL. Consistency is mostly maintained, though occasional misspellings (“preentrenamiento” vs “preentrenamiento”) are minor. Overall, terminology is suitable for a general audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator keeps the original intent and tone, adapting cultural references appropriately. Phrases such as “consultor brillante” and “consultor temporal” fit Spanish audience expectations. Minor literalisms persist but do not distort the context. The adaptation is largely effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No substantive content is omitted. The Spanish version covers all dialogue turns, explanations, and examples present in the French source. Some minor redundancy is removed, and the translation remains concise while preserving clarity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation successfully conveys the meaning of the original French text and is largely understandable. However, naturalness is occasionally hampered by literal phrasing and some small grammatical quirks. The technical terminology is accurate and consistent, and the overall adaptation respects the source’s intent and target audience. Minor refinements in fluency would raise the translation to an excellent level, but as it stands it meets a solid, professional standard for general comprehension and communication of the concepts discussed in the podcast transcript.\n\nOverall, the translation is functional and largely faithful, but a few stylistic adjustments would improve its polish and naturalness for native Spanish speakers.\n\nTotal score: 15 out of 20 points."
