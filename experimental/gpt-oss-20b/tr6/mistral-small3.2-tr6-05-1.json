  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally clear and easy to follow. Sentences are mostly well‑structured, and the dialogue format preserves the original flow. Minor issues such as repetitive wording (“una gran cantidad de datos en Internet”) and occasional clunky phrasing (“proporcionarle simplemente la documentación exacta”) slightly affect readability, but overall the audience can understand the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for native Spanish speakers and uses appropriate vocabulary. However, there are a few slightly awkward expressions – e.g., “en lugar de enviarlo a un programa de formación de varios años” and the singular/plural mismatch in “las informaciones” – which reduce fluency marginally. The overall tone remains conversational and smooth.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly and consistently. “Preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto” and “anclaje” all match standard Spanish usage. The term “ICL (In‑Context Learning)” is also retained, providing clarity for readers familiar with the abbreviation. No major terminology errors or omissions are present.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator has adapted idiomatic expressions and maintained cultural relevance, avoiding overly literal phrasing. The conversational style fits Spanish‑speaking audiences, and the use of “consultor brillante” and similar metaphors resonates culturally. Minor localization choices could be refined (e.g., smoother phrasing for “consultor brillante”), but overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French transcript are present in the Spanish version. No substantive information is omitted, and the translation preserves the sequence of ideas and explanations. The only small omission is the nuanced distinction in the phrase “sus conversaciones” versus “tus conversaciones,” which does not alter meaning. The translation is concise yet complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality, capturing the original meaning, tone, and technical nuance. While there are a few minor fluency issues and repetitive wording, the overall readability and terminology accuracy are strong. This makes the text accessible and engaging for Spanish‑speaking listeners, effectively conveying the original content and intent without significant loss or distortion."
