  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is highly fragmented and often lacks coherence. While basic ideas are present, the flow between sentences is interrupted by abrupt changes, missing context, and incomplete thoughts. Readers will struggle to follow the dialogue, especially when the original meaning is lost or garbled. The overall comprehensibility is therefore moderate to low.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains several unnatural expressions, such as 'se parece a un 'ancrage' que es 'grounding', but the Spanish translation uses 'ancrado' and then 'grounding' interchangeably. Grammatical errors, inconsistent verb tenses, and odd word choices (e.g., 'se parece a un 'ancrage'') break the natural flow for native speakers. The dialogue also feels disjointed, with missing transitions. Thus fluency is acceptable but not smooth.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms like \"pré-entraînement\" (pre‑training) and \"fine‑tuning\" are sometimes translated accurately (pree‑entrenamiento, afinamiento), but other key terms are inconsistently rendered or omitted. For instance, \"in‑context learning\" is translated as \"aprendizaje en contexto\" but later the word \"ICL\" is used without definition. Some domain terms such as \"grounding\" are left untranslated or partially translated. The terminology overall is partially correct but inconsistent and occasionally confusing.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator attempts to adapt the dialogue to a Spanish-speaking context, but the adaptation is uneven. Some cultural references remain untranslated or are not well contextualized (e.g., the phrase \"consultor brillante\" is okay, but the overall style feels more formal than the casual French original). The intended tone—informal yet informative—is partially preserved, yet the fragmented structure dilutes the communicative intent. The adaptation is thus acceptable but could be improved.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Significant portions of the original dialogue are missing or garbled. Sentences are abruptly cut off, and some key ideas (like the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge) are not fully conveyed. The translation often omits context, such as explanations about how memory works in ICL. Consequently, the overall content is incomplete and may mislead readers about the original meaning.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation exhibits many structural and linguistic issues that hinder readability and clarity. While some terminology is handled correctly, the overall coherence and completeness are below acceptable standards. The text requires substantial revision to accurately reflect the original dialogue and maintain natural, fluent Spanish suitable for the target audience. A comprehensive rewrite that corrects omissions, improves flow, and standardizes terminology would be necessary to achieve a professional translation quality. The average score indicates that this version falls short of a high‑quality translation, needing significant improvements across all evaluation criteria. The current version might serve as a rough draft but should not be considered final for publication or formal use. Score: 12/20. "
