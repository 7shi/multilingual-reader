  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version keeps the dialogic flow and follows the original’s sentence structure, making it easy for native readers to follow. Minor lexical choices such as “bachoter” or “cramming” may feel slightly informal or anglicized, but they do not hinder comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly overall, but there are a few awkward moments: the English word *cramming* is left untranslated, and the slang verb *bachoter* feels informal in a formal podcast script. Aside from these quirks, verb conjugations, prepositions, and punctuation are correctly used.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately rendered – *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *grounding* (anclaje), and *Memoria* are appropriate. The occasional plural “informaciones” instead of the singular “información” is a minor inconsistency but does not distort meaning.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the Spanish-speaking audience’s cultural context: expressions such as “consultor temporal” or “experto permanente” are idiomatic, and the script keeps the informal yet explanatory tone suitable for a podcast. No essential cultural adaptation was lost.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French original are present: pretraining, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features, and the final question about temporary vs. permanent knowledge. No substantive omissions are noted.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the Spanish translation is of high quality, preserving the dialogue’s clarity and technical content. Minor refinements—such as replacing the anglicized *cramming* with a Spanish equivalent and moderating informal slang—would elevate the naturalness to an excellent level. The script remains faithful to the original intent while being accessible to a Spanish‑speaking audience.\n\nOverall score: 18/20 (average of the five criteria). This reflects strong readability, good terminology, and completeness, with room for small fluency improvements.\n\nReasoning: The evaluation considered how well the translation communicates complex concepts, adheres to Spanish linguistic norms, maintains technical consistency, adapts culturally, and retains all original information. Scores were weighted equally across the five criteria, resulting in an overall average of 18.\n\nscore:18"
