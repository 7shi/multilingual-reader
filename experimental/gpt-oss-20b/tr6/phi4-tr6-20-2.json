  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version keeps the original dialogue structure and most sentence constructions are clear and logical. The target audience can easily follow the narrative and grasp the concepts. Minor awkwardness appears in a few longer sentences (e.g., *“Cuando comienza una nueva conversación, el sistema busca rápidamente en sus intercambios anteriores la información que parece relevante para su nueva solicitud.”*), but overall readability is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a native Spanish speaker, with appropriate idiomatic choices and minimal grammatical errors. Some expressions feel slightly literal (e.g., *“afinado”* for *fine‑tuning*), yet they do not impede comprehension. Overall fluency is strong.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: *preentrenamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *anclaje*. The word *afinado* is acceptable but could be replaced with *ajuste fino* or *afineamiento* for precision. Consistency is maintained across the script.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent, tone, and conversational style. Cultural references are minimal and do not require significant adaptation. The script remains suitable for Spanish‑speaking audiences without loss of meaning.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All parts of the original French text are present in the Spanish version; no substantial content was omitted. Minor wording adjustments (e.g., *“tendré que volver a proporcionarle”* instead of *“proporcionarle”*) do not affect the overall message. Redundancy is avoided and the content stays concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation faithfully conveys the original podcast script with clear explanations of AI concepts. While there are a few minor lexical choices that could be refined for greater precision, the overall quality is high, maintaining readability, fluency, and technical accuracy. The translator successfully adapted the material for a Spanish‑speaking audience without altering the original meaning or tone."
