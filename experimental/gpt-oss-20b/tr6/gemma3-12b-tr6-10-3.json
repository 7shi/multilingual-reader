  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and follows a logical sentence structure. However, occasional awkward phrasing (e.g., *estudiar a memoria*, *tú/usted* alternation) can slightly hinder flow for native readers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads smoothly in most places and uses contemporary vocabulary. Minor issues such as the inconsistent use of formal vs informal pronouns, and some literal translations (e.g., *estudiar a memoria*) reduce naturalness, but overall fluency remains high.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms – *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *ventana de contexto*, *grounding* – are correctly rendered. The choice of *ancaje* for grounding is acceptable and consistent. The retention of *prompt* in English is typical in Spanish technical discourse.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the original intent and tone, and cultural adaptation is largely respected. Minor issues arise from switching between *tú* and *usted*, which could confuse readers about formality levels. Overall, the adaptation is effective but could be refined for consistency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French source are present. No essential information is omitted, and the translation adds slight clarifications where helpful. The only small omissions are trivial (e.g., a missing comma in one sentence), which do not affect overall completeness.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation faithfully reproduces the content and technical nuances of the original French dialogue. It is readable and largely fluent, though a few phrases feel slightly literal or inconsistent in formality. Terminology is handled well, and the message remains intact. Minor stylistic polishing (e.g., consistent pronoun usage, more natural idioms) would elevate the text to a near‑native level. Overall, a high‑quality translation suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience of moderate to advanced technical understanding.\n\nScore: 16.4/20 (average of the five criteria)."
