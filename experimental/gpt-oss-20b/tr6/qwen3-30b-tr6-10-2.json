  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is fragmented, contains unrelated sentences (e.g., *“El perro corre en el parque.”*), and lacks the logical flow of the original dialogue. Readers would struggle to follow the discussion or grasp the key ideas about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning. Overall readability is severely impaired.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation includes repetitive interjections like *“Hola”*, abrupt transitions, and inconsistent use of Spanish tense and style. The prose does not read naturally; it sounds more like a machine‑generated or intentionally garbled output than a polished text. Fluency is therefore very low.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pré-entraînement*, *affinage*, *apprentissage par transfert*, *fenêtre de contexte*, *grounding*, *mémoire* are either omitted, incorrectly rendered, or replaced with unrelated phrases. The translation fails to preserve the specific terminology needed for a technical audience, resulting in confusion.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation does not convey the original intent or tone of a podcast introduction. Cultural references (e.g., the conversational framing with Camille and Luc) are lost, and the Spanish version offers no localized adaptation or explanatory context. It does not consider the target audience’s expectations.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Essential information from the original is missing: there is no mention of pre‑training content, the role of fine‑tuning, the concept of in‑context learning, or the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. The translation adds unrelated statements and omits the core narrative, making it incomplete.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "overall_comment": "The provided Spanish translation fails to meet basic quality standards. It is fragmented, lacks coherence, and misses all substantive content from the source. The text reads more like a nonsensical mix of phrases than a faithful or useful translation. For a reader expecting a clear, accurate, and natural Spanish version of the podcast transcript, this output would be highly unsatisfactory and unusable in its current form.\n\nOverall score: 2/20. The translation would require a complete rewrite to achieve acceptable readability, fluency, terminology accuracy, contextual adaptation, and information completeness."
