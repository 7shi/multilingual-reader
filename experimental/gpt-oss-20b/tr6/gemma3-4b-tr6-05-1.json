  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the overall narrative structure and is largely understandable to a native reader. Long sentences sometimes become unwieldy, especially where multiple clauses are combined, but this does not prevent comprehension. Minor issues such as the phrase “la IA se apoya en unas bases” feel slightly awkward, yet they do not block understanding. Overall, readability is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text flows smoothly in most places, but there are a few instances of unnatural wording: for example, “Ella todo olvida” instead of “Olvida todo”, and “la IA se apoya en unas bases” which feels slightly forced. The translator occasionally uses a literal literal rendition that does not match native idioms, but the overall tone remains conversational and suitable for a podcast audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: ‘ventana de contexto’, ‘grounding’ (anclaje) and ‘fine‑tuning’ (ajuste) are appropriate and consistently used. The only minor slip is the use of ‘ajuste’ instead of the more common ‘entrenamiento fino’ or ‘ajuste fino’ for fine‑tuning. Overall terminology is accurate and consistent, with only small room for improvement.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the informal, dialogue‑based style of the original French podcast. Cultural references are neutral and suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Some expressions could be more idiomatic (e.g., the repeated “Ella todo olvida”), but the intent and humor are preserved. The translator has not introduced culturally inappropriate content, so adaptation is largely successful.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory features, and the analogy of consultants vs. experts. No major omissions are visible, and redundant explanations are minimal. The translation remains concise and clear, with no unnecessary elaboration.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is a solid, comprehensible rendering of the original French script. It retains the conversational tone and most technical details accurately, with only minor fluency and wording issues that do not significantly hinder understanding. The translator has preserved the narrative structure and key analogies, making the content accessible to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Overall, the translation demonstrates good skill and attentiveness to the target language, though a few stylistic refinements could elevate the naturalness of the text even further. This is an excellent job that would serve a podcast listener well, with only a few spots for polishing in the future. Overall score: 16/20."
