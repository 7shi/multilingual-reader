  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable, but several sentences are fragmented or lack context, which can confuse readers. Key ideas are present, but occasional omissions and abrupt transitions reduce overall clarity.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While many sentences flow naturally, there are noticeable grammatical slips (e.g., *Lo han entendido todo* instead of *Lo has entendido todo*), untranslated French fragments (*en coulisses*), and inconsistent gender agreement. These reduce the naturalness of the text for a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre-entrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, and *aprendizaje en contexto* are mostly correctly rendered. However, some terms are inconsistently translated (e.g., *en revanche* left in French) and a few explanations are missing, which slightly undermines terminological precision.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapts cultural references in a few places (e.g., analogies with consultants and bicycles) but retains some French phrasing and occasionally fails to localize idioms. Overall, the intended tone and style are mostly preserved but could be tightened for Spanish audiences.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several lines from the original dialogue are omitted or only partially reproduced, leading to gaps in the narrative (e.g., missing explanatory sentences about the mechanism of *prompt* insertion and certain descriptive details). This omission reduces the informational fidelity of the translation.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the general sense of the original French dialogue but suffers from incomplete passages, occasional French remnants, and stylistic inconsistencies that affect readability and fluency. The technical terminology is largely correct, yet some key explanations are missing or poorly rendered. Overall, the text is usable but would benefit from a more careful revision to ensure full coherence and naturalness in Spanish. Score: 11/20."
