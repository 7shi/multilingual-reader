  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable, but several sentences are broken or overly long, which can interrupt the flow for a casual listener. The use of bold markers (* **) and inconsistent quotation marks creates visual clutter that detracts from readability.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Naturalness is compromised by occasional grammatical slips (e.g., \"la IA no se afinan\" instead of \"la IA no se afina\"), missing accents, and awkward prepositions. Some phrases feel translated word‑for‑word rather than adapted to Spanish idiom, reducing the overall smoothness.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)* are correctly rendered. However, the term *ICL* is introduced without a brief explanation of the acronym in Spanish, and the word *conocimiento* is mis‑gendered in one instance. Overall terminology handling is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The show title was changed from *Tech Éclair* to *Desglosando Tecnología*, which may confuse listeners familiar with the original branding. Cultural references remain largely intact, but the inconsistency in the title and occasional literal translations (e.g., “ajuste fino” without contextual framing) weaken the adaptation.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is preserved, including the explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, and in‑context learning. Minor omissions are negligible, but the abrupt insertion of “ajuste fino” as a standalone line slightly disrupts the narrative flow.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers the core ideas and most technical details, but its readability, fluency, and contextual fidelity suffer from inconsistent formatting, grammatical errors, and a misnamed title. With some editorial tightening and correction of the highlighted mistakes, the Spanish version would match the quality of the original French script more closely. Current quality can be classified as 'acceptable with revision needed.'"
