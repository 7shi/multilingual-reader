  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely understandable to a Spanish‑speaking audience. Sentences follow a logical order and key concepts are explained in plain language. However, some fragments contain awkward wording or unexpected language switches that can momentarily confuse the reader, lowering the score slightly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most of the translation reads smoothly, several passages are noticeably unnatural. The mix of French words (e.g., \"Tal est la réalité de l'ICL\", \"C'est incroyablement flexible\") and the abrupt insertion of English sentences (\"Precisely. The model itself…\") break the flow. Additionally, the use of slang such as \"chuletas\" may feel too informal in a podcast script context. These issues reduce overall fluency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms are generally handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" (as \"anclaje en el conocimiento\"). Minor inconsistencies exist (e.g., \"ICL\" vs. \"ICL\" spelled correctly, but some terms are duplicated in French). Overall terminology usage is acceptable but not flawless.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to adapt cultural references (e.g., consultant vs. consultant), but the inclusion of French fragments undermines this goal. The use of colloquial Spanish like \"chuletas\" may not suit all audiences. Therefore, contextual adaptation is somewhat compromised.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is present, but a significant section (the explanation about the model not learning from conversations) remains in English, effectively omitting that information for Spanish readers. Minor omissions and duplicated sentences slightly reduce completeness.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is mostly intelligible and covers the main points of the original French script. Nevertheless, it contains several problematic elements: unexpected language switches (French words inserted into Spanish, an English paragraph), informal slang that may not fit the podcast tone, and an incomplete translation of a key explanatory segment. These issues lower the overall quality. With careful revision—removing French fragments, translating the English portion, and smoothing awkward phrasing—the translation could reach a higher standard of fluency and completeness."
