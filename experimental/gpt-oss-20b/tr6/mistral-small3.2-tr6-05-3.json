    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and follows a logical sentence structure. Complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in straightforward language, which makes the content accessible to general readers. Some phrasing feels slightly clunky (e.g., *“El aprendizaje en contexto es empollar.”*), but overall readers can follow the narrative without confusion.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly fluent for a native Spanish speaker. However, there are a few unnatural expressions and grammatical slips: *empollar* is not idiomatic; *lo has captado todo* lacks a subject‑verb agreement in the original; and *la IA no se afinada constantemente* is missing a verb form. Vocabulary choices are generally appropriate, though some sentences feel wordy or awkward, lowering the naturalness slightly.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, and *grounding* are translated correctly. Inconsistencies arise with *afinamiento* vs. *ajuste fino* and *anclaje* vs. *grounding*, but overall terminology is appropriate for a lay audience and consistent within each segment.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the original intent and adapts idiomatic expressions to Spanish where possible (e.g., *consultor brillante* instead of a literal *bright consultant*). Cultural references are minimal, and the text avoids direct mistranslations. Some expressions could be better localized (*empollar* would be replaced with a more common Spanish idiom), but overall the context is well preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French script is present. No key concepts or dialogues are omitted. The translation includes every major point about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, memory features, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. The text is concise, though a few redundancies (e.g., repeating *la IA no se afinada* twice) could be trimmed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is clear, mostly fluent, and retains the technical content and intent of the original French script. Minor linguistic adjustments—especially replacing *empollar* with a more natural phrase, correcting verb agreements, and tightening some repetitive sentences—would elevate the quality to near‑native level. With these tweaks, the translation would serve as a polished, reader‑friendly rendition."
