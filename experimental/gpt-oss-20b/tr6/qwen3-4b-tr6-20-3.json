  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely comprehensible and follows the narrative structure of the original. However, several long sentences are not broken up, and some word choices feel slightly literal (e.g., “una IA completamente nueva a la escuela”). Additionally, a few grammatical errors (“de esta enfoque” instead of “de este enfoque”) reduce clarity. Overall, readers can understand the content but would benefit from smoother sentence construction.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text often reads like a literal translation and contains awkward phrasing such as “le proporcionar” instead of “proporcionarle” and an unnecessary space before exclamation marks. Accents are missing on words like “más” and “más” and there are a few typographical errors (e.g., “conocencias” instead of “conocimientos”). These issues hinder the natural flow for a native Spanish speaker, leading to a fluency score that is lower than ideal.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally preserved (“preentrenamiento”, “fine‑tuning”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “grounding”). Consistency is good, but a few mistakes (e.g., “conocencias”) indicate a lack of attention to correct terminology. The explanation of concepts is adequate, so the terminology is acceptable but not flawless.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and conversational tone, addressing a Spanish-speaking audience. Cultural references are minimal and thus not problematic. Minor awkwardness in some expressions and the literalness of certain phrases slightly diminish adaptation, but overall the cultural context is respected.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The content is almost entirely retained; no major ideas are omitted. Redundancies are minimal and the core messages are conveyed. Small errors do not lead to significant loss of information, so completeness is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the overall meaning and narrative flow of the original French podcast script, but it suffers from a number of grammatical mistakes, awkward phrasing, and a few lexical inaccuracies that affect readability and fluency. While technical terminology is mostly handled correctly, the overall naturalness and polish would need improvement to meet a high-quality standard for native Spanish speakers. The translation is useful but would benefit from a thorough copy‑editing pass to correct errors and refine style before final publication or broadcast.\n\nAverage Score: 14/20 (out of 20)."
