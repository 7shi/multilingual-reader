  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated dialogue is mostly clear and easy to follow for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Sentences are structured logically, and the overall flow mirrors the original French script. The use of simple vocabulary for explanations of concepts like pre‑entrenamiento and ICL makes the text approachable. A few minor syntactic slips (e.g., “partes de un contexto vacío”) slightly disrupt readability but do not prevent understanding.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds fairly natural overall, but several expressions are slightly awkward or literal, such as \"Cuando abres una nueva ventana, partes de un contexto vacío\" (the verb usage is off), \"Se tiene la impresión de que ellas comienzan realmente a recordar las cosas\" (could be smoother), and a mix of English terms (prompt) with Spanish. These issues mildly hinder smoothness for native listeners. The vocabulary is contemporary, yet some phrasing feels stilted or overly formal.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, ICL, anclaje, prompt. The translation keeps the same terminology as the original, aiding comprehension for a tech‑savvy audience. No major mistranslations or omissions occur. The only minor issue is the occasional use of the English word \"prompt\" instead of a fully Spanish equivalent, but this is acceptable in the tech context.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue keeps the original intent and style, preserving the conversational tone. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is straightforward. The translator retains the French expressions of enthusiasm and explanation without adding unnecessary localization, which is appropriate. Some phrasing could be slightly tuned to Spanish idioms, but overall the adaptation is faithful and clear.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All lines from the original French script are present in the Spanish version. No key points are omitted, and the explanation of pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning, and ICL is fully retained. The translation does not add extraneous content, and redundancy is minimal. The only potential loss is in the awkward phrasing that could obscure a small detail, but overall completeness is excellent.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation delivers the essential content and keeps the conversational flow of the original French script. It is largely comprehensible and uses appropriate technical terminology. However, some syntactic and stylistic issues slightly affect fluency, particularly in a few literal or awkward sentences. With minor adjustments for natural phrasing, the translation would reach a near‑perfect score across all criteria. Overall, it is a solid translation suitable for Spanish‑speaking audiences interested in AI concepts, but polishing the flow would enhance the listener experience.  Overall score: 17/20 (weighted average of the criteria)."
