  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated script is generally understandable for a Spanish‑speaking audience, with clear explanations of the key concepts. Sentences are reasonably short and logical, but a few lines suffer from minor confusion due to language mixing (e.g., \"C'est donc una memoria…\"). Overall, readers can follow the conversation without major difficulty.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text flows well for the most part, but there are a handful of unnatural or incorrectly mixed expressions such as \"C'est donc una memoria\" and \"Merci por escucharnos\". These errors interrupt the naturalness of the dialogue and would feel jarring to native speakers. Vocabulary choices are appropriate, but the occasional French‑Spanish hybrid reduces overall fluency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprender por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"in‑context learning\" and \"anclaje\" are used appropriately. The English term \"prompt\" is retained, which is acceptable in the context of AI discussions. The consistency of terminology is good, though a few terms (e.g., \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\") could have been explained more explicitly for non‑technical listeners.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the conversational tone of the original podcast and adapts idiomatic expressions suitably for a Latin‑American audience. Cultural references remain neutral and the content is adapted to Spanish without losing the intent. The only issue is the mixing of French fragments, which slightly hampers contextual adaptation but does not distort the meaning.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present in the translation: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory mechanisms, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No significant information is omitted, and redundancies are minimal. Minor textual errors do not affect the conveyed information.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely faithful and clear, conveying the core concepts of AI training to a Spanish audience. It succeeds in maintaining the informal, explanatory style of the original podcast. However, the presence of mixed French‑Spanish phrases and a few awkward word choices reduce the overall quality. With a few revisions to remove the language blends and polish a couple of sentences, the translation would reach a higher standard of naturalness and precision. Overall, it is a solid effort that meets most of the evaluation criteria, but it is not yet perfect for a polished publication or broadcast. The final score reflects this balanced assessment: the translation is good but not flawless, achieving a score of 16 out of 20."
