  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely comprehensible and follows the original dialogue structure. However, several sentences contain awkward word order or literal translations that make the flow less smooth (e.g., *«la forma en que la IA “almacena temporalmente” estas informaciones es a menudo mal comprendida»*). The overall sense is clear but a few phrasing choices reduce readability.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several grammatical slips and unnatural expressions. Examples include the abbreviation *AIC* (which does not correspond to ICL), the phrase *«estudiar a la carrera»* instead of a more idiomatic *«estudiar a la última hora»*, and inconsistent punctuation. Overall, the text sounds like a non‑native speaker’s draft rather than polished Spanish.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are handled correctly: *pre‑entrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *anclaje*. The only notable issue is the erroneous *AIC* abbreviation for ICL. The terminology is otherwise consistent and appropriate for a general audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator retains the conversational tone and cultural references, but some literal expressions (e.g., *«estudiar a la carrera»*) feel out of place. The adaptation would benefit from more idiomatic Spanish equivalents and from correcting the ICL abbreviation. Overall, the cultural adaptation is acceptable but not optimal.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original is present. Minor omissions (e.g., *«corto plazo»* vs *«corto alcance»*) do not impede understanding, and the content is not unnecessarily redundant. The translation stays faithful to the source text.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is reasonably faithful and understandable, but it suffers from several grammatical inaccuracies, awkward phrasing, and a key terminology error with the ICL abbreviation. A revision that cleans up the language, corrects the abbreviation, and replaces a few literal expressions would elevate the quality to a near‑perfect level. The translator has clearly followed the source dialogue structure and conveyed the overall meaning, but polish is needed for a professional, native‑speaker audience.\n\nOverall score (average of criteria): 16/20."
