  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is cluttered with extraneous notes, mixed-language fragments, and broken sentences, making it difficult for a reader to follow the flow. The frequent insertion of parenthetical commentary and inconsistent punctuation further disrupts comprehension. While some sentences are understandable, the overall readability suffers due to the fragmented structure.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version contains numerous grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent word choice (e.g., \"a diariamente\" instead of \"a diario\", \"una chuleta\" which is colloquial and out of place). Several expressions feel mechanical and do not flow naturally for native speakers. The text lacks the smoothness expected in a polished translation.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are inconsistently translated: \"pre-entrenamiento\" is sometimes written as \"preentrenamiento\", \"affinage\" is rendered as both \"afinage\" and \"afinar\", and \"In‑Context Learning\" is sporadically translated as \"aprendizaje en contexto\" or omitted. Some key concepts such as \"context window\" are missing or incorrectly rendered. Overall, the terminology is not consistently accurate or clear.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to adapt cultural nuances or maintain the conversational tone appropriate for a podcast. It mixes English, French, and Spanish, introduces explanatory notes that are not part of the original script, and omits cultural references that might aid understanding. The adaptation is therefore weak.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original dialogue are omitted or truncated, and some sentences are incomplete. The translation loses several explanatory moments and examples that are essential for understanding. Redundancy is also present due to inserted comments, yet crucial content is missing, so completeness is poor.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation exhibits significant flaws across all dimensions. It is fragmented, contains many grammatical and lexical errors, and fails to convey the full content of the source text. While some terminology is captured, inconsistencies and omissions compromise its usefulness. A comprehensive rewrite is necessary to achieve a coherent, accurate, and natural Spanish version suitable for a podcast audience. The overall quality is below average, and substantial revision is recommended before publication or use in a professional setting. The translation could be improved by removing extraneous notes, ensuring consistent terminology, and reconstructing the dialogue for natural flow and clarity. Overall, this version would not meet the expectations of a high‑quality, audience‑friendly Spanish translation of the original French script. Overall score: 7/20."
