    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally understandable for a native audience. Sentences are mostly clear and logically ordered. However, some parts are awkward or confusing, such as the misuse of the word *crunch* and occasional literal phrasing. These issues slightly hinder smooth comprehension, especially for listeners unfamiliar with the original French phrasing.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The overall flow is acceptable but not entirely natural. Phrases like \"En lugar de reentrenar la IA\" or \"La IA no ha \"olvidado\" en el sentido humano; su espacio de trabajo temporal ha sido vaciado\" read as slightly formal or mechanical. Additionally, repeated expressions (“aprender en contexto” appears twice consecutively) and the awkward *crunch* insertion detract from the smoothness of the dialogue. The vocabulary is mostly contemporary but could be polished for a more conversational tone.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms are largely preserved: *preentrenamiento*, *afinado*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto* (ICL), *anclaje*, *ventana de contexto*. Consistency is generally good, except for the erroneous *crunch* which should be something like *estudiar intensamente* or *bachear*. Minor style choices (e.g., *conocimientos* vs *información*) are acceptable but could be unified.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts many idiomatic expressions to Spanish, such as comparing fine‑tuning to a graduate’s specialization and ICL to hiring a consultant. However, some literal renderings (e.g., *la IA no ha \"olvidado\" en el sentido humano* or the double mention of ICL) feel forced. Cultural references are suitable, but a bit more fluid adaptation would enhance the listener’s experience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original content is present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, and the new memory feature are all discussed. The explanation of temporary vs. permanent knowledge is retained. Minor omissions are negligible, and redundancy is generally avoided. Only a few sentences (e.g., the exact phrase about *qué es un verbe*) are slightly paraphrased, but the meaning is preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the main ideas and terminology correctly, and is largely readable. However, it contains some awkward phrasing, a terminology error with *crunch*, and redundant wording. With a few refinements—especially to improve naturalness and consistency—it would reach a high level of quality for a native Spanish‑speaking audience. The core technical concepts are intact, and the dialogue maintains the original intent and conversational tone to a good extent."
