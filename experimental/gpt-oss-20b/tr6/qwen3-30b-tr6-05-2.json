  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains fragmented sentences, repeated lines, and many incomplete thoughts that make it hard to follow. The structure is disjointed, and the narrative flow of the podcast is lost. Readers will struggle to understand the progression of ideas. Score: 5/20",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text uses many literal, awkward, or nonsensical Spanish constructions (“El texto traducido al español es el siguiente”, “Hola”), and several expressions that would not sound natural to a native speaker. Punctuation and syntax are inconsistent, further breaking fluency. Score: 4/20",
      "score": 4
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are present but inconsistently used or omitted. The translation does not consistently follow Spanish conventions for AI terminology, leading to confusion. Score: 3/20",
      "score": 3
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to preserve the original intent and tone. Cultural references, idiomatic expressions, and the playful dialogue between Camille and Luc are largely missing or misrepresented. The adaptation is minimal, resulting in a text that does not resonate with a Spanish-speaking audience. Score: 2/20",
      "score": 2
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original script are omitted or replaced with unrelated fragments (“Hola”, “El texto traducido al español es “Hola, ¿cómo estás?”). Consequently, key ideas about pretraining, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, and memory features are either lost or incorrectly portrayed. Score: 4/20",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is severely flawed. It is fragmented, unnatural, and incomplete, with many missing passages and misused terminology. It fails to convey the original podcast’s content or tone, making it difficult for Spanish‑speaking listeners to understand or enjoy the material. A complete rewrite that respects the structure, terminology, and cultural context is necessary for an effective translation. The current version would be unusable for its intended purpose.  Overall, this translation does not meet the basic standards expected for a professional linguistic conversion from French to Spanish.  It is advisable to start from the original French text and produce a fresh, coherent translation rather than attempting a patch‑work fix of the existing version.  The quality falls well below acceptable thresholds for publication or professional use.  A full revision would be required to bring the work up to acceptable levels."
