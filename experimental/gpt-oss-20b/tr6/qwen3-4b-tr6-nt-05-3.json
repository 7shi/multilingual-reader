  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable; sentence structures are mostly clear and the flow is logical. Minor issues such as the mixing of French and Spanish words (e.g., “C'est donc una”) can momentarily confuse readers, but overall the text remains readable for a general audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation exhibits several awkward phrasings and grammatical errors (e.g., “C'est donc una memoria de uso único”, “La integridad del historial” instead of “el historial”). Vocabulary choices are mostly appropriate, but the presence of untranslated French terms and literal word‑for‑word renderings reduce the naturalness of the text.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved (“preentrenamiento”, “aprendizaje en contexto”), but some key terms were left in French (“ancrage”) or translated loosely (“ajuste fino” for fine‑tuning). Consistency could be improved, especially for specialized terminology that the audience is expected to recognize.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation maintains the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience, though some idiomatic choices could be refined (e.g., “¡Gracias por haber escuchado a todos!”). Overall, the contextual adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the source are present, and the translation does not omit key information. Some repetitive or redundant phrasing could be tightened, but the content is comprehensive.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the essence of the original French podcast script and delivers the core ideas. However, it suffers from a number of linguistic shortcomings—mixing languages, awkward syntax, and occasional terminology errors—that detract from a polished, native‑level reading experience. With focused editing to correct the most noticeable errors and to unify terminology, the text could reach a high standard of clarity and fluency."
