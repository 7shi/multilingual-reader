  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to understand. Sentence structures are generally logical and the progression of ideas follows the original. A few very long sentences may slow reading, but overall the dialogue feels coherent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly natural for native speakers, but several awkward expressions appear: \"la IA no está constantemente afinada por sus conversaciones\" instead of *la IA no se afina constantemente con sus conversaciones*, \"un bacheo\" which is not a common term for last‑minute studying, and \"se acuerda\" which sounds literal. Grammatical errors like missing accents or improper article use also slightly disrupt flow. Despite these issues, the text still reads smoothly overall.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled well and consistently: *preentrenamiento*, *afinado*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *memoria*. Explanations for transfer learning and grounding are clear. Minor inaccuracies (e.g., \"bacheo\") do not affect comprehension but slightly weaken precision.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references are appropriate, and the dialogue feels natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Minor stylistic adjustments (e.g., keeping the term *anclaje* rather than translating it to *grounding*) enhance clarity without losing meaning.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present; no key information is omitted. The Spanish version includes the same examples (English/French transfer learning, memory functions) and the concluding rhetorical question. Redundancy is minimal and the script remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation effectively conveys the technical concepts and conversational flow of the original French script. While readability and terminology are strong, the fluency suffers from a handful of unnatural phrasings and minor grammatical slips. Overall, it is a competent translation that would be clear to a Spanish‑speaking audience with slight polishing needed for a fully native‑sounding final product."
