    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally easy to follow and the main ideas are clearly presented. Some sentences are a little long or use literal phrasing that can be tightened (e.g., *«se percibe a menudo»* instead of *«se perciben a menudo»*), but overall the Spanish text is understandable for a native reader.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The overall flow is acceptable, but there are several spots with awkward wording or slightly non‑idiomatic phrasing: *«expansión masiva de la memoria de la IA»* sounds more literal than native; *«se pierden»* for the temporary nature of ICL is a bit abrupt; and *«crunch»* is a direct loan that doesn’t fit naturally. These reduce naturalness. The vocabulary is contemporary, but some terms could be more idiomatic.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino* (although *afinado* is used), *aprendizaje en contexto*, *ventana de contexto*, *grounding* translated as *anclaje*. The translation keeps consistency and explains concepts when necessary (e.g., describing the temporary memory). Minor inconsistencies: *«afinado»* instead of the usual *«ajuste fino»* and occasional literal renderings. Overall, terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version captures the intent of the original French text and adapts cultural references (e.g., “consultor brillante” instead of “consultant brilliant”). It avoids unnecessary English words and keeps the conversational tone. Some idiomatic expressions could be smoother, but the translation respects the target audience’s cultural background.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No major content was omitted; every section of the dialogue is present, including the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL, grounding, and the memory feature. The translator kept the same structure and detail level. There is a small redundancy in explaining the temporary nature of ICL twice, but it does not detract from clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and largely faithful to the original French text. It conveys the technical concepts clearly and keeps the dialogue’s informal, explanatory style. A few phrasing issues reduce naturalness, and terminology could be slightly refined for consistency, but overall the Spanish version is competent and understandable for a native audience."
