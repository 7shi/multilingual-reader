  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly easy to read, but several fragments (e.g. “Camille: El preentrenamiento.”) are incomplete and a few sentences have awkward word order or missing punctuation, which can momentarily confuse the reader. However, the overall structure is clear and the ideas are presented in a logical sequence.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience, but there are some unnatural phrases such as “El afinado”, “La IA los utiliza”, and the use of “invitación” instead of the more common “prompt” or “solicitud”. These lapses slightly interrupt the flow, reducing fluency.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and appropriately rendered (“preentrenamiento”, “ajuste fino”, “aprendizaje en contexto”, “ventana de contexto”). The only minor inconsistency is the use of “El afinado” which is acceptable but less common than “ajuste fino”. Overall consistency is high.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references are handled correctly and the dialogue style is preserved. A few expressions could be more idiomatic, but the adaptation is adequate for the target audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation includes all essential information from the original French script. No major content was omitted, and the explanation of concepts is intact. Minor editorial notes (e.g., “Final Translation” inserted inadvertently) do not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the core ideas of the French original and uses correct technical terminology in most cases. However, several syntactic and lexical choices slightly diminish readability and fluency. With a few revisions—especially correcting fragmentary sentences, improving word order, and replacing some literal translations—the text could reach a higher standard of naturalness and clarity for native Spanish speakers. Overall, it is a solid, competent translation that could be polished for final publication or broadcast use. The final overall score reflects a generally good translation that would benefit from targeted refinement in fluency and structural completeness. Overall, it meets the purpose but leaves room for improvement in naturalness and precision. The translation is suitable for a general audience, though specialists might notice some less common phrasing. The overall score reflects the balance between accurate content delivery and the need for minor linguistic adjustments to achieve optimal readability and fluency. The final score out of 20 is 15.5, which is an average quality translation that can be improved with further editing for a more polished outcome."
