  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version maintains clear sentence structure and logical flow. Long sentences are broken appropriately, and explanations of complex concepts such as pre‑training and in‑context learning are rendered in plain Spanish. Minor punctuation quirks (extra spaces before the quotation marks) do not impede comprehension. Overall, native readers can understand the dialogue with minimal effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural for a Spanish speaker. The phrasing \"una hoja de trucos\" for \"antisèche\" is idiomatic, and the conversational tone is preserved. Occasional lexical choices such as leaving the English term \"fine‑tuning\" unmodified are acceptable in tech contexts, though a fully Spanish version might use \"ajuste fino\". Grammar and syntax are sound, with only a few very small awkwardnesses (e.g., \"informaciones\" instead of singular \"información\").",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are correctly translated or appropriately retained: \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL). Consistency is mostly maintained, though the mix of English and Spanish for \"fine‑tuning\" could be seen as a slight inconsistency. The translation provides sufficient explanation for non‑technical readers without oversimplification.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The cultural adaptation is adequate: the dialogue feels natural for a Spanish‑speaking audience, and references to consulting are kept intact. The translation preserves the original intent and conversational nuance. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., \"consultor brillante\") enhance readability without altering meaning.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No substantive content is omitted; all exchanges, explanations, and examples from the French original appear in the Spanish text. The structure of the dialogue is intact, and redundancies are minimal. Small formatting artifacts (double asterisks) do not affect meaning. Thus, the translation is complete.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is overall accurate and well‑readable. It preserves the technical explanations, conversational tone, and narrative flow of the original French text. Minor improvements could include fully localizing all technical terms (e.g., translating \"fine‑tuning\" to \"ajuste fino\") and tightening punctuation. Nonetheless, it delivers a clear, fluent, and contextually appropriate version for Spanish‑speaking listeners."
