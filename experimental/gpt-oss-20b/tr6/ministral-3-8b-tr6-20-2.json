  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly easy to read and follows a logical sentence structure. The concepts are explained clearly, and the dialogue flows naturally. Minor issues—such as the occasional missing article or slightly awkward phrasing (“define nuestro mundo” instead of “que define nuestro mundo”)—do not significantly hinder comprehension. Overall, readability is strong but not perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely fluent for a native Spanish speaker, with most sentences sounding natural. However, there are a few awkward constructions and minor grammatical slips (e.g., “informaciones” plural, “tu nuevas solicitud”, inconsistent use of “tus” vs. “vuestras”). The bold markup in the “anclaje” line appears accidental. These issues lower the overall fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", and \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\" are correctly rendered and consistently used. The explanation added for \"anclaje\" improves understanding, and the terminology remains appropriate for the target audience. The only slight inconsistency is the use of the abbreviation \"ICL\" without parentheses, which is acceptable but could be clearer.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and style while adapting expressions to Spanish. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is straightforward. Minor mismatches in article usage and a slightly formal tone in some parts slightly reduce naturalness. Overall, the contextual adaptation is effective but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the original French script is present; no major omissions occur. The translation even adds explanatory context for terms like \"anclaje,\" which helps comprehension. Small errors in phrasing do not affect the overall content. The dialogue remains concise and clear, with redundancy appropriately avoided.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is competent and largely faithful to the original. It effectively conveys the dialogue, technical concepts, and nuances of the French script. Minor grammatical errors, occasional awkward phrasing, and formatting glitches slightly reduce readability and fluency, but the translation remains clear and informative. With some polishing—especially around article usage, plural forms, and consistent pronoun usage—the text would be near perfect for a Spanish-speaking audience."
