  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to follow. The sentence structure mirrors the original, making the dialogue coherent. However, a few phrases (e.g., *Lo han entendido todo*) feel slightly forced, and some long sentences could be split for better flow. Overall, the content is comprehensible to a native audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally in most parts. Minor awkwardness appears in word choice (*analizamos* for *décryptamos*) and in the use of *Lo han entendido todo*, which could be smoother. There is no major grammatical error, but a few expressions could be more idiomatic.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are accurately translated and consistently used: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *anclaje*. The abbreviation ICL is kept in English with a literal translation in brackets, which is acceptable though a Spanish equivalent could be added for clarity. Overall, terminology is appropriate and clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation respects the original intent and tone. Cultural references are minimal and thus largely unnecessary to adjust. The translator has kept the dialogue natural for a Spanish-speaking audience. A few small improvements could enhance localization (e.g., *¡Hola y bienvenidos!* vs. *¡Hola y bienvenidos!*) but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the source text is present; no sections were omitted. The translator added no extraneous content and maintained conciseness. The dialogue structure and key explanations are fully retained.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the original meaning and tone while being understandable and largely natural for a Spanish-speaking audience. Minor refinements in phrasing and consistency would elevate it to near-perfect."
