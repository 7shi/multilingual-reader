    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version retains the original dialogue’s structure and the narrative flow. Sentences are generally clear and follow a logical order, making the content understandable for a native Spanish speaker. However, a few long, compound sentences could be broken up for greater ease of reading, and minor adjustments to punctuation would improve flow. Overall, the text is readable, though some phrasing feels slightly awkward.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly in most parts, and the vocabulary is contemporary. Nevertheless, there are a few unnatural expressions, such as \"Tú has comprendido todo\" (should be \"Has comprendido todo\") and the use of \"enraizamiento\" for \"grounding\". These choices make the text feel slightly mechanical in places. Nonetheless, the overall tone remains conversational and appropriate for a podcast transcript.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely correctly rendered: \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", and \"In-Context Learning\" are well‑adapted. The main issue is the translation of \"grounding\" as \"enraizamiento\"; the more idiomatic Spanish term would be \"anclaje\". Apart from that, terminology stays consistent and is adequately explained for the target audience.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator effectively localizes expressions for a Spanish‑speaking audience, using idiomatic language and keeping cultural references aligned. The adaptation captures the original intent of each segment, and there is no loss of meaning. Minor cultural adjustments (e.g., avoiding overly literal French idioms) could improve the feel, but the current version is culturally appropriate.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French source is present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the distinction between temporary and permanent memory, and the new memory feature. No key points are omitted, and redundancy is minimal. The translation stays concise while preserving clarity.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "This Spanish translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the original French dialogue and maintaining the podcast’s conversational tone. Minor improvements could be made in fluency—particularly with idiomatic phrasing and the correct translation of \"grounding\"—but overall the text is clear, accurate, and well‑adapted to Spanish listeners. The translation serves its purpose effectively and would be well received by a native audience."
