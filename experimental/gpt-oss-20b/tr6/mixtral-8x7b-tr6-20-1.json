  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is fragmented, contains many incomplete sentences, misplaced punctuation, and duplicated lines that hinder comprehension. Readers would struggle to follow the dialogue and grasp the concepts presented.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "There are numerous unnatural expressions, grammatical errors (e.g., incorrect gender agreement, missing articles), and awkward phrasing that disrupt the flow. The translation does not read smoothly for a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are sometimes translated correctly but inconsistently. Misnomers like \"étape initiale de apprentissage\" for \"pre‑entraînement\" and the inconsistent use of acronyms (ICL) reflect a lack of terminological precision.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent—to explain fine‑tuning versus in‑context learning—gets diluted by mistranslations, missing context, and cultural references that are not adapted for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The dialogue loses its conversational tone and clarity.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Important parts of the original script are omitted or incorrectly rendered (e.g., the distinction between permanent and temporary memory, the explanation of transfer learning). The translation also introduces extraneous content not present in the source, leading to redundancy and loss of key information.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is substantially flawed. It contains numerous errors in grammar, terminology, and completeness, which severely compromise readability and the faithful conveyance of the original meaning. A thorough revision is necessary to produce a coherent, accurate, and natural Spanish version of the script. The current version is not suitable for publication or use in a professional context without significant editing and re‑translation of the missing sections.  \n\nAverage score: 5/20 (out of 20 points per criterion)."
