  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to read and follows a logical sentence structure. Some long sentences and a few awkward phrasing (e.g., “la IA no ha ‘perdido’ el contexto en el sentido humano; su memoria temporal simplemente se ha vaciado”) slightly reduce clarity, but overall the content is comprehensible to a native Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly in most places, but there are instances of unnatural phrasing and redundancy (e.g., repeated “Aprendizaje en Contexto”). The dialogue feels a bit mechanical and could benefit from more idiomatic Spanish. Nonetheless, it remains largely natural for listeners.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as “preentrenamiento,” “afinamiento,” “aprendizaje por transferencia,” “ventana de contexto,” and “ICL” are correctly rendered and consistently used. The Spanish equivalents convey the intended meaning without confusion, and the translation retains the nuance of the original French.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The adaptation to Spanish culture is good: the conversational tone, use of colloquial expressions (e.g., “consultor brillante”), and the overall framing fit a podcast audience. Minor cultural tweaks (like the phrase “le damos una chuleta”) might feel slightly informal but still appropriate for a relaxed format.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No significant content was omitted; the script retains all key points and explanations. A few minor additions for clarity (e.g., elaboration on the memory mechanism) are present, and repetition is limited. The translation stays concise and clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version captures the spirit and technical detail of the original French text. It is largely readable and natural, with consistent terminology and faithful content. Minor stylistic tweaks could improve flow, but overall the translation is of high quality."
