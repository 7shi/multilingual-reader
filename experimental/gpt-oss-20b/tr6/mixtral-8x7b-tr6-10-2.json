  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is fragmented, missing context and contains a lot of interjected notes and commentary that break the flow of the conversation. Readers would struggle to follow the dialogue and grasp the main points. It is therefore not very readable or comprehensible.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish produced is riddled with unnatural constructions (e.g., \"preentrenamiento\" instead of \"pre‑entrenamiento\", incorrect verb forms, inconsistent capitalization), missing accents, and occasional English phrases. The overall rhythm and smoothness expected of native Spanish are lacking.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"pre‑entraînement\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"apprentissage en contexte\" are inconsistently translated or omitted. Some terms are replaced with less precise equivalents (e.g., \"ajuste\" for \"affinage\") and there is no effort to explain or adapt them for the target audience. Terminology is therefore inadequately handled.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to preserve the original intent and style of a podcast dialogue. Cultural references and idiomatic expressions are either mistranslated or removed. The inserted commentary and editorial notes disturb the cultural adaptation, making the text less suitable for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original conversation are missing, and many explanations are omitted or garbled. The translation does not convey the full meaning of the original text, leading to significant omissions and a loss of detail.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of very low quality. It is fragmented, contains many errors, and fails to convey the original meaning or maintain a coherent dialogue. Significant revision is needed to produce a readable, fluent, and accurate Spanish version that respects technical terminology and cultural context. The average score is 5 out of 20, indicating major shortcomings in all evaluated aspects of translation quality. It is recommended to redo the translation from scratch, ensuring consistent terminology, proper flow, and faithful adaptation to the target audience.\n\nScore: 5/20"
