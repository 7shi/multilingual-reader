  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and follows a logical sentence structure. However, there are a few awkward phrases and punctuation issues that can slightly hinder fluency for native listeners (e.g., misuse of colons, missing commas). Nonetheless, the overall content is comprehensible.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While the translation captures most of the dialogue, several sentences feel unnatural or are translated word‑by‑word from French. Examples include \"Camille dice que, después del preentrenamiento…\" and the borrowed term \"antisèche\". These quirks reduce the natural flow of the text for a native Spanish audience.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\" and \"grounding\" are translated appropriately. However, some terms like \"fine‑tuning\" are inconsistently rendered as \"afinamiento\" and occasionally left untranslated. Overall terminology handling is good but could be more consistent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references and idiomatic expressions reasonably well, but occasionally retains French or English terms (e.g., \"ICL\", \"antisèche\"). The intended meaning is preserved, and the style is conversational, which suits a podcast audience. Minor improvements could further localize the script.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the essential narrative and dialogue structure. A few subtle details (like the exact phrasing of a question) are slightly altered or missing, and some English words slip into the Spanish text. Despite these small gaps, the overall information is largely complete and coherent.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is solid and conveys the key concepts of the original French script, but it contains several grammatical slips, occasional literal translations, and inconsistent terminology. These issues slightly affect readability and fluency but do not compromise the overall understanding of the podcast content. With a few refinements—particularly in punctuation, natural phrasing, and consistent term usage—the translation would achieve a higher level of polish suitable for a native Spanish-speaking audience of a tech podcast. Overall, the translation demonstrates a good grasp of the subject matter but would benefit from a more meticulous post‑editing phase to enhance its naturalness and precision. The final overall rating reflects these strengths and weaknesses."
