    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly clear and logically structured. Simple sentences are easy to follow, and complex ideas such as transfer learning and in‑context learning are explained with adequate examples. Minor issues arise from slightly awkward phrasing (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto, es un memorizar de última hora.”) and a few literal, less natural clauses. Overall, a native reader can comprehend the content with minimal effort.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally flows smoothly, but several expressions feel stilted or literal. Phrases like “Se podría decir que” and the insertion of a comma in “El aprendizaje en contexto, es …” interrupt natural rhythm. The use of parenthetical abbreviations (AEC, ICL) is confusing and breaks the flow. Vocabulary is appropriate, but the syntax could be tightened for a more native sound.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved correctly (preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning, anclaje, memoria). However, the translation introduces an unneeded abbreviation (AEC) and mixes it with ICL, creating inconsistency. The term “fine‑tuning” is left untranslated, which is acceptable, but the switch to AEC is not justified. Overall consistency suffers slightly.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and tone. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is straightforward. The script retains the conversational style and humor. Nonetheless, the occasional literal rendering (e.g., “memorizar de última hora”) slightly undermines cultural fluency. The overall context is preserved, but some optimization could improve reader engagement.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, and memory features. Minor omissions include the explicit mention of the abbreviation “ICL” (used in the original) and the subtle nuance of “memory” being a form of automated context learning. No significant information is omitted, and redundancies are largely avoided.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation conveys the main ideas and overall structure of the original French script. Readability and contextual fidelity are strong, but fluency and terminology consistency suffer from occasional literal phrasing and unexplained abbreviations. The translation is functional and understandable, but it would benefit from smoothing sentence construction and unifying technical terminology for a more polished final product."
