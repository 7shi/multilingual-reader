  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely coherent and follows a logical, conversational flow. Sentences are mostly straightforward and the speaker turns are clearly marked. However, a few phrasing choices feel slightly awkward for native readers (e.g., *se van a desvelar la manera en que* instead of *descubriremos*, *empollamiento*), which mildly hampers readability. Overall, listeners can understand the content without major effort.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly for most of the piece and uses contemporary vocabulary. Some minor grammatical/word‑choice oddities—such as *se van a desvelar la manera en que*, *empollamiento*, and the occasional over‑literal use of English terms—interrupt the natural flow a little. Nevertheless, the overall tone remains native‑like.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto*, *In‑Context Learning* are all correctly translated. The use of *prompt* in English is acceptable for a technical audience but could be replaced with *texto de entrada* for full consistency. No major terminology errors are present.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserved the informal, dialogue‑style tone suitable for a podcast, adapting cultural references (e.g., *consultor brillante*) to Spanish equivalents. The overall intent of the original is conveyed. Minor cultural adaptation could improve word choices like *se van a desvelar* or *empollamiento*.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Every line and nuance from the French original appears in the Spanish version. No content was omitted, and the translation does not add extraneous information. Redundancies were avoided, keeping the text concise while faithful to the source.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is highly accurate and preserves the conversational tone of the original French podcast. Minor linguistic refinements would elevate its naturalness, but it effectively conveys all technical concepts and contextual nuances, making it suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience familiar with AI terminology. Overall, it scores 90/100, reflecting strong fidelity and readability with small room for stylistic polish. "
