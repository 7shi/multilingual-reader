  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally easy to understand for a Spanish‑speaking audience. Sentence structures are mostly clear and the progression of ideas follows the original. However, some phrasing is slightly awkward (e.g., “C'est donc una memoria de un solo uso”) and a few long sentences could benefit from splitting for better flow. Overall, readability is solid but not perfect.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several literal remnants of French (“C'est donc…”, “Mejor”), awkward punctuation, and inconsistent verb forms. The overall flow is understandable, but these errors break naturalness. Vocabulary choices are generally appropriate, yet some phrases feel clunky. Fluency could be improved by polishing these elements.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\", etc. The term \"ICL\" is left in English, which is acceptable, though an explicit translation would enhance consistency. Minor inconsistencies exist (e.g., \"afinamiento\" vs. \"fine‑tuning\"), but overall terminology is appropriate and consistent.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the intent and humor of the original, but some expressions are not fully adapted to Spanish (e.g., mixing French and Spanish words, “Merci por escucharnos”). Cultural references are generally preserved, but a few phrases could be more idiomatic. The adaptation is adequate but not fully optimized.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are present in the Spanish version. No significant content is omitted, and the narrative flow remains intact. Minor clarifications could improve precision, but overall the information is complete and concise.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and largely faithful to the original, conveying the key concepts and maintaining the conversational tone. However, it suffers from occasional literal carry‑overs from French, awkward phrasing, and minor inconsistencies in terminology. Refining these areas would elevate the text to a more polished, native‑level Spanish rendition."
