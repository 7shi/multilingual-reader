  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely coherent and follows the original narrative structure. Sentences are clear and logically ordered, making the complex concepts of pre‑training, fine‑tuning and in‑context learning understandable for a general audience. Minor issues arise in a few places where punctuation or article usage could be tightened, but overall the flow is smooth. Score: 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation uses natural Spanish, with appropriate vocabulary and syntax. Some expressions feel slightly informal or abrupt, e.g., \"¡Lo han pillado todo!\" and \"es un truco?\" which may sound more casual than the original. There are also a few small grammatical slips (e.g., missing accent marks in \"IA es\" or a slightly clunky phrasing in \"es el aprendizaje en contexto activo\"). Nevertheless, the text reads well to a native speaker. Score: 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"ICL (Aprendizaje en Contexto)\", \"anclaje\", \"memoria\". The translation provides clear equivalents for all key concepts and maintains a uniform terminology throughout. Minor room for improvement: the use of \"anclaje\" for \"grounding\" is acceptable but could be clarified further. Score: 18/20.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal, conversational tone of the podcast and adapts cultural references appropriately (e.g., \"montar en bicicleta\" instead of the literal French expression). It also retains the humor and rhetorical devices of the original. Some adaptations are slightly informal, but they suit the target audience of a Spanish‑speaking podcast listener. Score: 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French original is present: the explanation of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, anchoring, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge. No major omissions or additions distort the message, and the text remains concise while still comprehensive. Score: 19/20.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, faithfully conveying the technical content and conversational style of the original French script. Minor stylistic and grammatical refinements would elevate the text further, but it is already clear, natural, and complete for Spanish‑speaking listeners. Overall, a solid and professional job with room for small polish improvements. The translation achieves the intended purpose and communicates the key concepts effectively to its audience. The final overall score is 17 out of 20."
