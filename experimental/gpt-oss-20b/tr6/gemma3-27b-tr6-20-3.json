    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to follow, with clear sentence structures and logical flow. Minor issues arise in some longer sentences (e.g., “El ajuste fino, en cambio, tiene como objetivo crear una competencia permanente…”) that could be broken up for smoother reading, but overall the text remains comprehensible to a general audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural, but there are a few awkward expressions such as \"la IA no ha olvidado en el sentido humano de la palabra\" and \"se ha vaciado su espacio de trabajo temporal\". Some word choices (e.g., \"fundamentación\" for grounding) feel slightly stilted. Overall fluency is acceptable but not flawless.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are largely preserved: pre-entrenamiento, ajuste fino, transferencia de aprendizaje, aprendizaje en contexto, ICL. However, the translator keeps the English term \"transfer learning\" in a few places instead of consistently translating it as \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", and \"grounding\" is rendered as \"fundamentación\" rather than the more common \"anclaje\". This inconsistency slightly weakens terminology handling.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue style is maintained, and cultural references are appropriately adapted for Spanish‑speaking audiences (e.g., greeting in Spanish, keeping the podcast title). Contextual adaptation is strong, with no major cultural mismatches. The translation could slightly improve idiomatic usage, but overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All core points from the original French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory features, and the consultant vs. expert analogy. No critical information is omitted, and the content remains concise. Minor redundancies were not introduced.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation communicates the main ideas of the French original with good readability and a fairly natural tone. Some technical terms are inconsistently translated, and a few phrases feel slightly unnatural, but these do not impede comprehension. With minor refinements to terminology consistency and smoother phrasing, the translation would achieve an even higher quality level. Overall, it is a solid, competent rendition suitable for a general Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI concepts in a podcast format."
