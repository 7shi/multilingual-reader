    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, with clear sentence structure and logical flow. However, some passages (e.g., \"Imagínense que enviamos una IA completamente nueva a la escuela para darle una cultura general\") feel slightly literal and could be refined for smoother comprehension. Minor redundancies and a few awkward phrasing affect overall clarity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally overall, but there are inconsistencies in formality (mix of \"tú\" and \"usted\") and a few slightly clumsy constructions such as \"Usted ha entendido todo\" and \"El modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus conversaciones.\" These do not majorly impede fluency but reduce polish.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL), \"anclaje\", \"memoria\". Explanations accompany many terms, and usage is consistent throughout. Minor style issues exist (e.g., using \"afinamiento\" instead of \"ajuste fino\"), but overall terminology is appropriate for a general Spanish-speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The core intent of the original is preserved, but cultural adaptation could be improved. Phrases such as \"cultura general\" or literal translations like \"preentrenamiento\" instead of the more common \"preentrenado\" feel slightly forced. The dialogue remains informal and conversational, matching the podcast style, but could benefit from tighter alignment with Spanish idiomatic expressions.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All segments of the original script appear in the translation, with no omitted ideas. Explanations are provided where needed, and redundancies are largely avoided. The text remains concise yet comprehensive, faithfully conveying the information from the source.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and generally accurate, effectively conveying the main concepts and dialogue. Minor adjustments in style, formality consistency, and more natural phrasing would elevate the quality to a higher standard. The technical terminology and contextual intent are well preserved, making it suitable for a general Spanish-speaking audience familiar with AI concepts. Overall, it demonstrates good linguistic competence with room for refinement in fluency and cultural adaptation aspects. The total score reflects a strong but not perfect translation effort, highlighting areas for improvement in polish and contextual nuance. The translation serves its purpose well but could be polished further to match native speaker expectations fully. The overall score is 85 out of 100, indicating high quality with some room for enhancement in naturalness and cultural adaptation."
