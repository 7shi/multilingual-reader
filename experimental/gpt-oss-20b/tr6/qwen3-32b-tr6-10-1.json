  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves the logical flow and clear explanation of concepts. Sentence structures are generally correct and easy to follow, though a few long sentences could be split for better readability.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly naturally, but there are a few awkward phrasings such as \"hoja de trucos\" and the use of \"se le ha proporcionado\" in that context. Minor grammatical slips also appear, yet overall it feels quite smooth for a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" (anclaje). The terminology is consistent throughout, with only occasional use of the English phrase \"fine-tuning\" left untranslated. The overall terminology is appropriate for a general Spanish-speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator kept the informal, conversational tone of the original and adapted cultural references adequately. The Spanish version captures the spirit of the podcast and addresses listeners naturally, without unnecessary cultural adaptation, which is appropriate for the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the French transcript are present, including the descriptions of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, ICL, and the memory feature. No essential information is omitted, and redundancies are avoided, maintaining a concise yet thorough narrative.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is strong and largely faithful to the source material. The primary issues are minor naturalness hiccups and a slightly literal rendering of a few phrases. These do not impede comprehension but could be smoothed for a more polished final version. The translation demonstrates good technical accuracy, cultural adaptation, and completeness, making it suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience interested in AI topics. Overall score: 18/20."
