  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and follows a logical sentence structure. However, some words are uncommon or slightly awkward for native readers (e.g., *empollar* for “barrer” or “memorizar” and *chuleta* for “cheat sheet”). These choices may confuse or distract readers, lowering overall clarity.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The overall flow is smooth, but a few phrases feel literal or colloquial: *empollar* and *chuleta* are not standard in formal or conversational Spanish. Replacing them with *aprender* or *memorizar* and *cheat sheet* or *chuleta* (if informality is intended) would improve naturalness. Minor syntactic adjustments would also help.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely correct (*preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *grounding* → *anclaje*). Consistency is maintained, and explanations are provided when needed. A couple of terms could be tweaked for clarity, but overall terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the original intent and context. Cultural references (e.g., consulting, bicycle analogy) work well in Spanish. The adaptation is adequate, though some expressions could be slightly refined to match Spanish-speaking audiences’ idiomatic usage.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "No major information is omitted; the conversation flow, key concepts, and examples are preserved. The translation is concise and does not add unnecessary content. A few nuanced details (e.g., the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge) are clearly conveyed.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation captures the essence of the original French dialogue and presents it in a largely coherent form. Some vocabulary choices are less conventional for native Spanish speakers, which slightly hampers readability and fluency. The technical terminology is mostly accurate, and contextual adaptation is good. With minor adjustments—especially replacing *empollar* with a more common verb and smoothing a few colloquialisms—the translation would achieve a higher level of naturalness and clarity without sacrificing accuracy or completeness. Overall, it is a competent translation that would serve its intended audience well after a few edits for idiomatic polish."
