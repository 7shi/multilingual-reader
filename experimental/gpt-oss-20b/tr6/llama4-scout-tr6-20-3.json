    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version preserves most of the original structure, making it generally easy to follow. However, some sentences are long and contain awkward phraseology (e.g., \"cuando comienza una nueva conversación\") that slightly hampers smooth reading. Minor punctuation inconsistencies and occasional missing accents also affect clarity. Overall, readers can understand the content but would benefit from more concise sentence construction.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly naturally for native Spanish speakers, but there are several instances of unnatural diction such as \"coger\" instead of the more common \"tomar\" in this context, and occasional mis‑placement of exclamation marks. The usage of quotes around “Memoria” is stylistically odd. The flow is mostly smooth, yet these small issues lower the fluency.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly – \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" – and are consistent throughout. Some English terms like \"fine‑tuning\" slip through, breaking consistency, but the overall terminology is appropriate for a lay audience. The translator also retains the French title \"Tech Éclair\" unchanged, which is acceptable. Overall terminology usage is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and conversational tone, adapting expressions for Spanish‑speaking listeners (e.g., “consultor excepcional” instead of a literal literal translation). Cultural references are minimal, so no major issues arise. Nevertheless, the use of angled quotation marks for the word “Memoria” feels slightly out of place in Spanish typography, which slightly detracts from cultural adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key ideas from the original French script are preserved – pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, grounding, memory features – and no major facts are omitted. Some explanatory clarifications (e.g., the nature of temporary vs permanent knowledge) are repeated faithfully. Minor omissions, such as the exact mention of “window of context,” are implied but not explicitly stated, which is acceptable for this format.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and largely faithful to the original French text, conveying the technical concepts and conversational tone effectively. Minor linguistic imperfections (unnecessary English terms, occasional mis‑punctuation, slightly awkward word choices) prevent it from being flawless. With a few edits for consistency and naturalness, the Spanish version would meet high-quality standards for a general audience. Overall, it is a solid translation that could be used for a podcast episode with minimal post‑editing, achieving a solid 15.6/20 score overall. This reflects strong readability and terminology use, with room for improvement in fluency and contextual polish. The translator has maintained the core ideas, making the content accessible and engaging for Spanish listeners while preserving the original message’s intent and nuance. The translation works well for a lay audience, with only small adjustments needed to fully align with native stylistic conventions and maximize clarity."
