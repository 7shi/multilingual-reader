  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand for native readers, with clear explanations of complex concepts such as pre‑training and fine‑tuning. Sentence structure is mostly logical, though there are a few minor issues – e.g. the abrupt repetition of \"Es\" in “Es el aprendizaje en contexto, es el bachotaje” and the lingering French punctuation (“Exactement !”). These do not severely impede comprehension but slightly reduce smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most sentences flow naturally, the translation occasionally contains foreign insertions that feel out of place for a Spanish audience: the French word \"Exactement !\" remains untranslated, and the term \"antisèche\" (original French) is kept instead of a Spanish equivalent. Such oddities, along with the slightly literal phrasing in some sections, reduce overall fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are generally preserved correctly – e.g. \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" – but some important terms are not fully adapted: \"grounding\" is left in French as \"ancrage\", and \"fine‑tuning\" remains untranslated. Consistency is otherwise acceptable, but the mix of languages weakens the precision of terminology.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and retains the conversational tone suitable for a podcast audience. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is adequate. However, the presence of untranslated French words slightly undermines the localized feel.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are present in the Spanish version, including the explanations of pre‑training, fine‑tuning, in‑context learning, and memory features. Minor redundancies exist but do not obscure meaning, and there are no significant omissions.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is functional and largely understandable, but it falls short in fluency and terminology consistency due to the retention of French terms in a Spanish text. The overall message and structure are preserved, yet the presence of foreign words detracts from a fully natural and professional Spanish rendition. With a few language‑specific adjustments, the translation could reach a higher quality level.\n\nOverall score: 15.6/20 (rounded to 16/20 for reporting)."
