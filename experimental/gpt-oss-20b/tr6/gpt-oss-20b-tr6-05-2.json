  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is partially readable: the first part is fully in Spanish and understandable, but almost all subsequent text remains in French, which breaks continuity for Spanish readers. The presence of French blocks makes it difficult for a Spanish‑speaking audience to follow the entire episode, resulting in moderate readability.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish sections are fluent, natural, and largely free of grammatical errors. However, the extensive use of French passages severely undermines overall fluency in Spanish, as they are not smooth for the target audience.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"In‑Context Learning\", etc., are appropriately translated and consistent where present. Yet the French fragments introduce inconsistency, as the same terms appear in French instead of Spanish. Thus, terminology handling is competent but incomplete.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Initial greetings and cultural references are well adapted (e.g., \"Hola y bienvenidos\" instead of \"Bonjour et bienvenue\"). Later, the failure to translate further content into Spanish reduces contextual adaptation. Overall, adaptation is mixed.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Only the first part of the dialogue is translated into Spanish; the remainder remains in French, meaning significant content is missing for Spanish readers. The translation therefore lacks completeness.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates good linguistic handling in the portions that are correctly translated into Spanish, with natural phrasing and accurate terminology. However, the failure to fully translate the latter part of the script into Spanish, leaving large segments in French, severely limits readability, fluency, and completeness for a Spanish‑speaking audience. The translation should be revised to provide a fully Spanish version of the entire episode, ensuring consistency, full coverage, and proper contextual adaptation throughout. This would significantly improve the overall quality and usefulness of the translation for its intended audience."
