    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and follows the same conversational flow as the French original. Sentence structures are generally clear, but a few phrases feel slightly awkward (e.g., *“se envía una nueva IA a una escuela”* and *“para darle un conocimiento básico”*), which may momentarily distract readers. Overall, the text remains easy to read for native Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads smoothly in most places, but there are minor stylistic and grammatical quirks: *“enraizado”* is not idiomatic, and the use of *“refina”* for *affiner* feels off. Punctuation is consistent, yet some compound sentences could be broken up for greater naturalness. Still, the majority of expressions sound natural to a native audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered (e.g., *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *memoria*). However, *grounding* is translated as *enraizado*, which is not standard; a better choice would be *anclaje* or *enraizamiento*. This mismatch slightly undermines precision. Terminology consistency is otherwise good.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The cultural context is respected; the dialogue keeps the informal, conversational tone suitable for a podcast script. Nonetheless, certain expressions could be localized further (e.g., *“se envía una nueva IA a una escuela”* could be *“se lanza una nueva IA a una ‘escuela’ de datos”*). The core intent is preserved, so adaptation is adequate but not exemplary.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue segments from the original are present; no major ideas were omitted. Minor nuances (like the exact wording of *grounding*) are slightly altered due to terminology choice but not omitted. The translation remains concise and clear, avoiding unnecessary repetition.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is generally faithful and comprehensible, capturing the key concepts and maintaining the conversational style of the original podcast script. Small issues with terminology and occasional awkward phrasing slightly reduce its polish, but the overall quality is strong and suitable for a native Spanish-speaking audience. Addressing the terminology mismatch for *grounding* and smoothing out a few syntactic quirks would elevate the translation to near‑perfect status. Overall, it is a solid, professional job with room for minor refinements in technical phrasing and naturalness."
