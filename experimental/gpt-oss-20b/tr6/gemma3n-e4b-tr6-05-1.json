  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text remains partially understandable, but several sentences are garbled, incomplete, or poorly structured, which hinders smooth comprehension. Overall readability is roughly in the middle of the scale.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version contains many awkward or incorrect word choices, literal mistranslations, duplicated phrases, and leftover French fragments, making it feel unnatural to a native reader.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are sometimes translated correctly (e.g., \"pre-entrenamiento\"), but others are misused or omitted (e.g., \"reaprender\", \"anclado\"), and consistent terminology is lacking. The overall technical accuracy is low.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Cultural references are largely preserved, but several idiomatic expressions and cultural nuances are mistranslated or missing. The adaptation is mediocre, though not completely inappropriate.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several passages from the original are either omitted or incorrectly rendered, and some sentences are truncated. The translation does not fully convey the complete meaning of the source.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation attempts to follow the original but suffers from numerous inaccuracies, awkward phrasing, missing sections, and residual French text. The result is a text that is difficult to understand, lacks fluency, and does not faithfully reproduce the source material. Overall, the quality is below acceptable standards for a professional translation of this type and length. Significant revisions are required to bring it to an acceptable level of clarity, correctness, and completeness, particularly in terminology, contextual adaptation, and overall coherence of the content. The translator should address the errors, ensure consistency in terminology, refine the natural flow of sentences, and carefully check that all parts of the source text are present and accurately translated. This would result in a more polished, reliable, and reader‑friendly final product that effectively conveys the intended message to a Spanish‑speaking audience, preserving both the technical details and the stylistic tone of the original French text. The translation currently falls short in key areas, and a thorough re‑editing process would be essential before it could be considered fit for publication or professional use.\n\n\nOverall evaluation: The translation is a rough, inconsistent draft that requires substantial editing to meet standard quality thresholds for readability, fluency, terminology accuracy, contextual adaptation, and information completeness. A final version that fully addresses these deficiencies would be expected to score considerably higher across all dimensions, ideally in the 15–20 range on each criterion. Until such revisions are made, the translation remains below the threshold for a reliable, professional output. This assessment is intended to guide the translator toward the specific areas needing improvement.\n\n\nOverall score: 9/20 (average of the individual criteria scores). The translation is thus below the desired quality threshold and requires significant revision before it can be considered suitable for its intended audience and purpose."
