  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is fragmented and contains many unrelated sentences, making it almost impossible for a Spanish‑speaking reader to follow the intended meaning of the podcast script. The sentence structure is broken, key concepts are missing, and logical flow is lost. Therefore readability is very poor.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text is not fluent; it contains abrupt switches, literal placeholders, and non‑existent phrases (“El perro corre rápido por el parque” in the wrong context). The overall rhythm and naturalness expected in native Spanish are absent.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as “preentrenamiento”, “fine-tuning”, “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “ventana de contexto”, and “In‑Context Learning” are either omitted, mistranslated, or replaced with unrelated words. There is no consistent terminology, leading to confusion.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to preserve the original intent, tone, and conversational style. Cultural references and colloquial expressions are missing or misrepresented, resulting in a loss of context.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original content are absent; many dialogues are missing entirely. The translation provides only isolated fragments, omitting critical information about the concepts discussed in the podcast.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is severely incomplete and inaccurate. It neither preserves the content nor the style of the original French script, making it unusable for Spanish-speaking audiences. Significant revision or a fresh translation is required to meet any standard of quality.  Overall, this translation demonstrates serious deficiencies across all evaluated aspects, and it would not be acceptable for publication or professional use.  The score reflects these shortcomings, offering only a minimal amount of usable text and context.  A comprehensive rewrite is strongly recommended.  Score: 2/20 (out of 20)."
