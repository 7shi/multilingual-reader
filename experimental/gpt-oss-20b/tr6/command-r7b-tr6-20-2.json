    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely comprehensible and follows the original dialogue structure. Sentences are generally coherent, but some phrases feel literal or awkward (e.g., \"Aprendizaje In-Contexto\", \"vosotros\" in a possibly Latin‑American context). The flow is clear, though a few passages are missing contextual explanation from the source.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The overall tone is mostly natural, but there are noticeable unnatural expressions: \"Aprendizaje In-Contexto\" instead of the more common \"aprendizaje en contexto\", and a mis‑translation of the fine‑tuning concept. Some minor grammatical slips (e.g., \"aprenderá leet\" seems like a typo). These affect smoothness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms are usually translated correctly (pre‑entrenamiento, ancrage → ancoraje, ICL). However, the explanation of fine‑tuning is wrong, and the term \"In-Contexto\" is not standard. Consistency issues arise when the text switches between literal and paraphrased meanings.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the informal conversational style and cultural references, and it adapts expressions appropriately for Spanish listeners. Minor cultural mismatches (use of vosotros) exist, but overall the intent and purpose of the original are conveyed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most information from the original is present, but the section on fine‑tuning is omitted or incorrectly rendered. Some extra explanatory sentences are added that are not in the source, while certain nuances (e.g., the precise definition of ICL as memorization) are lost or blurred. Overall, the content is fairly complete but not fully accurate.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is generally understandable and retains much of the original dialogue and meaning. However, there are several inaccuracies, particularly around the fine‑tuning explanation, and some naturalness issues with terminology and phrasing. With targeted revisions to clarify terminology and correct the misinterpretation of fine‑tuning, the translation would achieve a higher quality level. Overall, it is competent but needs refinement to reach a professional standard."
