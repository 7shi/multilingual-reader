  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable and follows the logical flow of the original. Sentences are short and the speaker roles are clearly indicated. However, some sentences feel slightly mechanical because of literal translations (e.g., *“se le ha proporcionado simplemente una pista”*). Overall, listeners can grasp the concepts, but a few phrasing tweaks would improve clarity.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text mostly reads smoothly, but several expressions are awkward or too literal. For instance, *“se le ha proporcionado simplemente una pista justo antes de que comenzara a hablarle”* is clunky and would sound odd to native Spanish listeners. The use of *“pista”* instead of *“información”* or *“antecedentes”* diminishes naturalness. The rest of the dialogue flows well, but these small issues lower the overall fluency.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as *pre‑entrenamiento*, *fine‑tuning*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, *ventana de contexto* and *In‑Context Learning* are rendered correctly. The term *anclaje* for grounding is acceptable, though *fundamentación* or *anclaje semántico* might be more common. Terminology is consistent throughout the transcript, and the translation does not omit or misinterpret any key concepts.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, maintaining the conversational style between Camille and Luc. Cultural references are minimal, and where present, the Spanish version adapts them appropriately. However, some phrasing could be more idiomatic for a Spanish audience (e.g., *“se le ha proporcionado simplemente una pista”*). Overall, the context is well retained.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All sections of the original French transcript are present in the Spanish version, including speaker names, content, and narrative flow. No major information is omitted. Minor redundancies exist, but they do not obscure meaning. The translation remains concise while conveying the same details.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the essential meaning of the original and preserves the conversational structure. It is largely readable and includes all technical terminology correctly. Nonetheless, a few phrases feel literal and could benefit from more natural wording. With some refinement, the Spanish version would read like an original script rather than a direct translation, improving fluency and overall reader enjoyment. The current quality is solid, but fine-tuning language usage would elevate it to near‑perfect level for native Spanish audiences. The translation demonstrates good comprehension of the source text and a clear intent to adapt for Spanish listeners, though slight idiomatic adjustments would enhance its polish and engagement potential. Overall, the translation is functional and communicative, making it useful for audiences familiar with the discussed AI concepts. The score reflects strong performance with room for natural language refinement."
