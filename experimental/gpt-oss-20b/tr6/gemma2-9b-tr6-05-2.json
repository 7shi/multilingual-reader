  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is largely understandable to a Spanish-speaking audience. Sentence structures are mostly correct and the flow follows the original dialogue. However, occasional literal translations and the use of mixed French words (“C’est donc”) interrupt the reader’s comprehension, lowering the score.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several parts read awkwardly or contain direct French fragments (e.g., “C’est donc una memoria…”, “Merci por escucharnos”). The overall style is conversational, but these mixed-language snippets and some literal phrasing (e.g., “se envía una IA completamente nueva a la escuela”) detract from naturalness. The vocabulary is appropriate but not consistently smooth.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: “pre‑entrenamiento”, “afinamiento”, “transfer learning” → “aprendizaje por transferencia”, “In‑Context Learning” → “aprendizaje en contexto”, “grounding” → “anclaje”. Minor inconsistencies arise only where French words appear in the Spanish text. Overall, terminology is accurate and consistent.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator adapted the show title to “Tech Rayo”, a plausible Spanish equivalent for “Tech Éclair”, but it slightly deviates from the original. Cultural references are preserved and the dialog feels appropriate for a Spanish-speaking audience. The adaptation is mostly successful, with a few instances where the literal translation could have been refined.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major ideas from the French script are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory features, and the final conclusion. No significant content is omitted, and the dialogue remains concise. Minor linguistic glitches do not affect overall completeness.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is generally faithful and captures the essence of the original French script. It preserves the technical concepts and conversational tone while making the content accessible to a Spanish-speaking audience. Nonetheless, the mix of French terms within the Spanish text and some awkward phrasings reduce the overall fluidity. A final polish to eliminate the bilingual fragments and smooth out a few literal turns would bring the translation to an excellent level of quality. The scores reflect these strengths and weaknesses accordingly."
