  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally understandable, but several sentences suffer from grammatical errors (e.g., \"la IA no se afinan\") and awkward phrasing that can momentarily confuse readers. The overall flow is clear, but the presence of broken sentences reduces readability slightly. Score: 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly natural, but there are noticeable issues: missing subject‑verb agreement, repeated speaker labels, and a few literal mistranslations (e.g., \"le anclaje\" instead of \"grounding\"), which interrupt the natural rhythm. Score: 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly translated: \"preentrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"anclaje\". However, the inconsistent use of \"fine‑tuning\" (English) and \"afínamiento\" (Spanish) slightly detracts from consistency. Overall, terminology is handled well. Score: 17/20.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The dialogue style is preserved and cultural references are largely appropriate for Spanish speakers. Nevertheless, some sentences remain in French, and a few idiomatic expressions are not fully adapted (e.g., \"le anclaje\" could be \"el anclaje\"). This reduces contextual clarity. Score: 14/20.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several parts of the original are missing or mangled: the segment where the speaker says \"Telle est la réalité du ICL\" remains in French and the final lines are truncated. This results in loss of information and a confusing ending. Score: 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the main ideas of the original French script but is marred by grammatical mistakes, incomplete sections, and occasional French fragments that survive the translation. Technical terminology is mostly correct, but consistency and naturalness could be improved. With careful revision to remove errors and restore missing content, the translation could reach a high level of quality."
