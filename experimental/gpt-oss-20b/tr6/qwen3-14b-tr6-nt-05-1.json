    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version retains the logical flow of the original and uses clear, straightforward sentences. Most passages are easy to understand even for readers unfamiliar with technical jargon. However, a few sentences feel slightly clunky or redundant (e.g., “El aprendizaje en contexto, o ICL (In-Context Learning).”), which mildly lowers readability.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The overall style is quite natural for Spanish speakers. Minor awkwardities appear, such as “Vean esto:” (plural when the dialogue is singular) and occasional literal wording (“la IA se llama IA”) that can feel stilted. These do not significantly impede comprehension, but they detract from a fully polished feel.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: “fine‑tuning”, “aprender en contexto”, “anclaje (grounding)” and “memoria” are all accurate. Consistency is maintained across the transcript. Only small variations in word choice (e.g., “refinamiento” vs. “afinamiento”) occur but they are acceptable.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original tone and intent, adapting idiomatic expressions appropriately for a Spanish audience. Cultural references remain neutral, and the dialogue feels conversational. A few expressions could be further localized, but overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French transcript is present. No significant content is omitted, and the translation includes the same explanations and examples. Redundancy is minimal, and the content stays concise and clear.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is high‑quality, faithfully preserving the original meaning and technical details while maintaining readability for native speakers. Minor fluency issues and occasional literal phrasing slightly reduce the overall polish, but these do not materially affect comprehension. The translator demonstrates strong skill in handling jargon, context, and style, resulting in a coherent and accurate rendition of the source material."
