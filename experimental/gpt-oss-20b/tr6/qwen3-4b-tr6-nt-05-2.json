  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to read and the narrative flow is kept. The sentence structures are mostly clear, and the explanation of technical concepts is understandable for a lay audience. Some long sentences could be shortened for better readability, but overall the text is comprehensible.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several literal phrasing and grammatical quirks that make it sound slightly unnatural to native Spanish speakers. For instance, \"la IA no está constantemente afinada por sus conversaciones\" and the use of the French term \"antisèche\" interrupt the flow. Word choices like \"afinada\" for fine‑tuning are acceptable, but more idiomatic options would improve smoothness. Overall, the text is understandable but not fully natural.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinado\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"grounding\" (although translated as \"ancrage\") are appropriate. However, the French word \"antisèche\" is kept untranslated, and the term \"ancrage\" is not converted to the Spanish equivalent \"anclaje\". Consistency in the terminology could be improved, but the key concepts are still present.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and conversational tone. Some expressions were directly carried over from French, which might feel slightly formal or unfamiliar to Spanish speakers. Cultural adaptation could be enhanced by using more natural idioms and avoiding literal translations of foreign words. Nevertheless, the overall meaning is conveyed effectively.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French script are present in the Spanish version. No significant content was omitted. Minor omissions include the explicit mention of \"ventana de contexto\" before it is referenced, and the lack of a more explicit explanation of the term \"grounding\". These do not materially affect understanding, so the translation is largely complete.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation accurately captures the main ideas of the original French script and maintains a clear, conversational tone. It is readable and mostly fluent, though some literal phrasing and minor terminology inconsistencies detract from naturalness. The translation is comprehensive, with all essential information preserved. With a few refinements to phrasing and terminology, it would achieve a high level of polish for native Spanish audiences. Overall, the translation is solid but could benefit from smoothing out a few awkward expressions and ensuring consistent use of technical terms in Spanish equivalents. The average score is 16/20, reflecting a good but not perfect job of translation."
