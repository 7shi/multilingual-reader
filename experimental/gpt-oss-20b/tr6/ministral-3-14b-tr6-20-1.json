  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish dialogue follows the original structure closely, and the sentences are generally easy to follow. Some long sentences and occasional minor grammatical errors (e.g., “la IA no se afinan” instead of “no se afina”) slightly reduce clarity, but overall the target‑language readers can grasp the content without confusion.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds natural in many parts, but a few expressions feel slightly awkward for native speakers – such as the repeated capitalization of *Aprendizaje en Contexto* and the use of “afinamiento” instead of the more common *ajuste fino*. These choices do not break comprehension but affect smoothness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled with mostly correct Spanish equivalents: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprendizaje en contexto*, *anclaje*. The consistent use of these terms is commendable, though *afinamiento* is less idiomatic than *ajuste fino*. Overall terminology is appropriate and well explained.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the original intent and tone, adapting idiomatic references to a Spanish-speaking audience. Cultural nuances are respected, and the dialogue remains engaging. Minor stylistic adjustments (e.g., removing the extra quotation marks) could improve adaptation slightly.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French are present; no major omissions or distortions occur. Some small paraphrasing differences are acceptable and do not alter meaning. The text remains concise while staying informative.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation faithfully reproduces the meaning and flow of the French original. Minor grammatical slips and slightly non‑idiomatic word choices are the main areas for improvement. With these tweaks, the translation would achieve near‑perfect clarity and naturalness."
