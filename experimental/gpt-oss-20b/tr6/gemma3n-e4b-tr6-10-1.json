  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely intelligible; sentences are fairly long but the meaning follows the original.  Some parts (e.g., the explanation of the “memory” feature) feel slightly clunky, yet readers can still track the narrative without much effort.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the text reads smoothly, but there are a few unnatural expressions (e.g., “en una hoja de respuestas”) and typographical glitches (“se rfine”).  The capitalization of “Aprendizaje en Contexto” is inconsistent, and a few verb forms feel a bit stiff.  Overall, the translation would feel natural to a native speaker with minor edits.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled accurately: *fine‑tuning* → “afinamiento”, *transfer learning* → “aprendizaje por transferencia”, *context window* → “ventana de contexto”, *grounding* → “anclaje”, *ICL* → “aprendizaje en contexto”.  The terminology is consistent, though some could use the more common “ajuste fino” instead of “afinamiento”.  No key terms are omitted.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the conversational, informal tone appropriate for a podcast script.  Cultural references are minimal, and the text adapts well to Spanish listeners.  Minor phrasing such as “en una hoja de respuestas” could be smoothed, but overall the intent is preserved.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French original is present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, ICL, grounding, memory features, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge.  No substantive content is omitted, and the script remains concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is good overall.  It conveys the key concepts clearly and maintains the podcast’s conversational style.  To reach a higher quality, focus on polishing some phrasing, correcting typographical errors, and ensuring consistent use of terms and capitalization.  Minor adjustments would make the script feel fully natural to a native Spanish audience."
