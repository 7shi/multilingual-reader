  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely clear and logically structured. Sentences follow the original flow and key concepts are explained in a way that a Spanish‑speaking audience can understand. Minor readability issues arise from occasional literal phrasing (e.g., \"la IA no ha olvidado en el sentido humano del término\") that feels slightly formal but does not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the text reads smoothly, but some expressions feel slightly awkward or overly literal: \"el modelo en sí mismo no aprende ni evoluciona a partir de sus conversaciones\" (should reference the user), \"la IA no ha olvidado en el sentido humano del término\" is a direct translation of the French. Punctuation is generally correct, but a few sentences lack final punctuation. Overall, the translation is understandable but could benefit from polishing to achieve a more native cadence.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is handled correctly and consistently: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)\", \"anclaje\" for grounding, and \"memoria\" for memory. The translation retains the original meaning and provides no mistranslations or ambiguous terms. Some minor inconsistencies exist in the use of \"prompt\" as \"solicitud\", but overall terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts well to Spanish cultural context, avoiding direct French idioms and using Spanish equivalents. It maintains the conversational tone suitable for a podcast script. Some expressions remain very literal (e.g., \"consejo brillante\" vs \"consultor brillante\") which could be smoothed, but the intent and purpose of the original are preserved. The adaptation is solid but not perfectly natural in all places.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original text is present. The script’s structure, speaker lines, and key explanations remain intact. No major omissions occur; the only small gaps are minor punctuation issues and a slight shift in pronoun reference in one sentence. The translation successfully conveys the full content while remaining concise.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a strong grasp of the source material and successfully conveys its meaning in Spanish. While readability, terminology, and information completeness are excellent, the fluency could be improved by smoothing some literal phrasings and tightening punctuation. The result is a competent, mostly natural-sounding script suitable for a Spanish‑speaking audience, with a few areas for minor refinement to achieve full native polish."
