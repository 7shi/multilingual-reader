  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable, but several sentences are long, slightly fragmented, and contain minor grammatical errors (e.g., *informaciones* vs *información*, missing accents, abrupt punctuation). These issues make the flow less smooth, but readers can still grasp the overall message. The conversation style is preserved, and technical concepts are presented in a comprehensible way. 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several unnatural phrasings and inconsistencies that break the natural rhythm of Spanish. Examples: *la IA 'almacena temporalmente' estas informaciones* (plural for *información*), *marca la diferencia* (awkward), *tras bambalinas* (not common idiom). The word *prompt* is left untranslated, which is acceptable in tech contexts, but the surrounding sentences sometimes feel forced. Overall, the text sounds competent but not entirely fluent. 12/20.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered (pre‑entraînement → aprendizaje previo, fine‑tuning → afinamiento, grounding → anclaje). However, *In‑Context Learning* is incorrectly translated as *aprender por contexto* and abbreviated as *AIC* instead of *ICL*, which could confuse readers. The term *prompt* is retained but not adapted to *instrucción* or *indicaciones*, which would be clearer. Consistency is mostly good, but this key term mis‑translation is a notable flaw. 15/20.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The cultural adaptation is adequate for a general Spanish‑speaking audience: idioms such as *consultor brillante* and *anclaje* fit. However, some choices (e.g., *Memoria* capitalized, *tras bambalinas*) are less idiomatic. The adaptation preserves the informal, conversational tone of the original French podcast, but minor adjustments would improve naturalness. 13/20.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation conveys the core information of the original: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, the concept of grounding, the temporary vs permanent memory distinction, and the emerging memory feature. No major content is omitted, though the bike‑analogy is slightly less emphasized. Redundancies are minimal, and the text remains concise. 16/20.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is a solid first draft that captures the main ideas and conversational style of the original French script. It preserves key terminology and explains the learning processes clearly. However, it suffers from some awkward phrasing, grammatical inaccuracies, and a critical mis‑translation of the In‑Context Learning abbreviation. With targeted revisions—correcting plural forms, standardizing technical terms, smoothing sentence flow, and adjusting idiomatic expressions—the translation could reach a higher level of fluency and precision. Overall, it’s functional but needs polishing for a professional release."
