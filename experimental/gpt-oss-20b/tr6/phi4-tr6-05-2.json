  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally easy to follow. Sentences are mostly short and direct, and technical concepts are explained with appropriate analogies (e.g., the graduate/consultant metaphor). The only hiccups are a few slightly long clauses that could be split for smoother reading, but overall the Spanish audience can grasp the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the translation sounds natural to a native Spanish speaker. Some expressions feel slightly awkward – for example, the pair of questions “¿Entonces es una trampa? Camille: ¿Es entonces un truco?” is a literal carry‑over from the French and could be rephrased for smoother flow. Vocabulary choices are contemporary, but minor phrasing tweaks (e.g., “entonces” instead of “entonces”) would improve readability.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms are translated accurately: ‘pre‑entrenamiento’, ‘afinamiento’, ‘aprendizaje por transferencia’, ‘aprendizaje en contexto’, and ‘anclaje’. The translator maintains consistency throughout and provides adequate explanation for non‑expert readers. The only area for improvement is the use of “grounding” as “anclaje” – while correct, a brief parenthetical explanation could help readers unfamiliar with the term.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original tone and purpose – an explanatory podcast format. Cultural references are appropriate for a Spanish‑speaking audience, and idiomatic expressions (“recuerda el contexto pasado”) fit the context. A few minor adjustments (e.g., using “memoria” instead of “recuerdo” in some parts) could enhance clarity, but overall the adaptation is solid.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French original is present. The dialogue flow, explanations, and analogies are preserved. No significant content has been omitted, and unnecessary repetition has been avoided. The translation even adds a brief clarifying note at the beginning of the Spanish version, which improves accessibility.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a strong grasp of both the source material and the target language. It successfully preserves the explanatory intent, technical accuracy, and conversational tone of the original podcast. Minor stylistic adjustments would bring it to perfection, but as it stands, the translation is clear, fluent, and faithful to the source text. It is ready for publication with only a few polish edits needed for optimal readability and naturalness in Spanish. Overall, the translation achieves a high level of quality and should serve the intended audience well. The overall score reflects this high quality while acknowledging minor room for improvement in fluency and contextual phrasing: 18/20."
