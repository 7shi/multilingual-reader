  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely comprehensible for a general reader, but it suffers from repetitive phrasing, occasional missing articles, and a few sentences that are syntactically awkward or out of context (e.g. “La IA no se refina constantemente con tus conversaciones.”). The flow is logical, yet the reader may have to pause to decipher some passages, which reduces overall readability.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains several unnatural expressions and grammatical errors such as “se refina”, “se vuelve a recordar”, and inconsistent use of accents and punctuation. While many phrases sound natural, the cumulative effect of these mistakes makes the translation feel uneven and less smooth for native speakers.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are correctly rendered: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"ventana de contexto\". However, the translation uses the non‑standard \"Aprendizaje In‑Contexto\" and occasionally mislabels terms (e.g., “ajuste fino” is sometimes omitted or replaced with generic descriptions). Consistency could be improved.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator added new sentences that were not in the original (e.g., the paragraph beginning with \"El aprendizaje en contexto se refiere a…\"), and omitted a few subtle cultural references. While the core intent is retained, the adaptation introduces extraneous content and leaves some original nuances under‑communicated.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Key concepts such as grounding, memory, and the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge are present, but the translation contains duplicated sections and omits certain clarifications found in the original. The overall message is preserved, yet the redundancy and missing details reduce the completeness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is understandable but marred by repeated, awkward phrasing, some non‑standard terminology, and a few content inaccuracies. It captures the main ideas but fails to fully reflect the polish and precision of the original French text. Improvements in fluency, consistency of technical terms, and removal of unnecessary repetitions would raise the quality substantially. The translation is at a mid‑level proficiency and would benefit from a careful revision to achieve a smoother, more accurate rendition for native Spanish speakers.\n\nScore: 13/20 (average of the five criteria)."
