    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely clear and logical; the dialogue follows a natural conversational rhythm. Minor readability issues arise from a few awkward phrasings (“Es ahí donde reside todo el poder de esta enfoque” – missing *enfoque* and “Es como estudiar a la carrera” – unclear comparison). Overall, listeners/readers can understand the content without significant difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally reads smoothly. However, there are several small grammatical mistakes and non‑idiomatic constructions (“partes de un contexto vacío”, “Es ahí donde reside todo el poder de esta enfoque”, “El aprendizaje en contexto es como estudiar a la carrera”). These errors slightly disrupt the natural flow, but they do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently: *preentrenamiento*, *afinamiento*, *aprender por transferencia*, *in‑context learning* → *aprendizaje en contexto*, *grounding* → *anclaje*. The term *ICL* is left in parentheses in English, which is acceptable for a bilingual audience. Terminology matches the level of understanding expected from the target readers and remains coherent throughout the text.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation adapts cultural references appropriately: \"Tech Relámpago\" replaces the French title, a plausible Spanish equivalent that maintains the brand’s feel. Expressions are adapted for Spanish‑speaking listeners, though some brand names could have been kept unchanged. The overall intent of the podcast is preserved and the conversation flows naturally for a Spanish audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original are present. No significant information is omitted, and the translation adds no extraneous details. The content stays concise yet comprehensive, mirroring the structure of the original dialogue.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is of high quality, accurately conveying the technical concepts and conversational tone of the original French script. Minor grammatical errors and some non‑idiomatic phrasing slightly detract from an otherwise fluent and well‑adapted Spanish rendition. Overall, it meets the expectations for a professional podcast script translation with a few points for polishing the language style and consistency of brand names and terminology usage where appropriate. The translation successfully serves its intended Spanish‑speaking audience while preserving the nuance and humor of the original dialogue, making it suitable for broadcast or publication with only minimal editorial corrections needed to address the noted issues. The average score across all criteria is 18.4/20, rounded to 18/20 for overall evaluation. The translation’s strengths lie in its faithful rendering of technical terms, contextual adaptation, and clear conveyance of information, while its main weaknesses are the small grammatical slips that can be easily fixed with a final proofread. The text is ready for final use with these minor adjustments, ensuring a polished, native‑sounding listening experience for Spanish‑speaking audiences. This level of quality is commendable for a professional translation effort aimed at preserving both accuracy and readability for a non‑technical audience while retaining the nuance of a bilingual broadcast."
