    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, but it contains a few grammatical slips and awkward phrasing (e.g., “Lo han entendido todo”, “El aprendizaje en contexto es cramado”). These errors interrupt the flow and could confuse non‑native listeners. Despite that, the main ideas are clear and the sentence structure is mostly logical. Overall, readability is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally sounds natural for Spanish speakers, but several expressions feel contrived or incorrect: “cramado” instead of a more idiomatic term, “Lo han entendido todo” instead of “Lo has entendido todo”, and “Estas funciones de memorización son una forma astuciosa” which could be smoother. The overall flow is acceptable but the presence of these oddities reduces fluency.  ",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key terms are mostly retained correctly – preentrenamiento, fine‑tuning, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto, grounding (anclaje), memoria. However, there are minor issues: the word “cramado” is not a standard Spanish term, and “fine‑tuning” is sometimes left untranslated. The terminology is consistent enough for an informed audience, but some technical precision could be improved.  ",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original tone and conversational style, and it adapts culturally appropriate expressions (e.g., “consultor brillante”, “memoria a corto plazo”). Some phrases are slightly literal but overall it conveys the intended meaning effectively. Minor stylistic improvements could enhance readability for a native audience, yet the contextual adaptation is solid.  ",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the dialogue and explanations from the French source are present in the Spanish version. There are no omissions of key concepts, and the text is concise. The small errors do not affect the overall content, so the information completeness is high.  ",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and largely faithful to the original, preserving the structure, tone, and technical content. Nonetheless, it suffers from a handful of grammatical mistakes and occasional awkward phrasing that slightly diminish readability and fluency. With minor editing, the Spanish version would be clear, natural, and fully aligned with the source material. Overall, the translation demonstrates solid work but would benefit from a careful proof‑read to polish the language and terminology nuances.  "
