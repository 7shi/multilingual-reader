  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely easy to read. Sentences are generally short and follow a logical order. Some phrases feel slightly formal (e.g., \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\") but do not hinder comprehension. Overall, the dialogue flows naturally for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds quite natural and uses contemporary vocabulary. Minor awkwardness appears in a few constructions, such as \"Usted lo ha entendido todo\" and the occasional over‑literal translation of idioms. Nonetheless, the text reads smoothly and would feel familiar to native speakers.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled consistently and appropriately: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" (ICL), and \"ventana de contexto\". The abbreviation ICL is preserved, which is acceptable in a technical context. Explanations for specialized terms are clear and adapted to the target audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator has adapted cultural references and idiomatic expressions to Spanish (e.g., \"consultor brillante\" instead of a literal translation). The meaning of the original French is retained and the adapted wording fits a Spanish‑speaking audience, though a few phrases could be further localized for colloquial flair.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original script is present. No content is omitted, and the dialogue retains its structure and nuance. Minor formatting differences (e.g., punctuation) do not affect the conveyed message.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is very good, preserving the original meaning, structure, and technical accuracy. Minor naturalness issues and small stylistic inconsistencies are present but do not impede overall comprehension. The translator has successfully adapted the text for a Spanish‑speaking audience while keeping all key details intact. Overall, the Spanish version is clear, fluent, and faithful to the source material, with room for minor stylistic polishing to reach near‑perfect fluency and localization nuance. The translation demonstrates strong language skills and a solid understanding of the technical concepts discussed in the original French podcast script.  Overall score: 17.4/20.  This reflects an excellent translation that could be used in a professional context with minimal adjustments for idiomatic polish."
