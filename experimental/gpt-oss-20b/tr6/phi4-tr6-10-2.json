    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to read and follows the overall structure of the original. Sentences are logically organized, and the dialogue flow is clear. Some compound sentences could be simplified for even smoother comprehension, but overall the target audience can follow the content without confusion.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural for a Spanish-speaking audience, with appropriate idiomatic expressions such as \"se abre una nueva ventana\" and \"se afina\". A few phrases are slightly literal, e.g., \"la IA no se afinaría constantemente mediante tus conversaciones\", which could be rephrased as \"la IA no se reentrenaría constantemente con tus conversaciones\". Minor grammatical slips also appear (e.g., missing accent marks in some words). Overall, the text reads smoothly, but some refinements would improve fluency.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled accurately and consistently: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"fine-tuning\" → \"afinamiento\", \"ICL\" → \"Aprendizaje en contexto\", \"grounding\" → \"anclaje\". The translation includes brief contextual explanations when necessary, and the terminology aligns with common usage among Spanish-speaking tech audiences.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains the intent and tone of the original podcast script. Cultural adaptation is appropriate; references to consulting, training, and memory are expressed in a way that Spanish listeners would understand. A few expressions could be adapted further to match colloquial speech (e.g., using \"reentrenar\" instead of \"afinar\" in some contexts), but the overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key points from the original French transcript are present: pre-training, fine-tuning, transfer learning, in-context learning, grounding, the nature of temporary vs permanent knowledge, and the emerging memory feature. No substantive information is omitted, and the translation maintains the same level of detail. Some redundant phrases are streamlined, keeping the content concise yet clear.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful and comprehensible, preserving the technical nuances and conversational tone of the original French script.
