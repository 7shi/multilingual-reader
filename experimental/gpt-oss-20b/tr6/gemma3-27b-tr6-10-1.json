    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version keeps the dialogue structure and logical flow of the original. Sentences are generally short and easy to follow. Some minor punctuation quirks appear, but overall readers can grasp the content without difficulty. The use of everyday language makes complex concepts approachable.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally for a native Spanish speaker. Word choice and idiomatic expressions are largely appropriate. There are a few awkward phrasings, such as “la IA no ha ‘olvidado’ en el sentido humano del término; su espacio de trabajo temporal simplemente ha sido vaciado” and repetition of “lo olvida todo.” Grammar slips like “una conocimiento” instead of “un conocimiento” slightly interrupt flow. Overall, the translation feels smooth but not flawless.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are generally handled correctly: ‘preentrenamiento’, ‘ajuste fino’, ‘aprendizaje por transferencia’, ‘aprendizaje en contexto’, ‘memoria a corto plazo’. The word ‘grounding’ is left in English, which is acceptable but could be translated to ‘fundamentación’ or ‘anclaje’. Inconsistent article usage (‘una conocimiento’) and a minor inconsistency with ‘ajuste fino’ vs ‘fine-tuning’ (English term not used). Terminology remains comprehensible to the target audience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects cultural expectations of a Spanish-speaking audience, avoiding French idioms and replacing them with Spanish equivalents. The tone is conversational, matching the original podcast style. Minor cultural adjustments, such as phrasing “consultor brillante” instead of a literal translation, improve relatability. Overall adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French transcript are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory features, and the analogy between temporary and permanent knowledge. No substantive content is omitted. A small omission is the explicit mention that the memory feature is “automated in‑context learning” – the Spanish text implies this but could be more explicit. Redundancy is minimal.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is of high quality and faithfully conveys the content, tone, and technical nuances of the original French podcast. Minor grammatical and stylistic imperfections slightly reduce the naturalness of the text, but these do not hinder comprehension. With minor editorial polish—correcting article usage, smoothing a few phrases, and translating ‘grounding’—the translation would be excellent."
