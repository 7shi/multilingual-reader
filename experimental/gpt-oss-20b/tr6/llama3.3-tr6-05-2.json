    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is generally easy to follow and the key concepts are presented in a clear, logical order. However, some sentences are long and a few minor grammatical errors (e.g., missing accents, slight word order issues) slightly impede fluency. The text is largely comprehensible for a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads mostly naturally, but there are a handful of awkward phrasings such as \"proporcionarle los documentos de información exactos\" and \"enraizamiento\" which feel slightly contrived. Overall the flow is good, yet the prose could be smoothed out in places.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely handled correctly – \"preentrenamiento\", \"afinamiento\", \"aprendizaje por transferencia\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" – but the choice of \"enraizamiento\" for \"grounding\" is less common. Consistency is maintained across the text, and explanations are generally provided when needed.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation captures the original intent and tone, and it uses Spanish idioms that fit the context. Some cultural nuances (e.g., informal phrasing in certain sections) could be refined, but the overall adaptation is adequate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the original French are present; no substantive omissions. There is slight redundancy in the repeated “Luc” dialogues, but this does not detract from the overall clarity. Minor details (e.g., the explanation of ICL’s memory function) are preserved.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is competent and conveys the core ideas with minimal loss of meaning. Minor grammatical and stylistic adjustments would improve readability and naturalness, but the current version is functional for a native Spanish audience."
