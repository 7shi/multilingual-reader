  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text largely follows the original structure and conveys the main ideas, but it suffers from frequent interruptions by editorial comments, missing punctuation, and occasionally omitted sentences. The flow is disrupted, and the reader may struggle to follow the conversation at a glance. Still, most sentences are comprehensible.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Several awkward or incorrect phrases appear, such as \"la IA se afila\" (should be \"se afina\"), \"una forma astucieza\" (non‑existent word), and inconsistent verb tense. Some parts read like literal word‑for‑word translations rather than natural Spanish. Overall, the prose is understandable but not smooth.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly preserved (e.g., \"aprendizaje en contexto\", \"fine‑tuning\"), but the translation mixes English and Spanish in a confusing way, uses \"anchorage\" instead of the more common \"anclaje\" or \"fundamentación\", and occasionally omits or misrepresents key concepts (e.g., \"memoria a corto plazo\" is correct, but \"Memoria\" feature is not clearly described). Consistency is lacking.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the general tone of a podcast but fails to adapt certain cultural references or idiomatic expressions. For instance, the metaphor about a consultant and the bicycle lesson are kept, yet the Spanish wording feels literal. Some colloquial phrasing could be improved for naturalness.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Several portions of the original dialogue are missing or fragmented (e.g., the transition after \"anchor\" and the conclusion). Some sentences appear twice, and editorial notes are inserted into the translation. As a result, important details are omitted or repeated unnecessarily.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation captures the overall gist but suffers from numerous inconsistencies, missing content, and awkward phrasing. It would benefit from a thorough revision to improve flow, correct terminology, and ensure all original information is preserved."
