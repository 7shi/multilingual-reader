    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally clear and follows a logical sentence structure that most Spanish readers can understand. Some minor omissions (e.g., “las habilidades matemáticas” in the transfer‑learning paragraph) and the accidental inclusion of the fragment “Final Translation:” make a few sentences feel slightly disjointed. Overall, the content remains comprehensible but could be polished for smoother flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The language is largely natural and contemporary, but there are a handful of awkward expressions: the stray “Final Translation:” header, the untranslated word “ancrage”, and a few literal literal translations that sound slightly stiff (e.g., “la ventana de contexto” rather than “el contexto de ventana”). These quirks reduce the smoothness a bit. A native speaker would recognize the meaning but might find the phrasing slightly unnatural in places.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as *preentrenamiento*, *ajuste fino*, *aprendizaje por transferencia*, and *ICL* are correctly rendered. However, the word “ancrage” (grounding) is left untranslated, and the phrase “transfere sus habilidades matemáticas” is omitted. Consistency is good overall, but these minor gaps affect terminology completeness.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original’s tone and intent, using idiomatic Spanish where appropriate. Some cultural nuances could be improved (e.g., “consultor brillante” could be “consultor experto”), but the overall message is preserved. The accidental English/Spanish mix (“ancrage”) detracts from the adaptation.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original information is present, but a few details are missing or altered: the explicit mention of “habilidades matemáticas” in the transfer‑learning example, the translation of “ancrage,” and the extraneous “Final Translation:” phrase. These omissions slightly reduce the completeness of the content.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation is largely faithful and understandable, but it contains a handful of minor errors and omissions that affect fluency, terminology consistency, and completeness. With a few corrections—particularly translating the term “ancrage,” adding the omitted “habilidades matemáticas,” and removing the stray header—the text would be a polished, fully accurate rendition of the original French script."
