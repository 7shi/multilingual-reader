  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to read and understand. Sentence structures mirror the original, and technical concepts are explained clearly. Minor issues such as the slightly abrupt sentence \"La IA no se afina constantemente con sus conversaciones.\" could be smoothed out, but overall readability is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads naturally for native Spanish speakers. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary. A few expressions feel slightly literal, e.g., \"El aprendizaje en contexto es un bachotaje,\" which is understandable but could be rendered more idiomatically. No major grammatical errors.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled correctly: \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", \"ventana de contexto\", \"In‑Context Learning (ICL)\". The same terminology is consistently used throughout. Minor omission of \"increíblemente\" in one sentence does not affect comprehension.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains the original intent and conversational tone. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is straightforward. The translation could improve idiomatic flow in a few spots, but it effectively conveys the original meaning to a Spanish-speaking audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key information from the French original is present. No content was omitted. Minor wording differences (e.g., \"Sería ineficiente\" vs. \"sería increíblemente ineficiente\") do not change the meaning. The translation remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "Overall, the translation is of very high quality. It preserves the original meaning, uses appropriate technical terminology, and reads smoothly for Spanish-speaking audiences. A few minor idiomatic adjustments could further polish the text, but it already meets professional standards for clarity and fidelity to the source material. The total score reflects its strong performance across all evaluated dimensions: 92 out of 100 points."
