  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version contains extensive fragments of nonsense text (the repeated “Cartesian” block) that interrupt the flow and make the narrative impossible to follow. Even the parts that are legible are jumbled and lack logical sentence structure. Readers would struggle to comprehend the intended meaning, especially for complex concepts like pre‑training or fine‑tuning. Hence, the readability is very low.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The language that is present often sounds mechanical or awkward. There are multiple instances of incorrect word order, missing articles, and non‑standard phrasing (e.g., “la IA no ha olvidado en el sentido humano del término” instead of a more natural construction). The repeated nonsense also contributes to a lack of flow, making the overall text feel far from natural for a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Some technical terms are translated appropriately (e.g., “pre-entrenamiento,” “ajuste fino,” “aprendizaje por transferencia,” “aprendizaje en contexto,” “anclaje”). However, because large portions of the text are corrupted, it is impossible to assess whether the terminology is consistently applied throughout. The presence of the garbled block also means that certain terms are either omitted or misrepresented, which reduces overall terminology quality.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The script’s intent – explaining AI concepts in a conversational podcast format – is not effectively conveyed due to the nonsensical sections. Cultural adaptation (e.g., using idiomatic Spanish for “consultor brillante”) is largely missing or incorrectly rendered. The text fails to consider the target audience’s cultural context and does not optimize expressions for Spanish‑speaking listeners.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Key parts of the original dialogue are missing or overwritten by the repeated “Cartesian” nonsense. Critical explanations about how pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning work are largely omitted or garbled, leaving the reader with an incomplete understanding of the topic.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is severely flawed. The presence of a large block of unrelated, repetitive text disrupts readability, fluency, and completeness. While some terminology is handled correctly, the overall coherence and context are lost, making the text unsuitable for listeners who expect a clear, natural, and accurate explanation of AI concepts in Spanish. Significant revision is required to restore the script to a usable state. 12/100 total points overall (score out of 100).  (Score out of 100 is computed by averaging the six criteria: (4+5+10+5+4)/5 = 28/5 = 5.6? Actually we need overall comment, not score out of 100.)"
