  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely understandable to a native audience. The sentences are mostly short and the dialogue structure is clear. Some parts, however, use slightly awkward phrasing or break the flow (e.g., “Enseñarías matemáticas básicas a un brillante físico antes de que se aboque a la mecánica cuántica”). Overall, the content is comprehensible but could be smoother.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation uses correct Spanish grammar in most places, but several expressions feel unnatural for a native speaker: \"fíjense\" instead of \"observa\", repetition of “es como”, and occasional missing accents or prepositions. The overall tone is conversational but occasionally stilted.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are handled appropriately: \"pre‑entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" for ICL, etc. The terms are consistent throughout and aligned with common Spanish NLP terminology. Minor inconsistencies (e.g., using \"ajuste fino\" once and \"ajuste fino\" elsewhere) are negligible.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the original intent and structure, adapting references (e.g., “un brillante físico”) to a Spanish context. Cultural references are minimal, so adaptation is adequate. The dialogue remains engaging, though a few colloquial choices could be tweaked for a more natural feel.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All major points from the French original are present: pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory features, and the consultant versus expert analogy. No essential information is omitted, though a few minor phrasing adjustments could reduce redundancy.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the meaning of the original fairly well. There are some awkward expressions and minor inconsistencies that could be polished, but overall the content is clear, accurate, and appropriately technical for a Spanish-speaking audience. Refinements in fluency and a few phrasing tweaks would raise the quality to a near‑native level."
