  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely clear and easy to follow. Sentences are mostly straightforward, and the explanation of complex concepts such as pre‑training and fine‑tuning is understandable. Minor issues—like the inconsistent use of the verb tense in “aprende / aprenderá” and the slightly awkward phrasing “a la nueva tarea específica”—do not obstruct comprehension but mildly affect readability.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads naturally for a native Spanish speaker. However, there are a few small problems: a typo in ‘rfine’ instead of ‘refina’, a misspelling of ‘Transformers’ as ‘Transformeers’, and some slightly stilted expressions (e.g., ‘aprenderá francés a una velocidad increíble’). Overall the translation is fluent but not flawless.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely preserved and correctly translated: pre‑entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, ventana de contexto, in‑context learning → aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje. The only real slip is the misspelling of ‘Transformers’. The terminology is consistent and appropriate for a lay audience.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation keeps the conversational tone of the original podcast and adapts expressions to Spanish idioms (e.g., ‘consultor brillante’, ‘memoria a corto plazo’). Cultural references are handled correctly. A few expressions could be polished for local nuance, but overall the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the French original is present in the Spanish version. There are no omissions, and the content remains concise. The only issue is a typo that could momentarily confuse the reader, but the overall message is intact.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the original meaning well and is mostly fluent, but contains a few small errors and occasional awkward phrasing. With minor corrections—especially fixing typos and polishing tense usage—the translation would achieve a higher quality score. It is adequate for a general audience and respects the intent and style of the source material, but some polish is needed to reach a professional standard of Spanish localization. Overall, a solid effort that would benefit from a final proofreading pass to eliminate typographical mistakes and tighten a few expressions for naturalness and consistency."
