  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable, but the frequent insertion of untranslated French fragments interrupts the flow and can confuse readers who do not understand French. The sentence structure is generally correct, yet the interleaved French makes it harder to read the entire dialogue seamlessly.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While many parts of the translation read naturally, the presence of untranslated French sentences and occasional literal phrasing (e.g., \"L'apprentissage par transfert est la clé\") reduces overall fluency. The speaker turns also feel slightly disjointed because of the back‑and‑forth switching between languages.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"preentrenamiento\", \"fine‑tuning\", and \"aprendizaje por transferencia\" are correctly rendered. However, the repeated insertion of French terminology undermines consistency and introduces ambiguity for readers unfamiliar with the original language. Consistency could be improved by fully translating these segments.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation preserves the overall intent and tone of the podcast. Nonetheless, the inadvertent mix of French text reduces clarity for the target audience and detracts from a fully contextualized adaptation. Cultural references are correctly retained, but the bilingual interference detracts from the polished adaptation expected for a Spanish‑speaking audience.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Essential information is largely preserved, but the repeated French fragments obscure the meaning of several sections. Some explanatory paraphrases present in the original are missing or left untranslated, which could lead to misunderstandings. The content is not fully complete as a reader would expect a fully translated script.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates a good grasp of the source material and correctly handles most of the terminology, yet it is compromised by the repeated inclusion of untranslated French text. This not only interrupts readability and fluency but also hampers the sense of completeness and consistency. A clean, fully Spanish version would considerably improve the listener’s experience and the professional quality of the podcast transcript. Overall, the effort is commendable but requires a thorough revision to correct the language intermixing and ensure a seamless, accurate translation for Spanish‑speaking audiences."
