    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is largely understandable: the core ideas are conveyed and the dialogue structure remains clear. However, a few sentences are awkwardly phrased or contain typographical errors that slightly hinder readability (e.g., \"La IA no se rfine…\" and \"vuestras conversaciones\"). Overall, most readers can follow the conversation without major confusion, but the flow would benefit from smoothing some literal turns.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text sounds fairly natural in many parts, but there are several issues that break the flow: missing accents, the use of \"vuestras\" in a mixed‑gender context, a typo in \"rfine\", and some literal translations that feel mechanical (e.g., \"libreta de apuntes\"). These elements make the piece feel slightly disjointed to a native reader. A polished version would read more smoothly.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terminology is mostly handled correctly: \"pre-entrenamiento\", \"ajuste fino\", \"ventana de contexto\", and \"aprendizaje en contexto\" are appropriate and consistent. The only minor slip is the omission of a space in \"In-Context Learning\" (it appears as a single phrase) and the slightly odd choice of \"memorización\" for a feature named \"Memory\". Nonetheless, the key concepts are translated accurately.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation respects the original intent and keeps the dialogue tone. Some cultural adaptation could be improved—for instance, using a more natural greeting such as \"Hola y bienvenidos/as\" instead of the literal \"Hola y bienvenido/as\". Also, the phrase \"vuestras conversaciones\" feels less natural than simply \"tus conversaciones\". The overall cultural nuance is preserved, but small adjustments would enhance resonance with Spanish‑speaking audiences.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all information from the source is present. The only noticeable omission is the brief mention of the \"expansion massive of short‑term memory\" in the context of the ICL explanation, which is still present but could be more explicitly tied to the concept. Redundancy is minimal, and the core content is kept concise. Thus the translation is largely complete.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish version captures the main ideas and dialogue structure, but it contains a handful of grammatical errors and slightly awkward phrasing that reduce fluency and readability. The technical terminology is largely correct, though a few expressions could be refined. With minor polishing, the translation would read naturally to native Spanish speakers while faithfully conveying the original content."
