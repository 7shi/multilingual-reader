  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is mostly understandable and follows a logical progression, but some sentences feel abrupt and occasionally lack connectors. The dialogue format is preserved, and the overall meaning is clear, though a few expressions could be smoother.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text contains several grammatical slips (e.g., \"La IA no se afinan\" instead of \"La IA no se afina\") and odd repetitions such as \"Luc: Luc\". Some phrases sound literal rather than idiomatic, which slightly reduces naturalness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms (pre-entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje en contexto, anclaje) are correctly rendered and consistently used. Minor inconsistencies arise with the occasional omission of parenthetical explanations (e.g., ICL). Overall, terminology is appropriate.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Cultural adaptation is adequate; the dialogue tone matches a podcast setting. However, some expressions feel too literal (e.g., “para darle una cultura general”), and a few idiomatic equivalents could enhance relatability for Spanish speakers.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation retains all major points from the original and does not omit key information. Some small phrasing differences exist, but the overall content and intent remain intact. Redundancy is minimal, and the text stays concise.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation successfully conveys the original podcast’s content and dialogue structure. It is largely comprehensible, but a few grammatical errors and slightly awkward phrasing detract from its fluency. Terminology handling is solid, and cultural adaptation is largely appropriate. With minor polishing—especially correcting repeated speaker labels and smoothing out a few literal turns—the translation would reach a professional level of quality for native Spanish audiences.\n\nOverall, this is a competent translation that captures the essence of the original while maintaining readability and technical accuracy, though some refinements are needed for full naturalness and polish.\n\nScore (average of criteria): 16/20"
