    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is fragmented, containing isolated sentences that do not form a coherent narrative. Many lines are out of context or are nonsensical (“El texto traducido al español es: 'El cielo está azul.'”). As a result, readers would struggle to follow the dialogue or grasp the flow of the podcast. Score: 4/20.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The language is clunky, with abrupt jumps between topics and sentences that read like a list rather than a natural conversation. Unnecessary placeholders such as “El perro corre rápido por el parque.” disrupt the flow. The translation lacks the smooth, conversational tone expected of a podcast script in Spanish. Score: 3/20.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms are either missing or incorrectly rendered. For example, “preentrenamiento” is used correctly, but “in‑context learning” is rendered as a mix of English and Spanish (“aprendizaje en contexto”) without explanation. There is no consistent treatment of terms like “fine‑tuning”, “grounding”, or “context window.” The translation omits important terminology from the original and fails to provide clarifications when needed. Score: 2/20.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to capture the original intent and comedic tone. Cultural references and informal dialogue are lost or replaced with irrelevant content. The script’s structure, which relies on a back‑and‑forth exchange, is broken, leading to a lack of contextual relevance for Spanish‑speaking audiences. Score: 3/20.",
      "score": 3
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Significant portions of the original dialogue are omitted or replaced with unrelated lines. The essential narrative about pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning is either missing or fragmented. Consequently, the Spanish version does not convey the full story. Score: 1/20.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is substantially incomplete and incoherent, providing a disjointed mix of unrelated sentences and placeholders. It fails to preserve the original dialogue’s structure, meaning, and technical accuracy. A comprehensive rewrite is required to deliver a fluent, contextually appropriate, and complete Spanish script for the podcast."
