  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish version is very readable for native speakers. Sentences are generally clear, the dialogue flow is preserved, and complex ideas are explained in a straightforward way. Minor syntactic oddities (e.g., slightly wordy constructions) do not impede comprehension. Overall, the text is easy to follow and the structure is logical.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads well and most expressions sound natural. However, a few spots feel slightly mechanical or contain minor punctuation inconsistencies. For example, the phrase “la IA no se afina constantemente con tus conversaciones. Sería increíblemente ineficiente.” could be smoothed as a single sentence. Vocabulary is appropriate, but some word choices (like “enraizamiento”) are uncommon. Still, the overall fluency is high.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are largely translated correctly: “preentrenamiento,” “afinamiento,” “aprendizaje en contexto,” and “grounding” (as “enraizamiento”). The term “enraizamiento” is not standard in Spanish technical literature (where “anclaje” or “contextualización” are more common). The rest of the terminology is accurate, consistent, and adapted to the target audience’s understanding level.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translator preserves the original intent, tone, and cultural references. The use of colloquial expressions like “siempre” or “poco” matches everyday Spanish. The dialogue format is maintained, and the names remain unchanged. Minor cultural adaptations (e.g., replacing “chatbot” with “chatbot” rather than “robot conversacional”) keep the text relatable. Overall, the adaptation is effective.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All dialogue lines from the French source appear in the Spanish version. No substantive content is omitted, and the narrative flow remains intact. The translator provides necessary explanations (e.g., why “In‑Context Learning” works). There is no redundant repetition beyond what is present in the source. Thus, the information coverage is complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The Spanish translation of the podcast script is strong and faithful to the original. It is highly readable and conveys all technical concepts accurately. Minor fluency tweaks and a more conventional term for “grounding” would improve the naturalness, but overall it delivers a clear, engaging, and technically sound adaptation for Spanish‑speaking audiences. The translator demonstrates good command of both languages and a solid understanding of the subject matter, resulting in a translation that is both accessible and informative. The final quality would merit an overall rating of 18/20, reflecting its near‑perfect alignment with the source text while acknowledging a few small stylistic improvements that could be made."
