  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is mostly clear and easy to understand. The structure follows the original dialogue, and complex ideas such as pre‑training, fine‑tuning, and in‑context learning are explained in a straightforward way. Minor issues—like the abrupt “Veo.” and occasional missing articles—do not hinder comprehension, but they slightly disrupt the flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation reads fairly naturally for native Spanish speakers, but several awkward expressions appear: the inserted “Luc afirma:”, the stray “apri” typo, and the inconsistent punctuation. These quirks interrupt the smoothness of the dialogue and make some sentences feel forced. Overall fluency is good but not flawless.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are mostly handled correctly: pre‑training → pre‑entrenamiento, fine‑tuning → especialización, in‑context learning → aprendizaje en contexto, grounding → anclaje, etc. The choices are appropriate for a general audience and consistent across the script. Minor lapses include the hyphenation of pre‑entrenamiento and the misspelling “apri,” but these do not affect the understanding of key terms.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "Cultural adaptation is adequate: the dialogue uses idiomatic Spanish, keeps the informal podcast tone, and references familiar concepts. The only notable deviation is the wrong title “Tech Rápido” instead of “Tech Éclair,” which could confuse listeners but does not alter the meaning. Overall, the translation respects the target culture.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translated version retains all essential content from the original. All major ideas—pre‑training, fine‑tuning, transfer learning, in‑context learning, memory mechanisms—are present. Small omissions include a more explicit mention of “grounding” in the context section, and some explanatory nuance around the memory feature is slightly compressed. No critical information is missing.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and conveys the technical content accurately for a Spanish‑speaking audience. However, it suffers from a few typographical errors, unnatural phrasing, and a misplaced title that diminish its overall polish. With minor revisions—correcting typos, smoothing dialogue, and fixing the program name—the translation would be excellent."
