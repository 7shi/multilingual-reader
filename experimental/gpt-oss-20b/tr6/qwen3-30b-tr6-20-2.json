  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is fragmented, missing logical flow, and contains unrelated sentences. Readers would struggle to follow the narrative, so readability is low. Score: 6/20.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation exhibits many unnatural phrasings, incorrect word choices (e.g., \"El texto traducido al español es: 'El cielo está azul.'\" is irrelevant), and inconsistent grammar. Overall fluency is poor. Score: 5/20.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Some key technical terms are correctly rendered (pre-entrenamiento, ajuste fino, aprendizaje por transferencia, aprendizaje en contexto), but the usage is inconsistent and the translation often omits or distorts terms. In addition, unrelated phrases appear. Score: 7/20.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to preserve the conversational, podcast style of the original, and many cultural references or humor are lost. The target audience would not feel the intended tone. Score: 5/20.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Large portions of the original content are omitted, while extraneous sentences (e.g., \"El perro corre rápido por el parque.\") are added. Critical explanations about ICL and memory are missing or incorrect. Score: 4/20.",
      "score": 4
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation demonstrates significant deficiencies in structure, fidelity, and clarity. It is incomplete, contains unrelated content, and lacks the natural flow expected of a Spanish rendition of a podcast transcript. It would need substantial revision to meet professional standards for accuracy and readability. Overall, the quality is below acceptable thresholds for any formal or public use. The cumulative score is 27/100, indicating a very poor translation."
