  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is largely easy to read and the sentence structure follows the original order closely, making it straightforward for native readers to follow the dialogue. However, some long sentences could be split for smoother flow. Overall readability is high.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation sounds natural in most places, with appropriate use of idioms and contemporary vocabulary. Minor issues arise from a few literal phrasings (e.g., \"en la memoria a corto plazo de la IA\") and occasional punctuation choices, but these do not impede comprehension.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms such as \"entrenamiento previo\", \"aprendizaje en contexto\" and \"ventana de contexto\" are correctly rendered. However, the English term \"fine‑tuning\" is left untranslated in several spots, creating inconsistency. Also, the term \"anclaje\" could have been paired with the original \"grounding\" more clearly. Overall, terminology is good but not perfect.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The cultural adaptation is appropriate: gender‑inclusive greetings, Spanish punctuation, and local phrasing are used. The overall intent and tone of the original podcast are preserved. No major cultural misfits were found.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All lines from the French source are present in the Spanish version, with no omitted explanations or major paraphrasing that changes meaning. Redundancies are minimal, and the translation remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is solid and largely faithful to the original. It maintains readability, naturalness, and completeness, with only minor issues in terminology consistency and a few slightly stiff phrases. Overall, it would be well received by a Spanish-speaking audience familiar with tech podcasts. Minor post‑editing could bring the score even higher, but the current version is excellent for practical use in a podcast context. The translation successfully captures the dialogue’s informal, conversational tone while preserving technical clarity. It balances literal fidelity with natural expression, making it both understandable and engaging for the target readers. Minor adjustments to uniform terminology (e.g., translating \"fine‑tuning\" consistently) would enhance consistency, but the overall quality is strong. The final overall rating reflects the translation’s high quality and readiness for publication with only light editorial tweaks needed."
