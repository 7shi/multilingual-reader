    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally easy to understand with clear sentence structures. However, the inconsistent use of formal and informal address ('tú', 'usted', 'ustedes') to the listener occasionally disrupts the flow and makes certain passages less natural to read. A typo ('leys' instead of 'leyes') also impacts readability slightly.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The most significant issue affecting fluency is the inconsistent addressing of the listener. The original French 'vous' is translated sometimes as 'tú' (informal singular), sometimes 'usted' (formal singular), and sometimes 'ustedes' (formal plural). This creates an uneven and unnatural listening/reading experience for a native Spanish speaker. Phrases like 'Eso es por lo que' for 'C'est pourquoi' and the word order in 'permanecen en todas las conversaciones siempre' are slightly clunky. The added explanatory sentence for 'preentrenamiento' also slightly breaks the conversational rhythm of the podcast.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms like 'preentrenamiento', 'afinamiento (ajuste fino)', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)', and 'anclaje (grounding)' are mostly handled well and appropriately. The inclusion of the English equivalent 'fine-tuning' and 'grounding' is a good practice. However, there's an inconsistency in translating 'apprentissage par transfert': Camille's line uses 'aprendizaje transferido' while Luc's immediately following line correctly uses 'aprendizaje por transferencia', which is the standard term. This minor inconsistency affects overall terminology consistency.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and purpose of the podcast dialogue are effectively conveyed. The informal, conversational tone is mostly maintained. The adaptation of 'antisèche' to 'hoja de referencias' is a good contextual choice. However, the inconsistent formal/informal address directly impacts contextual adaptation, as it changes the perceived relationship between the speakers and the audience in a confusing way. A consistent choice (e.g., all 'ustedes' for a podcast audience) would have been more appropriate.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original text is conveyed without any omissions. The translation even includes a slight elaboration for 'preentrenamiento' and 'aprendizaje en contexto (ICL)', which while slightly affecting fluency, adds to clarity and understanding without introducing redundancy. No critical information is missing.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation accurately conveys the technical information and the general flow of the podcast. However, its quality is significantly hampered by inconsistent address to the listener (switching between 'tú', 'usted', and 'ustedes'), which creates an unnatural and occasionally confusing reading experience. Some minor grammatical issues and awkward phrasing also detract from its fluency. While technically complete, the translation lacks the polish and naturalness expected for a podcast script."
