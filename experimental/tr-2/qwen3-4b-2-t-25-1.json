    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is generally understandable, but several awkward phrasings and grammatical errors (e.g., subject-verb agreement, gender/number agreement, repeated use of 'informaciones' instead of 'información') hinder smooth reading. Some sentences feel like direct translations rather than naturally flowing Spanish.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text lacks naturalness in several instances. Common grammatical errors like 'bienvenido en' instead of 'bienvenido a', 'se ataque a' instead of 'se enfrente a', and 'La IA no se afinan' instead of 'La IA no se afina' are present. The phrasing 'es del aprendizaje a partir del contexto' for an analogy is particularly awkward and unidiomatic. Vocabulary choices like 'bien menor' are direct translations that could be improved. The translation of 'antisèche' as 'una preparación' loses the intended nuance of a 'cheat sheet'.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While most technical terms like 'preentrenamiento', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', and 'aprendizaje en contexto' are correctly translated, there is a significant inconsistency with 'affinage' (fine-tuning). It is initially correctly translated as 'afinado' (ajuste fino), but later incorrectly translated as 'entrenamiento', which is a generic term for training and disrupts the technical accuracy and consistency. The nuances of 'bachotage' and 'antisèche' are also not fully captured by their Spanish equivalents, which are crucial for the explanations.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The core intent and purpose of explaining AI concepts are conveyed. However, the translation struggles with adapting idiomatic expressions and analogies, particularly 'bachotage' and 'antisèche'. The failure to convey the precise meaning of these analogies detracts from the clarity of the explanation regarding temporary versus permanent knowledge, which is a key point in the original podcast.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All critical information from the original text is present in the translation. There are no significant omissions or unnecessary additions. However, the imprecise translation of certain analogies (like 'cramming' for an exam or a 'cheat sheet') means that the *full impact* and *nuance* of some explanations are not completely conveyed, slightly impacting the overall clarity of the information presented.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully conveys the main technical information and follows the structure of the original dialogue. However, it is significantly hampered by numerous grammatical errors (e.g., subject-verb agreement, gender/number agreement, consistent misuse of 'informaciones' for 'información'), unnatural phrasing, and a critical inconsistency in the translation of 'fine-tuning' ('affinage'). The failure to adequately translate idiomatic expressions and analogies also detracts from the natural flow and clarity of the conversation. It reads more like a literal translation than a polished, natural Spanish text."
