    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally clear and easy to understand, with logical sentence structures that follow Spanish norms. However, there is a grammatical error in Camille's line (\"\n¿Por qué ya comprende...?\" should be \"¿Porque ya comprende...?\"), and the inconsistent use of 'tú' and 'usted' forms when addressing the listener slightly detracts from a completely smooth reading experience.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The most significant issue affecting fluency is the inconsistent use of formal ('usted') and informal ('tú') address forms for the implied listener (the podcast audience). Both Luc and Camille switch between these forms, which is unnatural and jarring for a native Spanish speaker in a continuous dialogue. The grammatical error (\"\n¿Por qué\" instead of \"Porque\") is a clear fluency flaw. Some phrases, like \"En lugar de eso\" for \"Voyez plutôt\" and \"estudio de repaso\" for \"bachotage\", while comprehensible, could have been rendered more naturally to better capture the original nuance.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "All technical terms such as \"pré-entraînement\" (preentrenamiento), \"affinage\" (ajuste fino), \"apprentissage par transfert\" (aprendizaje por transferencia), \"fenêtre de contexte\" (ventana de contexto), and \"ancrage\" (anclaje) are translated accurately and consistently throughout the text. This demonstrates a strong understanding of the domain-specific language.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation generally captures the conversational tone of a podcast. However, the inconsistent use of 'tú' and 'usted' forms for addressing the listener (the audience) is a significant oversight in contextual adaptation, as a consistent level of formality or informality is expected in a podcast setting. The phrasing in Camille's question \"La différence entre bachoter...?\" which becomes \"¿Cuál es la diferencia entre estudiar intensamente...?\" changes the interrogative tone slightly, making it less a rhetorical follow-up and more a direct question.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original text has been conveyed without omission. The core concepts and their explanations are fully present in the translation. No extraneous information has been added, and the content remains concise and clear.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is largely accurate in conveying the technical information and overall meaning of the podcast discussion. Key technical terms are handled very well, demonstrating a solid grasp of the subject matter. However, the inconsistent use of formal and informal address ('tú' vs 'usted') when speaking to the audience significantly detracts from its naturalness and fluency in Spanish. A basic grammatical error also impacts the overall quality. If these consistency issues were resolved, the translation would be of very high quality."
