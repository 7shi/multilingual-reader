    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally understandable, but several instances of awkward phrasing, literal translations, and grammatical slips (e.g., \"Las conocimientos\" instead of \"Los conocimientos\") detract from a smooth reading experience. Recurring extraneous characters (like `”}` at the end of some paragraphs) also disrupt readability. Some complex concepts are not as clearly explained due to omissions or simplifications.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation often feels unnatural and lacks the smooth, conversational flow of the original French podcast. Phrases like \"Es común que percibamos\" or \"Para que la tenga en cuenta\" sound clunky. Vocabulary choices are generally acceptable, but the overall rhythm and naturalness are compromised by literal interpretations and grammatical inconsistencies.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Some technical terms like 'pre-entrenamiento', 'ajuste fino', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', and 'anclaje' are translated correctly and consistently. However, there is a critical error where 'fenêtre de contexte' (context window) is confused with 'aprendizaje en contexto' (In-Context Learning), leading to a misrepresentation of a core technical concept. This significantly impacts the accuracy of the technical explanation.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation struggles to fully convey the original text's intent and purpose, which is to clearly explain complex AI concepts through analogies in a conversational podcast format. Many key analogies and clarifying phrases are omitted or significantly simplified, reducing the effectiveness of the explanation for the target audience. The engaging and explanatory tone of the original is often lost.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This is the weakest aspect of the translation. Numerous significant pieces of information are omitted, including key questions, clarifying statements, and crucial parts of analogies (e.g., Camille's explanation of *why* transfer learning works, Luc's distinction between temporary knowledge and permanent competence, the detailed 'cheat sheet' analogy, and Luc's clarification that the model itself doesn't learn from user discussions). These omissions severely impact the overall completeness and coherence of the information conveyed.",
      "score": 6
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation presents significant challenges in terms of information completeness, with many critical phrases, analogies, and explanations being omitted or poorly rephrased. A major terminology error regarding 'fenêtre de contexte' and 'apprentissage en contexto' leads to conceptual inaccuracies. While some parts are understandable, the overall fluency and readability are hampered by awkward phrasing and minor grammatical issues. The translation fails to effectively convey the depth and clarity of the original content, which is crucial for a technical podcast aimed at explanation."
