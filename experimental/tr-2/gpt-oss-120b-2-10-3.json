  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is entirely missing its content, presenting only speaker names. Therefore, there is no text for a target language reader to understand or follow, making readability impossible to assess, and practically non-existent.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is devoid of content, containing only speaker names. There are no sentences or phrases to evaluate for naturalness, grammar, or vocabulary choices. As such, fluency is completely absent.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Since almost all of the original text content is missing from the translation, no technical terms (or any terms for that matter) have been translated or handled. Therefore, terminology appropriateness cannot be assessed, and is effectively zero.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation lacks any substantive content from the original text. Without any translated expressions or information, the intent and purpose of the original cannot be conveyed, nor can any cultural adaptation or optimization be evaluated.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is nearly empty, with only speaker labels present. All important information from the original text has been omitted, making the translation completely incomplete and failing to convey any meaning whatsoever.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "The provided translation is critically incomplete. It contains only speaker names and no actual translated content from the original French text. This renders the translation unusable and impossible to evaluate against any quality criteria, as it conveys none of the original information."
