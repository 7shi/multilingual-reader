  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The readability is severely hampered by the frequent inclusion of translator comments and multiple translation options (e.g., 'term1 / term2') directly within the text. These elements break the flow, distract the reader, and prevent a smooth reading experience. Without these interjections, the underlying Spanish text is mostly understandable, but their presence makes the document unreadable as a final translation.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The fluency is heavily compromised by the translator's notes and alternative translations embedded in the text. These elements disrupt the natural rhythm and flow of the Spanish. Even discounting these, some phrases are slightly less natural than they could be (e.g., 'Más bien' for 'Voyez plutôt', 'esas informaciones' for 'ces informations', 'la solicitud' for 'le prompt' in the AI context).",
      "score": 5
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The selection of technical terms such as 'pre-entrenamiento', 'ajuste fino', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje contextual', and 'anclaje' is generally appropriate and consistent with common usage in Spanish AI contexts. However, the consistent presentation of multiple options for a single term (e.g., 'pre-entrenamiento o entrenamiento previo') detracts from the professional handling of terminology. The translation of 'prompt' as 'solicitud' is less common than using 'prompt' directly or 'instrucción' in this domain.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to convey the original intent and purpose of a podcast explaining AI concepts. The informal and explanatory tone is largely maintained. However, the presence of numerous translator's comments and alternative phrases indicates a lack of adaptation for a final, publishable output. These comments do not consider the target audience's expectation of a complete and polished translation.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All critical information from the original French text is present in the Spanish translation; there are no omissions. The main issue here is the inclusion of extraneous information in the form of translator's notes and suggested improvements, which, while not omissions, are not part of the requested translation output.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation is severely impacted by its format, resembling a draft or a set of options rather than a final deliverable. The frequent inclusion of internal comments, justifications, and multiple translation alternatives makes the text largely unusable as a coherent translation. While many technical terms are well-chosen and the core information is complete, these formatting issues critically undermine readability, fluency, and overall professionalism. For a usable translation, all internal comments and alternative phrasing must be removed, and a single, polished version of the text should be presented."
