    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains excellent clarity and flow. Sentence structures are logical and easy to follow, making complex AI concepts highly comprehensible for target language readers. The use of analogies is effectively translated, aiding understanding.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text generally sounds natural and smooth. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary. However, there are a few minor points that could be improved: 'Es todo eso' for 'C'est tout à fait ça' could be more idiomatic (e.g., 'Exactamente' or 'Así es'). 'Un estudio a corto plazo' for 'bachotage' is a bit weaker than 'empollar' or 'estudiar a saco'. The most significant fluency issue is the grammatically incorrect phrase 'hasta pronto al próximo episodio' at the very end, which should be 'hasta el próximo episodio' or 'hasta pronto en el próximo episodio'.",
      "score": 16

    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled very appropriately. Standard Spanish terms like 'preentrenamiento', 'ajuste fino', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', and 'aprendizaje en contexto' are correctly used. The inclusion of the English terms in parentheses (e.g., fine-tuning, In-Context Learning) is a helpful practice. 'Anclaje' is a good choice for 'grounding'. The term 'enraizamiento' provided in parentheses for 'ancrage' is also correct but 'anclaje' is more commonly used in this technical context.",

    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation perfectly captures the conversational and explanatory tone of a podcast. The intent and purpose of the original text, which is to demystify AI learning, are effectively conveyed. The analogies and explanations are adapted seamlessly to the target audience, maintaining the engaging style of the original.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original text is conveyed without any omissions. The explanations, distinctions between concepts (like temporary vs. permanent knowledge), and the functioning of new AI 'memory' features are all accurately translated and presented clearly, without redundancy.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "This is a very good translation that largely maintains the clarity, tone, and information of the original podcast transcript. The technical terminology is handled exceptionally well, and the conversational style is preserved. A few minor grammatical and idiomatic improvements would elevate the fluency further, particularly in the concluding remarks."
