    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation provided is almost entirely empty. There is no content to read or understand, making it completely unreadable. The only elements present are speaker names followed by ellipses or nothing, offering no meaningful text.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "With no actual translated text, it's impossible to evaluate fluency or naturalness. The output consists of speaker tags with no dialogue, therefore it lacks any linguistic flow or structure characteristic of a natural conversation.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "No technical terms from the source text have been translated or carried over to the target. The absence of content prevents any assessment of terminology appropriateness or consistency.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to convey the original text's intent or purpose because it is empty. There is no content to adapt contextually or culturally for the target audience.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is critically incomplete, as virtually all information from the original text has been omitted. The provided text only lists speaker names without any dialogue, thus failing to convey any of the source content.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "The provided 'translation' is essentially blank. It consists solely of speaker names with no actual dialogue translated from the original French. As such, it cannot be evaluated as a translation and scores zero across all criteria due to the complete lack of content."
