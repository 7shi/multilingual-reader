    "fluency": {

      "reasoning": "No technical terms from the original French dialogue (e.g., 'pré-entraînement', 'affinage', 'apprentissage par transfert', 'fenêtre de contexte', 'ancrage', 'In-Context Learning', 'Transformers') have been translated or addressed. The output provides no handling of terminology.",

It contains no actual translated content from the original French dialogue, rendering it entirely unhelpful as a translation. All evaluation criteria consequently receive a score of 0 due to the complete lack of translated text to assess."
