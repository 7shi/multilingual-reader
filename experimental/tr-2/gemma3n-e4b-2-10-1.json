    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally comprehensible, and most sentences are well-structured. However, the inconsistent use of 'tú', 'usted', and 'vosotros' forms (e.g., 'Podéis tomar' versus 'usted proporciona' and 'tus datos') creates a jarring reading experience and hinders overall fluidity. There's also a missing initial question mark in one instance.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The inconsistent address forms ('tú/vosotros' in some places, 'usted' in others) significantly impact the naturalness for native Spanish speakers. Phrases like 'presentársele' and 'Es por lo que' sound somewhat clunky. There is also a redundancy in the final paragraph with 'automáticamente' and 'de forma automática', and an incorrect plural 'Las informaciones' which should be 'la información'.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms like 'pre-entrenamiento', 'fine-tuning' (with its Spanish equivalent), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', and 'anclaje (grounding)' are handled appropriately and consistently. However, there is a key error in linking 'ventana de contexto' directly to 'ICL' (In-Context Learning) as an equivalent, when ICL is the approach enabled by the context window. Additionally, 'bachotage' is translated interpretively as 'aprender de memoria sin comprender' rather than simply 'cramming' or 'memorizing', and 'antisèche' is translated as 'resumen' which loses the nuance of a 'crib sheet'.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall tone of a tech podcast is mostly maintained. The addition of explanatory text for 'grounding' ('Este concepto busca asegurar que las respuestas de la IA estén firmemente basadas en los datos proporcionados') is a good adaptation to aid understanding. However, the inconsistent use of formal/informal address forms prevents a cohesive adaptation to a target audience, whether it be a general Latin American or Spanish audience, as it mixes conventions.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "Most of the original information is conveyed. There are minor omissions, such as 'en général' in one of Luc's lines. There are also instances of unnecessary additions or elaborations, like the extra clause explaining 'especialización' or the interpretive addition to 'bachotage' ('sin comprender'). The misrepresentation of ICL's relationship with 'ventana de contexto' also counts as an accuracy issue in information completeness.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully conveys the core concepts of AI learning discussed in the podcast. However, its quality is significantly hampered by consistent grammatical errors, particularly the inconsistent use of formal and informal pronouns ('usted', 'tú', 'vosotros'), which makes the text sound unnatural and unprofessional for a general audience podcast. Several instances of awkward phrasing, minor redundancies, and a notable factual error regarding the relationship between ICL and the context window further detract from its quality. While understandable, it lacks the polish and consistency expected of a high-quality translation."
