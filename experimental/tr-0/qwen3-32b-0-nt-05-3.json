    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is highly readable and comprehensible. The sentence structures are logical and easy to follow, mirroring the clear and conversational style of the original podcast. Complex concepts are explained effectively through well-translated analogies, making the content accessible to the target audience. There are no instances where the text is difficult to parse or understand.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text flows very naturally in Spanish. It sounds authentic to a native speaker, with appropriate vocabulary choices and correct grammar throughout. There are no awkward phrasing or unnatural constructions that disrupt the rhythm or meaning of the conversation. The dialogue feels like a genuine Spanish podcast.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled with excellent precision and consistency. Key terms such as 'preentrenamiento' (pré-entraînement), 'ajuste fino' (affinage), 'aprendizaje por transferencia' (apprentissage par transfert), 'ventana de contexto' (fenêtre de contexte), and 'aprendizaje en contexto' (apprentissage en contexte) are correctly translated and used. The inclusion of the English terms in parentheses (e.g., fine-tuning, grounding) aligns with the source text, and the adaptation of 'ICL' to 'AIC (Aprendizaje In-Contexto)' is a smart choice for the Spanish-speaking audience, providing clarity while maintaining the technical specificity.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation successfully conveys the original text's intent and purpose as an informative tech podcast. The tone is maintained, and the analogies used (e.g., school, university graduate, physicist, studying for an exam) resonate equally well in Spanish, effectively explaining the concepts. There are no cultural misinterpretations or inappropriate expressions, and the overall spirit of the original is perfectly preserved.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
