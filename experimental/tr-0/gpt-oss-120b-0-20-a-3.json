    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is severely incomplete, with most sentences either missing entirely or cut off mid-way. There are also instances of repeated words (\"porque porque\", \"cuando cuando\") and mixed languages (\"so\", \"Precisely?\"), making large portions of the text incomprehensible. While a few isolated sentences are translated correctly, the overall text is fragmented and impossible to follow, failing to convey any logical flow.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text lacks any natural flow or smoothness. It is characterized by extreme fragmentation, incomplete sentences, awkward repetitions, and direct French words or English words interspersed with Spanish. This results in a highly unnatural and jarring reading experience that would be utterly foreign to a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as \"pré-entraînement\" (pre-training), \"affinage\" (fine-tuning), \"apprentissage par transfert\" (transfer learning), \"fenêtre de contexte\" (context window), \"apprentissage en contexte\" (in-context learning), and \"ancrage\" (grounding) are almost entirely absent or rendered unintelligibly in the translation. The critical vocabulary for understanding the podcast's topic is missing, making it impossible to assess accuracy or consistency.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text's intent and purpose, which is to explain AI learning processes, are completely lost due to the extensive incompleteness and fragmentation of the translation. The dialogue structure is maintained structurally in terms of speaker turns, but the actual content and progression of ideas are absent. There is no cultural adaptation or optimization possible given the lack of coherent content.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This is the most significant failing of the translation. The vast majority of information from the original text is either omitted, severely truncated, or rendered incomprehensible. Critical explanations of AI concepts are entirely missing, preventing any understanding of the podcast's content. Only a handful of isolated sentences are fully translated, representing a minimal fraction of the source material.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation is extremely poor. It is severely incomplete, with most of the original dialogue missing or truncated into nonsensical fragments. The few parts that are translated contain repetitions, French words, and English words, making them unreadable and utterly unnatural. Key technical terminology and the core explanatory content of the podcast are entirely absent. As a result, the translation fails to convey any meaningful information or the original intent of the text. It appears to be a heavily broken or incomplete output, scoring extremely low across all evaluation criteria."
