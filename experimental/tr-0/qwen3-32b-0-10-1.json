    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish translation is generally easy to understand. Sentence structures are logical and clear, and the explanations of complex AI concepts are well-articulated. Minor grammatical errors, such as the repeated use of 'informaciones' instead of 'información' and an incorrect gender agreement for 'basado', do not significantly hinder comprehension but are noticeable to a native speaker.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "While most of the text flows naturally, there's a significant inconsistency in the use of personal pronouns and verb conjugations when addressing the audience. The translation frequently shifts between 'tú' (informal singular), 'usted' (formal singular), and 'ustedes' (formal plural) throughout the dialogue. This creates an unnatural and slightly awkward listening/reading experience for a native Spanish speaker. The use of 'afinamiento' instead of the more common 'ajuste fino' (noun form) also slightly detracts from perfect fluency. The 'informaciones' error also impacts naturalness.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The majority of technical terms are translated correctly and appropriately. 'Preentrenamiento', 'ajuste fino' (when first introduced), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'AIC (Aprendizaje In-Contexto)', and 'anclaje' are all standard and well-chosen. The slight inconsistency in using 'afinamiento' later for 'l'affinage' (instead of maintaining 'ajuste fino' or using 'afinado' as a participle) is a minor point. 'Guía' for 'antisèche' loses a bit of the 'crib sheet' nuance but doesn't misrepresent the core idea.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to maintain the conversational podcast style. However, the inconsistent formality in addressing the audience (shifting between 'tú', 'usted', and 'ustedes') is the primary issue. The French 'vous' in this context generally implies a formal or polite plural address, which would ideally be consistently rendered as 'ustedes' in Spanish for a podcast. This inconsistency impacts how well the dialogue adapts to a Spanish-speaking audience's expectations for a formal/semi-formal educational podcast.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All essential information from the original French text has been accurately conveyed in the Spanish translation. There are no omissions, additions, or misinterpretations of the core message or technical details presented in the dialogue.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation successfully conveys the technical content of the podcast episode, explaining complex AI concepts clearly. Most technical terms are handled correctly. However, the quality is hampered by significant inconsistencies in addressing the audience (mixing 'tú', 'usted', and 'ustedes'), which affects both fluency and contextual adaptation. Several minor grammatical errors, such as the repeated incorrect use of 'informaciones' and an agreement error for 'basado', also detract from an otherwise understandable text. Addressing these grammatical and consistency issues would elevate the translation to a very high standard."
