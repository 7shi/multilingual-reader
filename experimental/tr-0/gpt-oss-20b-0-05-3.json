    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation maintains a clear and logical sentence structure, making it easy for target language readers to follow the conversation. Complex AI concepts are explained clearly, reflecting the accessible style of the original podcast. The progression of ideas is smooth and coherent.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text generally flows well and sounds natural to a native speaker. Grammar is correct, and vocabulary choices are mostly appropriate. However, the direct borrowing of the French word « antisèche » instead of using a common Spanish equivalent like « chuleta » or « copia » significantly detracts from the naturalness and is a clear fluency error. The phrase « Vea más bien » for « Voyez plutôt » is also a bit literal, though understandable, and could be improved for greater idiomatic flow.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled exceptionally well. Concepts like « pré-entraînement » (preentrenamiento), « affinage » (ajuste fino), « apprentissage par transfert » (aprendizaje por transferencia), « fenêtre de contexte » (ventana de contexto), « apprentissage en contexte » (aprendizaje en contexto), and « ancrage » (anclaje) are accurately translated. The helpful addition of the English terms in parentheses (e.g., '(fine-tuning)', '(grounding)') further aids reader understanding, especially given the technical nature of the topic.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation effectively conveys the original text's intent and purpose, maintaining the conversational and explanatory tone of a podcast. The informal yet informative style is preserved, and the expressions are well-suited for a Spanish-speaking audience interested in technology. There are no cultural missteps, and the dialogue feels natural for the given context.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original text is accurately conveyed without any omissions. The translation provides a complete picture of the discussion on AI learning processes. There are no unnecessary redundancies, and the content remains concise and clear, mirroring the original's information density.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "This is a very good translation that largely succeeds in conveying complex technical information in an accessible, conversational style. The accuracy of terminology, readability, and information completeness are excellent. The main area for improvement is fluency, specifically addressing the direct loanword « antisèche » and occasionally slightly literal phrasing that could be made more idiomatic for a native Spanish speaker. Despite these minor points, the translation is high quality and effective."
