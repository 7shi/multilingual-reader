    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "Despite some grammatical inaccuracies and awkward phrasings (e.g., 'se recuerda', repeated 'informaciones'), the core message of each sentence is generally decipherable, and the overall flow of the conversation is maintained. However, a native speaker might stumble on these issues, requiring a slight pause to fully grasp the intended meaning.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation contains several grammatical errors ('trasfiere' instead of 'transfiere', 'se recuerda' instead of 'recuerda' or 'se acuerda de', 'haber nos escuchado' instead of 'habernos escuchado') and some awkward phrasing ('Eso es exactamente eso', 'astucia' for 'trick'). These issues detract significantly from the naturalness and make parts of the text sound less idiomatic and fluent to a native Spanish speaker.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The majority of technical terms ('preentrenamiento', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto') are translated accurately and appropriately, using standard equivalents. While 'afinamiento' (fine-tuning) and 'ancoraje' (grounding) might have more common alternatives like 'ajuste fino' and 'fundamentación' in the AI context, their usage is acceptable, especially as the original English terms are retained in parentheses, aiding clarity. The use of 'chuleta' for 'antisèche' is an excellent idiomatic choice.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation effectively preserves the conversational and explanatory tone of the original podcast. The analogies (e.g., university graduate, physicist, cycling, consultant) and explanations are well-adapted to the target audience, maintaining the intent of simplifying complex AI concepts. The informal yet informative style is consistent throughout, making it feel like a genuine podcast transcript.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All key concepts and details from the original French text are accurately and completely conveyed in the Spanish translation. There are no omissions of important information, such as the stages of AI learning (pre-training, fine-tuning, ICL), the distinction between temporary and permanent knowledge, or the explanation of chatbot 'memory' features. No unnecessary additions or redundancies were found.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation effectively conveys the core technical concepts of the original podcast, demonstrating a good understanding of the source material. However, it is marred by several grammatical errors and instances of unnatural phrasing that significantly impact its overall fluency and, to a lesser extent, its readability for a native Spanish speaker. While technical terminology is generally well-handled, a thorough review of grammatical structures, verb conjugations, and idiomatic expressions would significantly improve the quality and make the text sound more natural and professional."
