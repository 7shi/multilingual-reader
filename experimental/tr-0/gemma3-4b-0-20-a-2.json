    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally understandable, and the core concepts are conveyed. However, frequent shifts in the second-person address (from plural 'ustedes' or 'vosotros' implied for the audience, to singular 'tú' or 'usted') create a choppy and inconsistent reading experience. Additionally, some lexical choices like 'bachorear' and 'nota al pie' are incorrect or unnatural, requiring the reader to pause and potentially misinterpret the meaning. Grammatical errors, such as incorrect gender agreement for 'conocimientos', also detract from readability.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation suffers significantly from a lack of naturalness and smoothness. The primary issue is the inconsistent use of pronouns and verb conjugations when addressing the audience and Camille. It frequently switches between formal singular ('usted'), informal singular ('tú'), and occasionally maintaining an implied plural ('ustedes'/'vosotros'), which is highly jarring for a native speaker. Key vocabulary choices like 'bachorear' (for 'bachoter' / 'to cram') and 'nota al pie' (for 'antisèche' / 'cheat sheet') are unidiomatic or incorrect in Spanish, making the text sound very unnatural and amateurish. Grammatical errors like 'nuevas conocimientos' further reduce fluency.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are translated appropriately. 'Pré-entraînement' as 'pre-entrenamiento', 'affinage' as 'ajuste fino', 'apprentissage par transfert' as 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'fenêtre de contexte' as 'ventana de contexto', 'apprentissage en contexte' as 'aprendizaje en contexto', and 'Transformers' are correctly maintained. The minor redundancy of 'anclaje (anclaje)' instead of 'anclaje (grounding)' or just 'anclaje' is a slight blemish, but the term itself ('anclaje') is correct for 'grounding'. The choice to translate 'In-Context Learning' to 'Aprendizaje en Contexto' for the ICL acronym is acceptable, though sometimes the English acronym or its English expansion is preferred.",

    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "While the overall informative tone of a podcast is preserved, the adaptation falls short due to the inconsistent addressing of the audience, which is crucial for a conversational medium like a podcast. This inconsistency (mixing 'tú', 'usted', and 'ustedes' forms) breaks the listener's immersion and feels unprofessional. Furthermore, the failure to adapt idiomatic expressions like 'bachoter' and 'antisèche' using their natural Spanish equivalents ('empollar'/'chuleta'/'acordeón') demonstrates a lack of full contextual and cultural adaptation to how these concepts would be expressed colloquially in Spanish.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All information from the original French text has been fully transferred to the Spanish translation. There are no omissions of key details or concepts. The translation accurately reflects the discussion points and technical explanations provided in the source material, and no unnecessary information has been added.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation accurately conveys the technical content and is complete in terms of information. However, its overall quality is significantly compromised by a pervasive lack of fluency and naturalness. The inconsistent use of second-person address forms (tú/usted/ustedes) throughout the dialogue makes the text jarring and unprofessional for a podcast transcript. Additionally, several critical vocabulary choices are incorrect or unnatural, hindering comprehension and sounding unidiomatic to native Spanish speakers. Basic grammatical errors also appear. While the technical terminology is mostly handled well, these persistent issues severely detract from the translation's overall quality."
