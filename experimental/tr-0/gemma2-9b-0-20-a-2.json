    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is generally easy to understand, and the complex technical concepts are explained clearly, mirroring the original's communicative style. Sentence structures are mostly logical and easy to follow. However, the repeated omission of the initial inverted question mark (¿) before questions detracts from perfect readability in Spanish, as does an occasional awkward phrasing like the literal translation of \"Voyez plutôt\" to \"Voyez plutôt\".",

    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "This is the weakest aspect of the translation. The inconsistent use of formal ('usted'), informal ('tú'), and even plural ('nosotros') forms for addressing the audience/Camille throughout the dialogue is very jarring and unnatural for a native Spanish speaker. This is a major detractor from the text's naturalness and smoothness. Furthermore, there are several grammatical errors, such as 'los palabras' instead of 'las palabras', 'se recuerda' instead of 'recuerda', and incorrect gender agreement like 'esas conocimientos' instead of 'esos conocimientos' and 'Las nuevas conocimientos' instead of 'Los nuevos conocimientos'. The choice of 'afinamento' for 'fine-tuning' is less common and natural than 'ajuste fino' in the AI context.",
      "score": 10
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms are appropriately handled. 'Pre-entrenamiento', 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', and 'anclaje' (for grounding) are correct and commonly accepted terms in Spanish AI discourse. However, 'afinamento' for 'fine-tuning' is not the most common or idiomatic choice ('ajuste fino' is preferred). 'Enunciado' for 'prompt' is acceptable but 'prompt' itself or 'instrucción' might be more direct. The specific nuance of 'antisèche' (cheat sheet) is slightly lost with 'pista' (hint/clue). Despite these minor points, the core technical vocabulary is well-translated.",

    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text's informative and conversational podcast intent is largely conveyed. The analogies are well-preserved, which aids in explaining complex topics. However, the significant inconsistency in the form of address (mixing 'tú', 'usted', and 'nosotros' forms) creates a confusing and unnatural experience for the target reader, preventing a consistent conversational flow appropriate for a podcast.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original text has been conveyed without any significant omissions. The translation effectively covers all the discussed concepts, from pre-training and fine-tuning to in-context learning and the 'Memory' feature. The explanation of the differences between temporary knowledge and permanent competence is fully retained.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation effectively conveys the core technical concepts and information of the original French podcast. The explanations are generally clear, and most technical terms are accurately translated. However, the quality is significantly hampered by pervasive grammatical errors, particularly inconsistent gender and number agreement, and an erratic use of formal and informal forms of address ('tú' vs. 'usted'). This inconsistency makes the dialogue unnatural and jarring for a native Spanish speaker, detracting from the overall fluency and professionalism. While the content is understandable, these errors prevent the translation from feeling like a polished, native-speaker production."
