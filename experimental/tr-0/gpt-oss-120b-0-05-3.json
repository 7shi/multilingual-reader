    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely incomplete, with many sentences truncated or missing entirely. This makes the text incomprehensible and impossible to follow for any reader. Only a few short phrases or sentences are fully translated, and even some of those are awkward.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "Due to the extreme incompleteness of the translation, fluency is virtually non-existent. Most of the text consists of ellipses or single, unconnected words. Where short phrases do exist, some are grammatically awkward (e.g., 'Porque porque...', 'Cuando cuando...', 'Entonces entonces...') or contain untranslated French words (e.g., 'On' for 'On peut dire ça'). The text does not flow naturally in any meaningful way.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Crucial technical terms from the original text, such as 'pré-entraînement', 'affinage' (fine-tuning), 'apprentissage par transfert', 'fenêtre de contexte' (context window), 'apprentissage en contexte' (In-Context Learning - ICL), and 'ancrage' (grounding), are either entirely missing from the translation or are presented in truncated, unusable forms. While 'aprendizaje por transferencia' is correctly translated in one instance, the lack of context makes it unhelpful. There is no consistent handling or explanation of terms.",

    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails to convey the original text's intent, purpose, or context due to its severe incompleteness. The conversational tone of the podcast is lost entirely, as the dialogue is mostly missing. There's no effective conveyance of meaning or adaptation to a Spanish-speaking audience beyond the initial greeting.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The vast majority of the information from the original text is missing in the translation. Key explanations of AI concepts, analogies, and the core discussion points of the podcast episode are absent. The translated output consists mostly of fragmented sentences and placeholder ellipses, conveying almost no substantive content.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation is severely incomplete and largely unusable. Almost all the original content, including critical technical explanations and conversational flow, is missing. The output consists mostly of fragmented phrases, ellipses, and unhelpful repetitions. It fails to convey any meaningful information or maintain the original context, resulting in a text that is neither readable nor informative. It appears to be an extremely rough draft or an output that stopped prematurely."
