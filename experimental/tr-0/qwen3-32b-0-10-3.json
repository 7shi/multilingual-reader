    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is highly comprehensible, and complex technical concepts are explained clearly and logically. The sentence structures are easy to follow, allowing readers to grasp the content without difficulty.",
      "score": 18
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The fluency is significantly hampered by the inconsistent use of informal (\"tú\") and formal (\"usted/ustedes\") forms of address. The original French consistently uses \"vous,\" implying a consistent tone towards the audience. The translation frequently switches between these forms, creating an unnatural and disjointed dialogue flow. Additionally, the repeated use of \"por lo tanto\" (for \"donc\") can sound stilted, and the use of \"informaciones\" instead of the more common singular \"información\" contributes to minor awkwardness. The opening \"bienvenido\" should be \"bienvenidos\" when addressing a plural audience.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "The translation demonstrates excellent handling of technical terminology. Key terms such as 'preentrenamiento,' 'ajuste fino,' 'aprendizaje por transferencia,' 'ventana de contexto,' and 'anclaje' are translated accurately and consistently. The adaptation of 'ICL (In-Context Learning)' to 'AIC (Aprendizaje In-Contexto)' is a thoughtful and effective choice, aiding understanding in the target language context.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "While the core intent and information are conveyed, the contextual adaptation suffers due to the inconsistent use of address forms (tú/usted/ustedes). This creates an uneven and less natural tone for a podcast, which typically maintains a consistent rapport with its audience. The translation of 'antisèche' as 'una guía' also slightly misses the original's nuance of a 'cheat sheet' or quick, informal reminder, which could have been more aptly translated for better cultural resonance.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is highly complete, ensuring that all important information and nuances from the original French text are fully conveyed in Spanish. There are no omissions or unnecessary additions, and the explanations are faithful to the source content.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation effectively conveys the technical content and explanations of AI concepts. The handling of specialized terminology is a strong point. However, the inconsistent use of formal and informal address forms (tú, usted, ustedes) throughout the dialogue significantly impacts the naturalness and fluency, making the podcast sound less cohesive. Addressing this inconsistency and refining a few lexical choices would elevate the translation quality considerably."
