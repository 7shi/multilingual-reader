    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely incomprehensible. Most sentences are either truncated, marked with ellipses, or completely missing. This makes it impossible for a target language reader to understand the content or follow the conversation flow.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text lacks any semblance of naturalness or smoothness. It is riddled with incomplete sentences, untranslated fragments ('Et...', 'C...', 'Una...', 'On...'), and awkward repetitions ('Porque porque...'). The vocabulary is often missing or incorrectly used ('Precisó' instead of 'Precisamente').",

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While one specific phrase 'l'apprentissage par transfert' is correctly translated as 'aprendizaje por transferencia', the overwhelming majority of the text is either missing or too fragmented to assess technical terminology. There is no consistency due to the incompleteness.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text's intent and purpose are not conveyed at all because the translation is so incomplete. The dialogue flow, explanations, and nuances of the original podcast are entirely lost, meaning no contextual adaptation could occur.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This is the most critical failure. Almost all important information from the original text is omitted. The translation is a series of fragmented sentences and ellipses, translating only a minuscule portion of the original content. It is far from complete.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "The provided translation is extremely incomplete and appears to be a very rough, unfinished draft. The vast majority of the original content is missing, truncated, or poorly rendered, making the translated text largely unintelligible and completely unusable. It fails across all evaluation criteria due to its severe lack of completeness and coherence."
