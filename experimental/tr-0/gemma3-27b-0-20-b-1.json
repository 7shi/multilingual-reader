    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The Spanish text is highly readable and comprehensible. The sentence structures are logical and easy to follow, mirroring the clear and engaging style of the original podcast. Complex concepts are explained with clarity, making the content accessible to the target audience. There are no awkward constructions that impede understanding.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text sounds very natural and smooth to a native Spanish speaker. Vocabulary choices are appropriate and contemporary for a tech podcast. The conversational tone between Camille and Luc is perfectly maintained throughout the dialogue. Grammatically, the text is almost flawless, contributing to its excellent fluency.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled with excellent precision and consistency. Concepts like 'pré-entraînement' (pre-entrenamiento), 'affinage' (ajuste fino), 'apprentissage par transfert' (aprendizaje por transferencia), 'fenêtre de contexte' (ventana de contexto), 'apprentissage en contexte' (aprendizaje en contexto), and 'ancrage' (anclaje) are all translated using their correct and widely accepted Spanish equivalents in the AI/tech domain. The original English terms are also correctly retained in parentheses for clarity where applicable.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation effectively conveys the original text's intent and purpose as an informative yet conversational tech podcast. The analogies used are well-adapted, and the overall tone is consistent with the source. Expressions are naturally adapted for a Spanish-speaking audience, such as 'Vean esto' for 'Voyez plutôt' and 'Lo has entendido todo' for 'Vous avez tout compris', demonstrating a strong awareness of natural conversational flow in Spanish.",
      "score": 20
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original text is conveyed without any omissions. The explanations of complex AI concepts are fully present and accurately represented. No redundancy is introduced, and the content remains concise and clear. The only minor point is the translation of 'antisèche' as 'memoria', which slightly alters the nuance of 'cheat sheet' but does not lead to a loss of critical information, as the core meaning of providing an aid is still present.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "This is an outstanding translation that expertly captures the essence, tone, and technical details of the original French podcast. It is highly readable, fluent, and demonstrates excellent command of technical terminology in Spanish. The conversational style is perfectly preserved, making it an engaging listen for the target audience. Only a very minor lexical nuance prevents it from being absolutely perfect."
