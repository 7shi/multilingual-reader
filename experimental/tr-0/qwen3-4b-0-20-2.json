    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally comprehensible, but frequent grammatical errors, typos (\"conocencias,\" \"proporcionar,\" \"estos herramientas\"), and unnatural phrasing (e.g., \"bachear,\" mixing English verbs like \"fine-tunes\" into Spanish sentences) disrupt the reading flow. Concepts are mostly conveyed, but the awkward language requires more effort from the reader.",
      "score": 11
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "This is a significant weakness. The translation frequently uses literal equivalents that are unnatural or incorrect in Spanish (e.g., \"bachear\" for \"bachoter,\" \"antisèche\" remaining untranslated). There are also consistent grammatical errors such as gender and number mismatches (\"nuevas conocimientos,\" \"estos herramientas\") and verb conjugation errors (\"le proporcionar\"). The blending of English verbs directly into Spanish sentences (\"fine-tunes un modelo\") also severely detracts from naturalness.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Core technical terms like \"preentrenamiento,\" \"aprendizaje por transferencia,\" \"ventana de contexto,\" and \"anclaje\" are translated correctly. However, there's inconsistency in handling \"fine-tuning\" (sometimes translated as \"afinado,\" sometimes used directly as an English term, sometimes even as an English verb within Spanish syntax). The explanation for ICL also has a redundancy (\"ICL (Aprendizaje en contexto)\"). The main issues here are not with the technical terms themselves, but with the non-technical vocabulary used to explain them through analogies, which are often incorrect or unnatural.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation attempts to convey the original intent, but it struggles significantly with cultural adaptation, particularly concerning the analogies. Phrases like \"bachear para un examen\" and \"una antisèche\" are direct, literal translations that do not carry the intended meaning in Spanish and confuse the reader. This failure to adapt key explanatory analogies diminishes the effectiveness of the communication and the overall understanding of the concepts.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All substantive information from the original text has been carried over into the translation. No significant pieces of information or concepts appear to be missing. The clarity of this information is sometimes hampered by the fluency and readability issues, but the content itself is present.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation conveys the core information but suffers from significant issues in fluency, naturalness, and grammatical accuracy. While many technical terms are handled adequately, the use of awkward literal translations for analogies and common phrases, along with grammatical errors, makes the text feel unnatural and challenging to read for a native Spanish speaker. It requires considerable improvement in vocabulary choice, syntax, and grammatical consistency to achieve a professional standard."
