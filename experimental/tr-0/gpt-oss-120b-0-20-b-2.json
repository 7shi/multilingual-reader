    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The vast majority of the translated text is incomplete, consisting of ellipses, single words, or untranslated French phrases. While a few isolated sentences are correctly translated and comprehensible on their own, they do not form a coherent narrative. A reader would be unable to understand the podcast's content or follow the conversation flow due to the severe fragmentation.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text lacks any semblance of natural flow or smoothness. The conversation is constantly interrupted by untranslated segments, ellipses, and single-word placeholders, making it impossible to read as a natural dialogue. Even the correctly translated sentences, while individually fluent, are too sparse to establish overall fluency.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Some technical terms, like 'afinamiento' for 'fine-tuning' and 'aprendizaje en contexto' for 'in-context learning' (though fragmented), are correctly translated. However, the extensive incompleteness means most technical terms from the original are missing, and there's no context for evaluating consistency or appropriate explanations.",
      "score": 5
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text is a conversational podcast. The translation fails to adapt to this context entirely because of its extreme incompleteness. The back-and-forth dialogue, the explanations, the analogies, and the overall engaging tone of the podcast are completely lost. The intent and purpose of the original content are not conveyed.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This is the most critical failure. Nearly all information from the original text is missing from the translation. Most lines are either entirely blank, represented by '...', or contain only a few fragmented words. Key concepts, explanations of AI learning processes, and the core distinction between in-context learning and fine-tuning are absent.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is severely incomplete and largely unusable. Only a handful of sentences from the original source text have been translated into Spanish, while the vast majority of the content is missing, replaced by ellipses, single words, or untranslated French fragments. This renders the translation incoherent, incomprehensible, and devoid of almost all information from the original podcast. It fails to convey the topic, the dialogue, or the educational intent of the source material."
