    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The text is generally easy to follow, and sentence structures are clear. Concepts are explained logically. However, the inconsistent use of formal (\"usted\") and informal (\"tú\") address forms throughout the text can be slightly jarring for the reader, making it less smooth than it could be. Some phrases like \"Más bien, verás\" and \"Es pues un truco\" are a bit awkward or less natural in Spanish, which mildly affects the flow.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is mostly natural, but there are several instances that detract from perfect fluency. The grammatical error \"antes de que se aborde con la mecánica cuántica\" should be corrected to \"se enfrente a\" or \"aborde\". \"Más bien, verás\" for \"Voyez plutôt\" is not the most natural choice. \"Es decir,\" instead of \"Es decir, ¿cómo?\" or similar, and the lack of question marks for direct questions are minor but noticeable. The inconsistent use of \"tú\" and \"usted\" forms creates an unnatural and confusing tone for the listener. \"Ayuda\" for \"antisèche\" loses the specific nuance. \"Es pues un truco\" sounds a bit dated.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Most technical terms like \"pre-entrenamiento,\" \"aprendizaje por transferencia,\" \"ventana de contexto,\" \"aprendizaje en contexto,\" and \"anclaje\" are translated correctly and consistently. \"Ajuste\" for \"fine-tuning\" is acceptable, though \"ajuste fino\" would be more precise. The term \"prompt\" is sometimes translated as \"solicitud\" and sometimes used directly, but this minor inconsistency is not a major issue as \"solicitud\" is a valid translation.",

    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The overall intent and purpose of the podcast (explaining complex AI concepts in an accessible way) are conveyed effectively. The conversational tone between Camille and Luc is maintained. There are no significant cultural misinterpretations. However, the formality inconsistency (mixing \"tú\" and \"usted\") detracts from adapting the casual podcast context properly. The loss of nuance with \"antisèche\" (crib sheet) being translated as \"ayuda\" also slightly diminishes the context.",
      "score": 15
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original text has been conveyed without omission. There are no unnecessary additions or redundancies. The explanations provided for concepts like ICL and grounding are accurate and complete.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation accurately conveys the core technical information and maintains a conversational tone suitable for a podcast. However, it is hampered by several issues that affect its overall quality. The most significant is the inconsistent use of formal (\"usted\") and informal (\"tú\") address forms, which creates an awkward listening experience. Minor grammatical errors, less natural phrasing in a few places (e.g., \"Más bien, verás,\" \"se aborde con,\" \"Es pues un truco\"), and the loss of nuance for specific terms like \"antisèche\" also detract from an otherwise complete and understandable translation. Addressing these issues would significantly improve the fluency and readability."
