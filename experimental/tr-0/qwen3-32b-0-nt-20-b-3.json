    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The content is generally understandable for target language readers, and the sentence structures are mostly logical. Complex concepts like pre-training, fine-tuning, and in-context learning are explained clearly. However, minor grammatical errors ('re aprender' instead of 'reaprender', 'las informaciones' instead of 'la información') and inconsistencies in the form of address slightly detract from a perfectly smooth reading experience.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation suffers from significant issues in naturalness due to inconsistent use of pronouns and forms of address. The original French consistently uses 'vous' (plural/formal), but the Spanish shifts between 'ustedes' (implied by 'Imaginen', 'Miren') and 'tú' (e.g., 'tus datos', 'Lo tienes claro', 'tú proporcionas'). This creates a jarring and unnatural conversational flow for a native speaker. Additionally, some lexical choices like 'estudiar para un examen' for 'bachoter' or 'guía' for 'antisèche' are less idiomatic than they could be, missing the specific nuance of the original.",
      "score": 12
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Technical terms are handled very well. 'Preentrenamiento' for 'pré-entraînement', 'ajuste fino' for 'affinage' (with 'fine-tuning' included for clarity), 'aprendizaje por transferencia' for 'apprentissage par transfert', 'ventana de contexto' for 'fenêtre de contexte', and 'anclaje' for 'grounding' are all appropriate and standard. 'AIC (Aprendizaje In-Contexto)' is a good adaptation for 'ICL (In-Context Learning)'. The term selection is consistent throughout the text.",

    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The core intent and purpose of the original text are effectively conveyed. The explanations align with the context of a tech podcast. However, the inconsistent form of address (mixing 'tú' and 'ustedes') significantly impacts the conversational tone and directness expected in a podcast, failing to adapt optimally to how Spanish speakers address an audience in such a setting. Some opportunities for more vivid or culturally resonant idiomatic expressions were missed, particularly with 'bachoter' and 'antisèche'.",
      "score": 14
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All important information from the original text has been conveyed without omission. The explanations are clear and comprehensive, providing the necessary details for the reader to understand the technical concepts. There is no significant redundancy, and the content remains concise. A very minor nuance change occurs in the final question 'Ai-je besoin d'un consultant temporaire ou d'un expert permanent ?' being translated as '¿Necesito un consultor temporal o un experto permanente?', shifting from a general question to a first-person one, but it does not represent an information omission.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is strong in conveying technical information accurately and comprehensively, with excellent handling of specialized terminology. However, its overall quality is significantly hampered by a lack of naturalness and contextual adaptation. The most prominent issue is the inconsistent use of pronouns and forms of address ('tú' vs. 'ustedes') when addressing the audience, which makes the dialogue feel unnatural and disjointed for a Spanish-speaking listener. Several minor grammatical errors and less idiomatic lexical choices also detract from the fluency, preventing it from being a truly polished and engaging podcast script."
