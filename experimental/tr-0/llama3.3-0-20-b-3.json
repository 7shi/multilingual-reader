    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely comprehensible, explaining complex AI concepts clearly using appropriate analogies. However, the inconsistent use of formal/informal address (tú/usted) and several missing question marks slightly detract from the overall smooth reading experience, making some sentences feel incomplete or awkwardly addressed.",
      "score": 16
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The most significant issue affecting fluency is the inconsistent use of formal ('usted/ustedes') and informal ('tú') forms of address. The original 'vous' in a podcast context suggests a more formal or generalized audience, which should be consistently translated as 'usted' or 'ustedes'. The oscillation between forms is jarring and unnatural for a native Spanish speaker. Additionally, a minor tense error ('no se afinaba' instead of 'no es afinada') affects naturalness, and the frequent omission of opening question marks is a grammatical oversight.",
      "score": 13
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Key technical terms such as 'pre-entrenamiento', 'afinamiento' (with 'fine-tuning' in parentheses), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', 'ventana de contexto', 'aprendizaje en contexto', and 'anclaje' are translated correctly and consistently. The translation of 'prompt' as 'solicitud' is acceptable but could be more precise for an AI context. The choice of 'un resumen' for 'antisèche' misses the idiomatic meaning of a 'cheat sheet,' which is a minor but noticeable deviation from the original's nuance.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original intent and informative, conversational tone of the podcast are largely preserved. The analogies used to explain complex concepts translate well, such as the university graduate or riding a bike. However, the translation of 'antisèche' as 'un resumen' instead of a 'cheat sheet' slightly diminishes the intended nuance of a 'trick' or 'hidden aid,' which was relevant to the discussion about automated in-context learning.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "All the core information and explanations from the original French text are present in the Spanish translation. There are no notable omissions or additions that alter the factual content. The explanation of AI learning stages (pre-training, fine-tuning, transfer learning, in-context learning) and the distinction between temporary knowledge and permanent skill are fully covered.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is accurate in conveying the technical information and generally maintains the conversational tone of the podcast. Most technical terms are handled well. However, the quality is significantly hampered by inconsistent address forms ('tú' vs. 'usted/ustedes'), which creates an unnatural reading experience. Several missing question marks and a minor tense error also detract from the overall fluency and polish. While the information is complete, addressing these grammatical and consistency issues would elevate the translation considerably."
