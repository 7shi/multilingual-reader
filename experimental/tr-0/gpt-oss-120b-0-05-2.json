    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translation is largely unreadable. Most sentences are incomplete, indicated by ellipses, truncated words, or entirely missing content. This fragmentation makes it impossible to follow any coherent thought or dialogue. Many turns of phrase are simply fragments of French words or empty responses.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text is completely unnatural and lacks fluency. It's filled with truncated sentences, untranslated French words ('Et', 'Oui', 'On', 'No?'), and repetitive partial phrases ('Porque porque', 'Cuando cuando', 'Entonces entonces'). Grammatical structures are often cut off or non-existent, making it sound entirely fragmented rather than a natural conversation in Spanish.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "While a few technical terms like 'aprendizaje por transferencia' are correctly translated in isolated instances, the overwhelming majority of the context for these terms is missing. Many other technical terms from the original French (e.g., 'pré-entraînement', 'fenêtre de contexte', 'ancrage') are not translated or are presented as truncated fragments, making it impossible to evaluate their appropriate handling or consistency. The presence of untranslated French words further degrades this criterion.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The translation fails almost entirely to convey the original text's intent or purpose. Due to the extreme incompleteness and fragmentation, the conversation about AI learning processes is lost. There is no cultural adaptation as the text is not even a complete, coherent message in Spanish.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This is the most critical failure point. The vast majority of the original text's information is missing. The translation consists of fragmented sentences, ellipses, and empty dialogue turns. Important concepts, explanations, and conversational flow from the original French are almost entirely absent.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation is severely incomplete and fragmented, rendering it practically unusable. Most sentences are truncated, many original French words remain untranslated, and significant portions of the dialogue are simply missing or indicated by ellipses. This results in a complete loss of information, context, readability, and fluency. It does not convey the original message in any meaningful way."
