      "reasoning": "The translation maintains excellent clarity and logical flow. The Spanish sentences are well-constructed and easy for a native speaker to understand, even when dealing with complex AI concepts. The dialogue format is preserved naturally.",
      "score": 19
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The text reads very naturally in Spanish, with appropriate vocabulary and smooth sentence transitions. The dialogue sounds authentic. There are no noticeable grammatical errors or awkward constructions. The only very minor point is the translation of \"antis√®che\" as \"resumen\", which is acceptable but slightly less specific than the original's nuance of a \"cheat sheet\" or \"crib sheet\".",

    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "All technical terms are translated accurately and appropriately for the target audience.
