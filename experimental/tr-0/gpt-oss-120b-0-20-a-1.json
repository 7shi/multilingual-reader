    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "Only a handful of sentences (approximately 5 out of 43) are completely and coherently translated, making the vast majority of the text unreadable. Most lines are either entirely missing, truncated, or filled with ellipses and repetitive characters, preventing any meaningful understanding of the dialogue. For example, lines like 'Luc: Et…', 'Camille: ...', and 'Luc: PrecisamentePrecisely?' are prevalent throughout the translation, rendering it incomprehensible to a Spanish reader.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation severely lacks fluency and naturalness. While the few completely translated sentences are grammatically correct and natural-sounding in Spanish, they are isolated fragments within a largely incomplete and garbled text. The abundance of missing words, partial sentences, and filler characters (like '...', '???', 'so', 'p') disrupts any flow or natural rhythm, making it impossible to read smoothly.",
      "score": 2
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Given the extreme incompleteness of the translation, it is nearly impossible to evaluate the appropriateness and consistency of technical terminology. Most technical terms from the original French, such as 'pré-entraînement', 'affinage', 'apprentissage par transfert', 'fenêtre de contexte', 'apprentissage en contexte', and 'ancrage', are either entirely missing or only partially rendered without context. The few terms that do appear, like 'Tech Éclair', are not enough to demonstrate a proper handling of specialized vocabulary across the text.",
      "score": 1
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text's intent, purpose, and detailed explanations of AI learning concepts are completely lost in the translation. Due to the severe information loss and fragmented nature of the text, the conversational flow and the pedagogical goal of explaining complex ideas are not conveyed at all. There is no evidence of cultural adaptation or optimization, as the primary issue is the failure to translate the content itself.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This is the most critical failure point of the translation. The vast majority of information from the original text is omitted. Only a small fraction of sentences are fully translated, leaving huge gaps in the dialogue and critical explanations. Key concepts, analogies, and detailed breakdowns of AI mechanisms are entirely absent, making the translated text functionally useless for conveying the original message.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation is severely deficient across all evaluation criteria. The vast majority of the original French text is either missing, truncated, or rendered incomprehensibly in Spanish. Only a handful of isolated sentences are correctly translated, making the overall text unreadable, non-fluent, and completely devoid of the original information and context. It fundamentally fails to serve its purpose as a translation."
