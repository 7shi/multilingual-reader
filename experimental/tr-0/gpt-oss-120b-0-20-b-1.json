  "evaluation": {
    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The translated text is largely incomprehensible due to the vast amount of missing content. Most of the dialogue lines are replaced with ellipses or incomplete words, making it impossible for any reader to follow the conversation or understand the complex concepts being discussed about AI learning. The flow is completely broken.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation lacks any semblance of naturalness or smoothness for a native Spanish speaker because most of the original content is missing. While a few isolated phrases might be grammatically correct, the overall output is a fragmented collection of ellipses and incomplete thoughts, which is not fluent in any sense.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Crucial technical terms and concepts central to the discussion (e.g., 'pré-entraînement', 'apprentissage par transfert', 'fenêtre de contexte', 'ancrage') are almost entirely absent or only partially hinted at. The few translated segments don't consistently or accurately convey the original technical vocabulary, making it impossible to assess proper terminology handling.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "The original text's intent to explain AI learning processes in a podcast format is completely lost. The severe omissions mean that the conversation's purpose, the speaker's turns, and the overall context are not conveyed at all. No cultural or linguistic adaptation can be assessed when the core information is missing.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "This is the most critical failure. Almost all important information from the original text has been omitted. The translation consists primarily of ellipses and single words, meaning that practically none of the content, explanations, or dialogue is present. It does not convey the original message.",
      "score": 0
    },
    "overall_comment": "The translation is severely incomplete and largely unusable. The vast majority of the original dialogue is replaced by ellipses or fragmented words, rendering the text incomprehensible and failing to convey any meaningful information. It appears to be an unfinished or corrupted translation rather than a genuine attempt to render the source text into Spanish. All evaluation criteria suffer drastically due to the extensive omissions."
