    "readability": {
      "reasoning": "The readability is significantly hampered by numerous grammatical errors, particularly in gender and number agreement ('las conocencias' instead of 'los conocimientos' repeatedly), and awkward sentence structures that are direct translations from French. Phrases like 'se percibe a menudo estas IA como' instead of 'a menudo se perciben estas IA como' make the text less fluid and harder to read naturally. The non-standard term 'el bacheo' also creates a comprehension hurdle.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "fluency": {
      "reasoning": "The translation consistently lacks naturalness. There are many instances of incorrect grammar, such as 'bienvenido en' instead of 'bienvenidos a', 'Ella lee' instead of 'Lee', 'se ataque' instead of 'aborde' or 'se enfrente a', and 'La IA lo hace lo mismo' instead of 'La IA hace lo mismo'. The repeated errors in gender and number agreement ('las conocencias', 'Las nuevas conocimientos', 'estos herramientas') make the text sound very unnatural and ungrammatical to a native Spanish speaker. Key terms like 'bachotage' and 'antisèche' are either poorly translated ('el bacheo') or left untranslated, further detracting from fluency.",
      "score": 7
    },
    "terminology": {
      "reasoning": "Some technical terms are handled correctly, such as 'preentrenamiento', 'afinamiento' (fine-tuning), 'aprendizaje por transferencia', and 'ventana de contexto'. However, there are notable failures: 'bachotage' is poorly translated as 'el bacheo', which is not a standard term for 'cramming' in Spanish (e.g., 'empollar', 'estudiar de memoria'). 'Antisèche' is left untranslated, when a term like 'chuleta' or 'apunte' would be appropriate. Additionally, the explanation for ICL is redundant ('o ICL (Aprendizaje en contexto)') and the 'grounding' term is mistranslated in the parenthetical as '(anclaje)' instead of maintaining the original English or offering a different Spanish synonym.",
      "score": 9
    },
    "contextual_adaptation": {
      "reasoning": "While the general intent of the podcast is conveyed, the translation often feels like a direct word-for-word rendering rather than an adaptation for a Spanish-speaking audience. The conversational tone is somewhat maintained, but the numerous grammatical errors and unnatural phrasing impede the smooth flow expected in a podcast. The lack of cultural adaptation for terms like 'bachotage' and 'antisèche' means the expressions are not optimized for the target culture.",
      "score": 8
    },
    "information_completeness": {
      "reasoning": "The translation successfully conveys all the important information from the original text without any significant omissions. However, there is some minor redundancy, such as the repeated explanation of 'Aprendizaje en contexto' for ICL and 'anclaje (anclaje)' for 'grounding'. While complete, the grammatical and stylistic issues in other areas occasionally make the information less clear than it could be.",
      "score": 17
    },
    "overall_comment": "This translation struggles significantly with fluency, grammar, and naturalness in Spanish. There are numerous errors in gender and number agreement, awkward direct translations, and poor choices for common expressions and technical jargon (e.g., 'bachotage', 'antisèche'). While the core information is present, the pervasive issues make the text feel unpolished and difficult to read as a native speaker. The lack of proper linguistic and cultural adaptation is a major drawback, suggesting a highly literal translation process."
